**The Four Agile Values and Slack**  
https://slack.engineering/the-four-agile-values-and-slack/  
While there are a variety of agile frameworks to choose from, the principles of agile development span each of these methods, and are the heart of what it means to be an agile team. In this post we are going to cover the four agile values and some of the ways we use Slack (the Product) at Slack (the Company) to empower teams. 

**MIT Mathlets**  
https://mathlets.org/  
Here you will find a suite of dynamic Javascript "Mathlets" for use in learning about differential equations and other mathematical subjects, along with examples of how to use them in homework, group work, or lecture demonstration, and some of the underlying theory. There are also voice-over animated demos.

**Catalyst - Simplest serverless development suite**  
https://catalyst.zoho.com/  
Catalyst by Zoho is a highly scalable serverless platform that lets developers build and deploy world-class solutions without managing servers. Even better, you pay nothing till you deploy the project to production. Get a free, full-featured sandbox and up to 125 million free invocations.

**Deploying a Cloud Spanner-based Node.js application**  
https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/developers-practitioners/deploying-cloud-spanner-based-nodejs-application  
We begin by describing the steps to deploy the application on Cloud Run, and end with a discussion of best practices around tuning sessions, connection pooling & timeouts for applications using Cloud Spanner in general, which were adopted in OmegaTrade as well.

**Ultra: Deno + React: No build, no bundle, all streaming**  
https://github.com/exhibitionist-digital/ultra  
Ultra is a web framework that leans hard into your browser's native features. Embrace the future of ES Modules, Import Maps, and Web Streams. All while supporting some of the non-standards that many normal people love for some reason (JSX and TypeScript).

**Towards a Reliable Device Management Platform**  
https://netflixtechblog.com/towards-a-reliable-device-management-platform-4f86230ca623  
At Netflix, hundreds of different device types, from streaming sticks to smart TVs, are tested every day through automation to ensure that new software releases continue to deliver the quality of the Netflix experience that our customers enjoy. In addition, Netflix continuously works with its partners (such as Roku, Samsung, LG, Amazon) to port the Netflix SDK to their new and upcoming devices (TVs, smart boxes, etc), to ensure the quality bar is reached before allowing the Netflix application on the device to go out into the world. The Partner Infrastructure team at Netflix provides solutions to support these two significant efforts by enabling device management at scale.

**ES2022 feature: class static initialization blocks**  
https://2ality.com/2021/09/class-static-block.html  
For setting up the static part of a class, we only have static fields. The ECMAScript proposal introduces static initialization blocks for classes, which, roughly, are to static classes what constructors are to instances.

**Reducing Carbon Emissions On The Web**  
https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/09/reducing-carbon-emissions-on-web/  
Websites, unfortunately, aren’t as environmentally friendly as we might like them to be. This article contains some thoughts and experiences from trying to clean them up.

**Migrating Notion's marketing site to Next.js**  
https://www.notion.so/blog/migrating-notion-marketing-to-next-js  
One of the most challenging aspects of being an engineer is knowing when to introduce abstractions and when to keep things simple. How many times have you invested time in building a scalable system up front, planning for growth that never comes to fruition? We're certainly no stranger to this age-old engineering dilemma.

**API 的一码多端方案 —— Uni API**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/0lMjHYZV7zaJg1I145M7qA  
还记得前段时间大火的社区团购，多个小程序投放的复杂场景出现，且时间紧任务重，一码多端成为刚需。阿里数字农业团队在经历了盒马集市的业务洗礼后，Uni API 的雏形在业务中孕育而生，之后多方共同参与，诞生出了 Uni API。它解决了小程序之间以及 Web 的 API 差异，为你实现小程序以及 Web 的一码多端提供坚实基础。

**Javascript Anti Debugging — Some Next Level Sh*t (Part 2— Abusing Chromium Devtools Scope Pane)**  
https://medium.com/@weizmangal/javascript-anti-debugging-some-next-level-sh-t-part-2-abusing-chromium-devtools-scope-pane-b2796c00331d  
Abusing the Chromium Devtools Scope Pane can allow execution of Javascript by the devtools while the main thread is paused by the debugger! I used this trick to create a very powerful anti debugging technique library that tracks the flow of debugging done by the user and changes the flow of execution accordingly — check out the DEMO.

**React Native's Many Platform Vision**  
https://reactnative.dev/blog/2021/08/26/many-platform-vision  
React Native has been very successful at raising the bar for mobile development, both at Facebook and elsewhere in the industry. As we interact with computers in new ways and as new devices are invented, we want React Native to be there for everyone. Although React Native was originally created to build mobile apps, we believe that focusing on many platforms and building to each platform’s strengths and constraints has a symbiotic effect. We have seen huge benefits when we extended this technology to desktop and virtual reality, and we're excited to share what this means for the future of React Native.

**iOS Engine Choice In Depth**  
https://infrequently.org/2021/08/webkit-ios-deep-dive/. 
How does Apple justify such a policy? Particularly since last winter, when it finally (albeit haltingly, eventually) became possible to set a browser other than Safari as the default?

**uBlock Origin—everything you need to know about the ad blocker**  
https://addons.mozilla.org/blog/ublock-origin-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-ad-blocker/  
If you install uBlock Origin and do nothing else, right out of the box it will block nearly all types of internet advertising—everything from big blinking banners to search ads and video pre-rolls and all the rest. However if you want extremely granular levels of content control, uBlock Origin can accommodate via advanced settings. We’ll try to split the middle here and walk through a few of the extension’s most intriguing features and options…

**Best Practices for Logging in Node.js**  
https://blog.appsignal.com/2021/09/01/best-practices-for-logging-in-nodejs.html  
Since we understand how essential logging is, we need to practice good logging habits. We should accumulate logs that make it easier to diagnose the root cause of problems and solve potential issues before they impact end-users. This article will outline some best practices to follow when writing logs in a Node.js application.

**Lastmile CLI: Simulate all the things**  
https://eng.lyft.com/lastmile-cli-simulate-all-the-things-87928bce29ec  
This article is a history of how we have thought about testing golden path flows that interact with hardware and how we found an approach we are really happy with.

**Streaming Real-Time Analytics with Redis, AWS Fargate, and Dash Framework**  
https://eng.uber.com/streaming-real-time-analytics/  
While we researched approaches used for building real-time dashboards (example), we did not find an end-to-end solution, considering how rich visualization can be achieved at lower cost. We considered different visualization approaches and also looked at commercial solutions to come up with our choices. Another differentiating aspect was that our solution also addresses the need for a “single source of truth” on Amazon S3 (Amazon’s “simple storage service”), from which both streaming and batch processed dashboards would to be sourced, rather than hooking directly into the Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose stream itself. This intermediate storage lets us recover data (for the streaming window) with a replay. We production tested our visualizations with thousands of users for low load times and reliability.

**CacheLib, Facebook’s open source caching engine for web-scale services**  
https://engineering.fb.com/2021/09/02/open-source/cachelib/  
Today, we’re announcing the release of CacheLib, a pluggable in-process caching engine to build and scale high-performance services collaboratively. CacheLib’s C++ library enables developers to build and customize scalable and concurrent caches through its simple API. We are also open-sourcing CacheBench, a benchmarking tool for evaluating caching performance on diverse production workloads.

**Use of artificial intelligence for image analysis in breast cancer screening programmes: systematic review of test accuracy**  
https://www.bmj.com/content/374/bmj.n1872  
Current evidence for AI does not yet allow judgement of its accuracy in breast cancer screening programmes, and it is unclear where on the clinical pathway AI might be of most benefit. AI systems are not sufficiently specific to replace radiologist double reading in screening programmes. Promising results in smaller studies are not replicated in larger studies. Prospective studies are required to measure the effect of AI in clinical practice. Such studies will require clear stopping rules to ensure that AI does not reduce programme specificity.

**A Guide to Interfaces in Go**  
http://fast4ward.online/posts/a-guide-to-interfaces-in-go/  
In Go, interfaces take the center stage. They are more flexible and more powerful than their counterparts in other languages. When coming to Go from another language, this may not be immediately obvious, yet this realization is quite important for our ability to write well-structured and decoupled code. Let’s explore exactly how flexible they are and how we can make the best use of them.

**Why Erlang?**  
https://www.fredrikholmqvist.com/posts/why-erlang/  
Therefore, when leads say "programming languages don't matter", this is what they mean; upholding and steering a project over time is more important than choice of programming languages. A well maintained project can easily outperform a lesser kept project with better technological choices.

This issue boils down to non-technical people making technical decisions. I’ve talked about this in previous articles that I wanted to spend a little bit more time on. My main issue here can be with Agile management, if you have, but this is not about Agile at all. Let me say that again; this is not about Agile.
