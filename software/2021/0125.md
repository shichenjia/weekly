**HTML and CSS still isn’t about painting with code**  
https://christianheilmann.com/2021/01/21/teaching-html-and-css/  
The other day I had a friend come to my place with the request to “learn HTML and how web sites work”. We spent a few hours playing with the topic and she got excited and quite far into it. The whole thing reminded me about a real problem when it comes to teaching people HTML. We keep fast-tracking the learning to the fun part of building visual things with it.

**The Philosophy of Svelte**  
https://blog.scottlogic.com/2021/01/18/philosophy-of-svelte.html  
Describing Svelte as a philosophy surprised me. But as I tried to organise my thoughts to write this blog post, I arrived at what I believe to be Svelte’s underlying philosophy.

**Servers: Cool Once Again**  
https://css-tricks.com/servers-cool-once-again/  
So: servers. They are just good at doing certain things (says the guy typing into his WordPress blog). There does seem to be some momentum toward doing less on the client, which I think most of us would agree has been taking on a bit much lately, which asset sizes doing nothing but growing and growing.

**The long future of artificial intelligence**  
https://thesephist.com/posts/ai/  
Decades have passed, and the complexity of microprocessors used in Internet-scale computing systems dwarf the complexity of even the largest Jacquard patterns. Today, we imagine usurping the capabilities of the human brain with software instead of looms. We’ve gotten closer, but I’m not sure that computers as we know it will get us there yet. Inventing the computer and the deep neural network may still be one of the first few steps in replicating the magic of the enchanted loom, and in this post, I want to explore the future that I imagine in our steps forward.

**Uber’s Real-time Data Intelligence Platform At Scale: Improving Gairos Scalability/Reliability**  
https://eng.uber.com/gairos-scalability/  
Leveraging data-driven sharding and query routing, the platform can support four times the concurrent queries than our previous solutions. Some critical clusters have even stabilized from one outage per month to zero outages per month. Since launch in December 2018, the platform has been scaled over ten times with intelligent caching, with the cache hit rate reaching over 80 percent.

**Introducing WebSockets, HTTP/2 and gRPC bidirectional streams for Cloud Run**  
https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/serverless/cloud-run-gets-websockets-http-2-and-grpc-bidirectional-streams  
We are excited to announce a broad set of new traffic serving capabilities for Cloud Run: end-to-end HTTP/2 connections, WebSockets support, and gRPC bidirectional streaming, completing the types of RPCs that are offered by gRPC. With these capabilities, you can deploy new kinds of applications to Cloud Run that were not previously supported, while taking advantage of serverless infrastructure.

**How I Build JavaScript Apps In 2021**  
https://timdaub.github.io/2021/01/16/web-principles/  
It's now roughly seven or eight years that I'm building dynamic front ends for the web. From digital art wallets to games (1, 2) and synthesizers, I've seen it all. And since my process of creation has dramatically changed over the years, today, I'd like to share how I'm developing web apps in 2021.

业务压力大也许只是一时的，可以选择压力小一点的业务线，或是找到应对压力的办法；没有话语权也许是因为本身能力不够或是沟通不到位，不能帮助合作伙伴解决问题；至于成长，核心在于自己是否愿意挤出时间、挤出精力，持续地学习。

**Upgrading to React 17: How to Fix the Issues and Breaking Changes**. 
https://eng.wealthfront.com/2021/01/14/upgrading-to-react-17-how-to-fix-the-issues-and-breaking-changes/  
React 17 mostly focused on under the hood changes that will make it easier for consumers to gradually upgrade in the future. There were no new features and the breaking changes, in theory, affected few consumer components. While upgrading at Wealthfront was certainly more straightforward than past versions, we still had a few issues to overcome. Since React 17 is still relatively new, we thought it might be helpful to share these blockers we came across and how we resolved them.

**The Next Gen Database Servers Powering Let's Encrypt**  
https://letsencrypt.org/2021/01/21/next-gen-database-servers.html  
Let’s Encrypt helps to protect a huge portion of the Web by providing TLS certificates to more than 235 million websites. A database is at the heart of how Let’s Encrypt manages certificate issuance. If this database isn’t performing well enough, it can cause API errors and timeouts for our subscribers. Database performance is the single most critical factor in our ability to scale while meeting service level objectives. In late 2020, we upgraded our database servers and we’ve been very happy with the results.

**An unlikely database migration**  
https://tailscale.com/blog/an-unlikely-database-migration/  
When I first joined Tailscale almost a year ago, one of the first things I asked Crawshaw was, “So, what database do you use? MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite maybe?”, knowing that he loved SQLite.

Ultimately, building software is a complex and deeply human activity. Everything is contextual and there are rarely easy answers. Most meaningful progress happens through consensus, compromise, luck, and lots of hard work. In the end, a lot can be understood through the lens of values.

This was an incredibly hard decision, especially with my background and history around Open Source. I take our responsibility very seriously.

**张小龙：微信十年的产品思考**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/LwkXAhTHx3fkToQMsy5lDg  
微信十年，如果非要用两个词来描述微信，我想，一个是连接，一个是简单。连接是很美的。因为世界的运行就是靠万事万物的连接而进行的。对产品来说，做连接，意味着做服务的底层设施，因为基于连接可以演变出来的结果是最丰富的。很多的社交产品可能也做连接，但它止步于人，微信的连接范畴更大，公众号、小程序目标都是连接，连接人和内容、人和服务，包括微信支付也可以认为是一种货币的连接，视频号的目标也是连接。重心不是在做内容，而是在做底层的连接，这很重要。这也是为什么我们会提“去中心化“，因为连接和中心化是有些排斥的。再说简单。我用简单来作为美观，实用，合理，优雅的代名词。简单是很美的。从一个物理公式到一个日常用品，往往是简单的是更好的。实现同样一个目标，有一千种方法，但只有最简单的方法是最美的。正是因为有一千种方法存在，所以要真正做到简单是很难的。
