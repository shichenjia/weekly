**Everything Assistant at I/O**  
https://developers.googleblog.com/2021/04/assistant-sessions-io-2021.html  
We’re excited to host the first ever virtual Google I/O Conference this year, from May 18-20, 2021 – and everyone's invited! Developers around the world will join us for keynotes, technical sessions, codelabs, demos, meetups, workshops, and Ask Me Anything (AMA) sessions hosted by Googlers whose teams have been hard at work preparing new features, APIs, and tools for you to try out.

**“行业毒瘤”低代码**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/nux9xJko6N1tLTK23-ZbzA  
使用低代码平台写出来的代码既难以维护，又难以测试，同时它还给行业传递了非常不好的信号，“程序员的价值是不值钱的”，最终造成的结果就是一些不具备编程专业技能的人，使用极不趁手、效率低下的工具来做写代码的工作。这是非常危险的，这类低代码工具就是行业毒瘤！另附：[低代码不是行业毒瘤，你才是！](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/369369503)、[有没有可能未来是需要精彩的你们](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/369180849)、[最近大热的「低代码」效率工具平台，有前途吗？](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/MoRmQIahbo1reNKu_tucfw)。

**Mind the platform execution gap**  
https://martinfowler.com/articles/platform-prerequisites.html  
Developer productivity platforms are increasingly recognised as a way to manage the cognitive load of engineering teams and decrease time to market for new features. However, there are baseline capabilities that organisations need to cultivate in order to successfully execute on a plaform strategy. The platform team needs to think of the platform as a software product, needing dialog with its users, attention to reliable operations, and a healthy team environment.

**Why UML "Really" Died**  
https://buttondown.email/hillelwayne/archive/why-uml-really-died/  
There’s this post going around the internet called [Has UML died without anyone noticing?](https://garba.org/posts/2021/uml/), In the piece, Ernesto Garbarino says that UML was killed by decreasing standards among programmers: “Agile was the assassin and user stories were her deadly, poisonous arrow heads (pun intended).” If there’s one theme of this newsletter, it’s that we shouldn’t trust simple answers. The real world is complicated. Releated: [Can Formal Methods Succeed where UML Failed?](https://buttondown.email/hillelwayne/archive/can-formal-methods-succeed-where-uml-failed/).

**What Serverless Computing Is and Should Become: The Next Phase of Cloud Computing**  
https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2021/5/252179-what-serverless-computing-is-and-should-become/fulltext  
In 2010, some of us co-authored a Communications article that helped explain the relatively new phenomenon of cloud computing.4 We said that cloud computing provided the illusion of infinitely scalable remote servers without charging a premium for scale, as renting 1,000 servers for one hour costs the same as renting one server for 1,000 hours, and that economies of scale for the cloud provider allowed it to be surprisingly inexpensive. We listed challenges to cloud computing, and then predicted that most would be overcome so the industry would increasingly shift from computing inside local data centers to "the cloud," which has indeed happened. Today two-thirds of enterprise information technology spending for infrastructure and software is based in the cloud.

**Model-based tool for Service Design**  
https://modeling-languages.com/model-based-tool-for-business-service-design/  
Service Design has its roots at the confluence of various disciplines, mainly marketing, but also design or management. There is consequently a myriad of definitions of what Service Design is, but all of them agree that its main goal is the development or improvement of services that satisfy the user needs.

**What's Next? The Future of Node.js**  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrnToZP47Ro  
A 27-minute session by Red Hat and IBM’s Joe Sepi, Michael Dawson and Bethany Griggs on tracking what’s coming up in the Node world, Node’s future (though Beth reminds us “there is no roadmap”) and how you can get involved if you so wish. Releated: [How to Use ECMAScript Modules in Node.js](https://dmitripavlutin.com/ecmascript-modules-nodejs/).

**Using asynchronous web APIs from WebAssembly**  
https://web.dev/asyncify/  
The I/O APIs on the web are asynchronous, but they're synchronous in most system languages. When compiling code to WebAssembly, you need to bridge one kind of APIs to another—and this bridge is Asyncify. In this post, you'll learn when and how to use Asyncify and how it works under the hood.

**The Humble `<img>` Element And Core Web Vitals**  
https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/04/humble-img-element-core-web-vitals/  
Images have also been a key part of the web. They communicate ideas instantly, but they are also a lot heavier than text to load. This means that it’s essential to get loading and displaying them right, if you want to give your users a fantastic first impression. 

**2020 中国独立开发者生存现状调研报告**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/x_mkNh21e3EbN8g-Cmq5Mw  
不过目前中国独立开发者群体远远小于欧美等发达国家，且中国国内鲜有以独立开发者为视角的报告，原因有很多，其中中国软件开发者工作时间过长，自由职业文化相对较弱等为主要原因。但种种迹象表明独立开发者这一群体在不断增多，为此 SegmentFault 思否通过调查问卷、采访、现有数据分析等手段撰写此《2020中国独立开发者生存现状调研报告》。目的是让包括独立开发者在内的对独立开发者感兴趣的人群了解这个职业和这个群体。

**Rust GUI 编程漫谈：超越 Web 与原生 GUI**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/rN-OASHWWvblNwodazt0Rg  
自打我有了一个写 Uncode IDE 的小目标之后，我开始寻找一些适用于 Rust 语言的 GUI 框架。对于未来而言，基于 Rust 语言写 GUI 提供了大量的优点。于是，在我这一个月的努力之下，我尝试了三个不同风格的 Rust GUI 框架：终于总算是勉强能跑起来了。顺便一提，这三个框架都不是稳定版本，功能都不够完善。

**程序员应该知道的那些画图工具**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/oWDoWEHNqdKWmHX9akcxPQ  
现在写技术文章不但要写技术细节，图还得画的好看。对于表达思路和架构来说，图确实挺直观的，这篇文章介绍一下常见的绘图工具。大家可以看自己的喜好自行选择。在早期写 golang-notes 的时候，想要向那些写 RFC 文档和早期的 unix 大神们致敬，所以比较喜欢 ascii 图，这种图的好处是你可以直接将图表内嵌在文档内部，不需要有附件。有利于单文件传播。用来画 ascii 的图工具有不少。另附：[Swimlanes.io – generated editable sequence diagrams](https://swimlanes.io/)。

**CSRF, CORS, and HTTP Security headers Demystified**  
https://blog.vnaik.com/posts/web-attacks.html  
With an increasing number of breaches, intrusions, and data thefts, securing a web application is extremely important. On the other hand, programmers often do not have a strong grasp of how attacks work and how to mitigate them. This post attempts to close that gap a little.

**Scaling monorepo maintenance**  
https://github.blog/2021-04-29-scaling-monorepo-maintenance/  
At GitHub, we serve some of the largest Git repositories on the planet. We also serve some of the fastest-growing repositories. Each day, the largest repositories we host become even larger. About a year ago, we noticed that the job we use to repack Git repositories began hitting our self-imposed timeouts on larger repositories. Even when expanding these timeouts, failing maintenance on these repositories has generally been the cause of degraded performance that is hard to mitigate. Today, these problems do not exist. All of our work here is being contributed to the open source Git project, and will be available in an upcoming release.

**How Datadog's IT Team Automated Monitoring Third Party Accounts**  
https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/engineering/how-datadogs-it-team-automated-monitoring-third-party-accounts/  
Employees at all modern software companies use dozens and sometimes hundreds of outside pieces of software to do their jobs and to develop their product. From your company email to the services that you host your product on, to everything in between, most employees log into multiple accounts every day. So how do you keep track of all of these accounts to ensure that your employees are using them securely, make sure that you aren’t overspending on the services, and make sure that bad actors aren’t finding their way into your systems? 

**How to deploy an application on Friday**  
https://circleci.com/blog/deploy-on-friday/  
However, with a strong set of practices and a reliable deployment pipeline, there should be no reason why a deployment cannot happen anytime — even on a Friday afternoon. In this post, we’ll cover some of the steps DevOps teams should take to ensure that they can safely and reliably deploy almost any change and not lose their weekends.

**How we are closing the gap on replicating everything in GitLab Geo**  
https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2021/04/29/how-we-are-closing-the-gap-on-replicating-everything-in-gitlab-geo/  
GitLab Geo is the solution for widely distributed development teams and for providing a warm-standby as part of a disaster recovery strategy. Geo replicates your GitLab instance to one or more local, read-only instances. In early 2020, it took 3.5 months of solid work to implement replication of a new data type in Geo. One year later, support can be added within a month – including development and all required reviews. How did we do it? First, let me introduce you to Geo.

**We were promised Strong AI, but instead we got metadata analysis**

The late nineties dream of search engines was that they would use grand-scale Artificial Intelligence to find everything, understand most of it and help us retrieve the best of it. Not much of that has really come true.

**How Facebook encodes your videos**  
https://engineering.fb.com/2021/04/05/video-engineering/how-facebook-encodes-your-videos/  
Facebook deals with its high demand for encoding high-quality video content by combining a benefit-cost model with a machine learning (ML) model that lets us prioritize advanced encoding for highly watched videos. By predicting which videos will be highly watched and encoding them first, we can reduce buffering, improve overall visual quality, and allow people on Facebook who may be limited by their data plans to watch more videos.

**Web Languages as Compile Targets**

**Why All Engineers Must Understand Management: The View from Both Ladders**  
https://somehowmanage.com/2021/04/30/why-all-engineers-must-understand-management-the-view-from-both-ladders/  
When I wrote advice about micromanaging for managers, a few friends asked me about how to deal with their (micro)manager, so I wrote about how to handle your manager. The latter piece seemed to be a lot more useful. I also wrote about how managers should avoid cognitive biases, and most questions I got were about engineers who felt their managers were victims of those biases. You see the pattern. I write for managers, I get interest from ICs. It could be that I‘m reaching the wrong audience, but I think there’s something deeper going on.

**Google Translate: One billion installs, one billion stories**  
https://blog.google/products/translate/one-billion-installs/  
The passenger I met isn't alone. Google Translate on Android hit one billion installs from the Google Play Store this March, and each one represents a story of people being able to better connect with one another. By understanding 109 languages (and counting!), Translate enables conversation and communication between millions of people which otherwise would have been impossible. And Translate itself has gone through countless changes on the path to one billion installs. Here’s how it has evolved so far.

**7 years of open-source database development**  
https://www.philipotoole.com/7-years-of-open-source-database-development-lessons-learned/  
rqlite has existed for 7 years, and there is still so much to do. Transactions, better client libraries, proper Kubernetes support, performance — the appeal of software is that it’s infinitely extensible, and can always be improved. I’m pretty certain it’ll never get to a place where I will say “it’s done”. Instead, like an old soldier, it’ll probably just fade away.

-- THE END --
