**Beyond no-code: no-learn and no-work software development**  
https://modeling-languages.com/going-beyond-no-code-solutions-no-learn-and-no-work-development/  
No-code solutions aim to empower non-technical people to create their own software solutions with zero need to code anything at all. The term no-code is sometimes used as a slight variation of low-code. In fact, we can often see tools defining themselves as no-code/low-code tools.

**Time flies in Google Earth’s biggest update in years**  
https://blog.google/products/earth/timelapse-in-google-earth/  
In the biggest update to Google Earth since 2017, you can now see our planet in an entirely new dimension — time. With Timelapse in Google Earth, 24 million satellite photos from the past 37 years have been compiled into an interactive 4D experience. Now anyone can watch time unfold and witness nearly four decades of planetary change.

**Real-world CSS vs. CSS-in-JS performance comparison**  
https://pustelto.com/blog/css-vs-css-in-js-perf/  
Don’t use runtime CSS-in-JS if you care about the load performance of your site. Simply less JS = Faster Site. There isn’t much we can do about it. But if you want to see some numbers, continue reading. Releated: [Less JavaScript more HTMX](https://changelog.com/jsparty/171).

**Is React a Library or a Framework? Here's Why it Matters**  
https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/is-react-a-library-or-a-framework/  
Developers have spent a great deal of time talking about what React is. But they have left out why this topic matters so greatly for anyone who builds React applications.

**Web vs native - make the right choice in 2021**  
https://areknawo.com/web-vs-native-make-the-right-choice-in-2021/  
As a web developer, I believe in the Web as a development platform. In fact, it’s my (and many other’s) go-to platform for creating amazing apps easily and quickly. However, I do acknowledge the advantages of native development - especially from the user perspective. More advanced functionalities, better performance and compatibility with the underlying platform - there’s certainly much to appreciate in native apps. So the question is - when to choose which route? Now, as a web developer, I know my opinion might be a bit skewed, but I’ll try to do my best. Usually, native apps are better in scenarios where web apps are worse, so we’ll start with the Web's pros and cons while comparing it to native on the side. Let’s get started!

**Slow and Steady: Converting Sentry’s Entire Frontend to TypeScript**  
https://blog.sentry.io/2021/04/12/slow-and-steady-converting-sentrys-entire-frontend-to-typescript  
Recently, Sentry converted 100% of its frontend React codebase from JavaScript to TypeScript. This year-long effort spanned over a dozen members of the engineering team, 1,100 files, and 95,000 lines of code. In this blog post, we share our process, techniques, challenges, and ultimately, what we learned along this journey.

**用低代码平台开发比用IDEA还牛逼吗？**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/ChaYhQJrQgzqih9CqyIQeQ  
有没有发现，每隔几年总会有一些火热的前沿词汇出现在我们面前，比如：云原生、微服务、中台、Servless、低代码等等。那么你是否有想过，这些概念的背后是什么推动的呢？结论并不难发现，从各种概念的目标上去合并同类项，它们的本质目标都是：提高研发效率！在提高研发效率的道路上，各种方案都有着不同的侧重点，有的着力于基础设施的完善，有的着力于系统架构的优化，有的着力于生产工具的更新。拿最近最为热门的低代码平台来说，更多的是站在生产工具这一侧重点之上。另附：[啥是低代码？感觉很熟悉的样子](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=Mzg3NjIxMjA1Ng==&mid=2247489424&idx=1&sn=a055ac6c477280f82ae1f45a833bc278)。

**CSS is a Strongly Typed Language**  
https://css-tricks.com/css-is-a-strongly-typed-language/  
[CSS is a declarative, domain-specific programming language](https://notlaura.com/css-is-a-programming-language/). It is also strongly typed. For the most part, values in CSS stay declared as authored. If a value is invalid the browser throws the entire property away.

**Content-aware image resizing in JavaScript**  
https://trekhleb.dev/blog/2021/content-aware-image-resizing-in-javascript/  
So, with this article I want to do three things: Provide you with an interactive content-aware resizer so that you could play around with resizing your own images; Explain the idea behind the Seam Carving algorithm; Explain the dynamic programming approach to implement the algorithm (we'll be using TypeScript for it). 

**Mutation Testing**  
https://testing.googleblog.com/2021/04/mutation-testing.html  
For those who are not familiar with it, mutation testing is a method of evaluating test quality by injecting bugs into the code and seeing whether the tests detect the fault or not. The more injected bugs the tests catch, the better they are.

**How Google’s Site Reliability Engineering Team Uses Go**  
https://opensource.googleblog.com/2021/04/actuating-google-production-how-googles-sre-team-uses-go.html  
In 2013-2014, Google’s SRE team realized that our approach to production management was not cutting it anymore in many ways. We had advanced far beyond shell scripts, but our scale had so many moving pieces and complexities that a new approach was needed. We determined that we needed to move toward a declarative model of our production, called "Prodspec," driving a dedicated control plane, called "Annealing."

**SQLite the only database you will ever need in most cases**  
https://unixsheikh.com/articles/sqlite-the-only-database-you-will-ever-need-in-most-cases.html  
The name SQLite is a nice name, but the "lite" part is misleading, it sounds like it is only useful for tiny things - which is very wrong. SQLite should be named AwesomeSQL, because that is what it is. SQLite is probably the only database you will ever need in most cases.

Some of you have noticed the past few weeks and months that a serious attempt to bring a second language to the kernel was being forged. We are finally here, with an RFC that adds support for Rust to the Linux kernel.

Hi, my name is Ivan Kutskir, I am 29 y.o. and I live in Prague, the Czech Republic. I created Photopea , an advanced image editor which works in a web browser. There were 7 million visitors in July. I started to work on it in 2012, the first version was published in 2013, it was just my hobby until 2016, when I graduated and started to work on it full-time. I did not fully "believe" in Photopea until 2017, when I started to monetize it (with ads) and was able to make $400 a month :)
