**Babel is used by millions, so why are we running out of money?**  
https://babeljs.io/blog/2021/05/10/funding-update  
So, our ask is to help fund our work, via Open Collective and GitHub Sponsors. Though individual contributions do matter (and we deeply appreciate them), we are really looking for more companies to step up and become corporate sponsors, alongside our current sponsors like AMP, Airbnb, Salesforce, GitPod, and others. If it would be better for your company to sustain us in other ways, we are also open to hearing any ideas. Reach out to us directly or by email at team@babeljs.io.

https://blog.replit.com/url-shortener-16-lines  
In a few years, you’ll be able to build your own operating system. You’ll have a place to browse the web, find people to hang out with, play games, learn, and do deep work. You’ll be able to discover apps from all over the world, modify them, and build your own with your friends– a true multiplayer computing experience that you can customize and call home. Today, the launch of Replit Apps marks the first step towards that future. Apps, right now, is a gallery to browse and discover new repls from the community. Everything from games, to generative art, to machine learning models are on here. 

**First Public Working Draft of MiniApp Manifest**  
https://www.w3.org/blog/news/archives/9050  
The MiniApps Working Group has published a First Public Working Draft of MiniApp Manifest. This specification is a registry of supplementary members for the Web Application Manifest and the Web App Manifest – Application Information specifications that provide additional metadata to an application manifest to describe MiniApps. This JSON-based manifest file enables developers to set up basic information, window style, page route, and other information of a MiniApp. The manifest also includes information about the window style like the navigation bar, title, window background color, page routing information, and the widgets that are part of a MiniApp.

**React vs React Native: Differences, Advantages & Limitations**  
https://buttercms.com/blog/react-vs-react-native  
This article will compare React vs React Native. We'll explore the differences between the two libraries, and their shared history. My hope is that this article will provide web and app developers with more detail on the concepts behind both libraries, as well as their unique advantages and limitations for specific applications.

**Hi~ 这将是一个通用的新手引导解决方案**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/vrDQEGgOSnKBvHuwZV6vSA  
不管是老用户还是新用户，在产品发布新版本、有新功能上线、或是现有功能更新的场景下，都需要一定的指导。功能引导组件就是互联网产品中的指示牌，它旨在带领用户参观产品，帮助用户熟悉新的界面、交互与功能。与 FAQs、产品介绍视频、使用手册、以及 UI 组件帮助信息不同的是，功能引导组件与产品 UI 融合为一体，不会给用户割裂的交互感受，并且不需要用户主动进行触发操作，就会展示在用户眼前

**软件工程的最大难题**  
http://www.ruanyifeng.com/blog/2021/05/scaling-problem.html  
软件开发有一个难题，叫做"扩展"（scaling），即怎样服务更多的用户。 你有10000个并发用户，跟你有10个并发用户，这是完全不同的概念，哪怕功能完全相同，背后的实现是完全不一样的。并发用户数上升一个数量级，软件就必须重构，大量问题随之产生。国外有很多专著，研究这个问题。前些日子，我读到一篇文章，推荐了两本书。第一本叫做《加速：构建和扩展高性能技术组织》，第二本叫做《规模：生物，城市和公司的普遍法则》。我看了这两本书的介绍，觉得很有启发，下面就做一些摘录。

After you purchase a Cloud Run committed use discount, it automatically applies to all aggregated Cloud Run CPU, memory, and request usage in a region, across all projects in your billing account.

**Half a million lines of Go**  
https://blog.khanacademy.org/half-a-million-lines-of-go/  
When we started Goliath, no one on the team knew Go beyond the experiments we ran to validate that Go would be a better choice for us than our other options. Today, all of our backend and full-stack engineers write Go, and our incremental delivery of Goliath has vaulted us over a big milestone: More than 500,000 lines of Go now running in production. This seemed like a good point to reflect on Go itself. Releated: [Thoughts on how to structure Go code](https://changelog.com/posts/on-go-application-structure).

**Boosting Dropbox upload speed and improving Windows’ TCP stack**  
https://dropbox.tech/infrastructure/boosting-dropbox-upload-speed  
How we got there is an interesting and instructive tale—we learned that Windows has some tracing tools beyond our Linux-centric experience, and working with Microsoft engineers led to both a quick workaround for our users and a long-term fix from Microsoft. Teamwork! We hope our story inspires others to collaborate across companies to improve their own users’ experiences.

**How Pinterest Fights Spam Using Machine Learning**  
https://medium.com/pinterest-engineering/how-pinterest-fights-spam-using-machine-learning-d0ee2589f00a  
Our anti-spam system consists of both reactive and proactive components to effectively counter adversarial abusers — users who intentionally try to evade the system. Our proactive system consists of sophisticated machine learning models, whereas the reactive system includes both rules executed in a real-time rules engine and lightweight machine learning models. We not only use the latest modeling techniques but also iterate on these models at regular intervals by adding new data and exploring new technical breakthroughs to either maintain or improve their performance over time to effectively address spam.

**The end of “your database”**  
https://sdtimes.com/data/the-end-of-your-database/  
Databases are still very much at the heart of the modern web, just as servers still dutifully power the expanding array of serverless offerings. But it’s today possible—and common—to author and deploy rich, interactive web applications without managing database infrastructure or even knowing how the data is ultimately stored.

**Introduction to database testing**  
https://circleci.com/blog/intro-db-testing/  
In software development, processing and storing data in different states reflects the business rules an application is built on. The heart and soul of any software application is the data that is persisted in databases for retrieval and further processing. The database system (SQL or Non-SQL) chosen for an application must serve the required data processing and storage needs of the application. What better way to determine that than to set up a system to test the database to ascertain its capabilities?

Managing big data has gotten easier in some ways, thanks to better tools and technology. But it’s still a sizable challenge, especially when maintaining privacy and security in data-dispersed environments. So how will we tackle these challenges in the future? The smart folks at Gartner have some ideas, which they shared during last week’s Data & Analytics Summit.

**Interactive Components: Bring your Prototypes to Life**  
https://www.uxpin.com/studio/blog/interactive-components/  
To visualize something well and make sure the design gets properly coded without too much back-and-forths with a developer, you’ll need a nice working prototype. Prototypes with interactive components also help when showing your design to stakeholders or other team members—or for usability testing. For a prototype to be great, it needs to resemble a real-life product—so it should include as many opportunities for user interactions, as possible, which will give it that WOW effect—and ultimately speed up your design process, making it more efficient and effective.

One year ago I paused my programming life and started writing a novel, with the illusion that my new activity was deeply different than the previous one.
