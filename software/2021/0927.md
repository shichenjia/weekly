**How Big Tech Runs Tech Projects and the Curious Absence of Scrum**  
https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/project-management-at-big-tech/  
Project management is a topic most people have strong opinions on, and I’m no exception. To answer the question of how different companies run engineering projects, I pulled in help from across the industry. In this issue we’ll cover: Project management approaches across the industry; Project management at Big Tech; The lack of Scrum at Big Tech; How should you run projects in your team? Releated: [Scrum and Agile are one in the same, and it’s killing us](https://sredmond.medium.com/scrum-and-agile-are-one-in-the-same-and-its-killing-us-c67974bb2f48).

**Flow makes HTML faster**  
https://www.ekioh.com/flow-browser/  
A fundamental rethink of browser design, Crafted for multi-core silicon, Flow changes everything. Flow uses multithreading for page layout – multiple page elements are positioned concurrently. Flow draws HTML elements directly on the GPU – this dramatically improves rendering performance and helps keep the CPU free for faster JavaScript execution.

**Reactive Clojure: You don't need a web ramework, you need a web language**

Photon distributes reactive Clojure/Script programs across the client/server system (like distributed map reduce). **Imagine React.js but full stack, incremental view maintenance all the way from database views to DOM views as one streaming computation.** Functional programming teaches us how to achieve distribution with the full, undamaged composition power of lisp: higher order functions, closures, macros and all.

**How We Got to LiveView**  
https://fly.io/blog/how-we-got-to-liveview/  
LiveView strips away layers of abstraction, because it solves both the client and server in a single abstraction. HTTP almost entirely falls away. No more REST. No more JSON. No GraphQL APIs, controllers, serializers, or resolvers. You just write HTML templates, and a stateful process synchronizes it with the browser, updating it only when needed. And there's no JavaScript to write.

In a centralized environment, this may be an ideal setup. But what happens when the internet becomes decentralized?

**A Content Model Is Not a Design System**  
https://alistapart.com/article/a-content-model-is-not-a-design-system/  
Do you remember when having a great website was enough? Now, people are getting answers from Siri, Google search snippets, and mobile apps, not just our websites. Forward-thinking organizations have adopted an omnichannel content strategy, whose mission is to reach audiences across multiple digital channels and platforms.

**Stimulus 3 + Turbo 7 = Hotwire 1.0**  
https://world.hey.com/dhh/stimulus-3-turbo-7-hotwire-1-0-9d507133  
Stimulus 3 + Turbo 7 paint the full picture of how my ideal stack for front-end development should look under the umbrella of Hotwire 1.0. This is how we're building Basecamp 4. This is how we built HEY. Now it's going to be the default answer to JavaScript in Rails 7 together with the new import-map approach. All the missing pages are being printed.

**Human Computer Interaction, Iconography, Setka, and TinyMCE**  
https://www.tiny.cloud/blog/hci-setka-tinymce-icons/  
In fact, iconography is a deep area of study that’s tied into the essential field of Human Computer Interaction (HCI). This post summarizes some of the HCI history, and shows how iconography works in both TinyMCE WYSIWYG and the Setka design tool features.

In our cycle, we try to highlight particular aspects of why it is so good and so beneficial to start or continue a working career with CKSource - whether as a software developer or as any other responsible, open-minded, and creative person. This time, we take a closer look at the agile project management that is in heavy use at CKSource.

**A Live Look at Serverless Cloud**  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TKedWps7nU  
Jeremy Daly of Serverless Inc (and GM of Serverless Cloud, specifically) demonstrates the new platform live in person in a 50-minute session. A particularly useful and practical talk especially for JavaScript developers keen to give serverless a try.

**Netflix Cloud Packaging in the Terabyte Era**  
https://netflixtechblog.com/netflix-cloud-packaging-in-the-terabyte-era-d6869b4b84ae  
As Netflix becomes a producer of award winning content, the studio and content creation needs are also pushing the envelope of technology advancements. As an example, cloud-based post-production editing and collaboration pipelines demand a complex set of functionalities, including the generation and hosting of high quality proxy content. Supporting those workflows poses new challenges to our packaging service.

**The First Rule of Machine Learning: Start without Machine Learning**  
https://eugeneyan.com/writing/first-rule-of-ml/  
Applying machine learning effectively is tricky. You need data. You need a robust pipeline to support your data flows. And most of all, you need high-quality labels. As a result, most of the time, my first iteration doesn’t involve machine learning at all.

**Robots Must Be Ephemeralized**  
https://blog.evjang.com/2021/09/ephemeralization.html  
In a previous blog post, I also discussed how iterating in simulation solves some tricky problems around new code changes invalidating old data. Simulation makes this a non-issue because it is relatively cheap to re-generate your dataset every time you change the code. Despite significant sim2real advances in the last decade, I must confess that three years ago, I was still somewhat ideologically opposed to doing robotics research in simulation, on the grounds that we should revel in the richness and complexity of real data, as opposed to perpetually staying in the safe waters of simulation.

**Six Reasons Why Virtual Reality Is a Game-Changing Computing and Communication Platform for Organizations**  
https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2021/10/255706-six-reasons-why-virtual-reality-is-a-game-changing-computing-and-communication-platform-for-organizations/fulltext  
The COVID-19 pandemic created unprecedented disruptions to businesses, forcing them to take their activities into the virtual sphere. At the same time, the limitations of remote working tools have become painfully obvious, especially in terms of sustaining task-related focus, creativity, innovation, and social relations. Some researchers are predicting that the lack of face-to-face communication may lead to decreased economic growth and significant productivity pitfalls in many organizations for years to come.

**Teaching by filling in knowledge gaps**  
https://jvns.ca/blog/2021/09/20/teaching-by-filling-in-knowledge-gaps/  
I’ll start out by talking about a “backwards” approach to learning that I think a lot of you will recognize (do projects first without fully understanding what you’re doing, fill in missing knowledge after), and then talk about I try to teach in a way that works better with that mode of learning.

**All things are possible with code, but not everything is beneficial**  
https://daverupert.com/2021/09/all-things-possible-not-everything-beneficial/  
In my weird role as hybrid contractor/consultant I get asked, “Is it possible to do {{some_feature}}?” and what goes through my head is a bastardized version of the Apostle Paul saying: All things are possible (with code), but not everything is beneficial.

**Sketching 101: Fidelity**  
https://blog.prototypr.io/sketching-101-fidelity-8f1507984b04  
it makes a difference whether your sketches are rough or polished. Because of the time you invest and because roughness (low fidelity) encourages ambiguity and possibilities, where polish (high fidelity) supports decision making and locking things in. 

**莫谓字母无机巧，铁画银钩见锋芒：西文书法（Calligraphy）初探**  
https://sspai.com/post/68953  
Calligraphy，一种或许可以大概理解为「西文书法」的艺术。但是，有经验的学习者一般会避免「书法」这个词，因为 calligraphy 和我们所熟知的汉字书法实在有太大的区别。把「书法」这个名字强加于它，会导致大量的误会和刻板印象。

**A different kind of keyboard**  
https://ianthehenry.com/posts/peggi/  
I’ve always been attracted to chording keyboards in theory, but I lack whatever childhood musical training is required to wrap my fingers around them. So I made something else: an arpeggio keyboard. Peggi is an eight-key keyboard that fits on the back of your phone. While chording keyboards require you to press multiple keys at the same time, arpeggio keyboards only ask that you type multiple keys in sequence.

自然不断地在重复简单的单元，最终变成各种复杂的结构。只要细心观察，我们经常能够发现很多循环迭代的例子，例如树的枝干、河的支流、蜿蜒的海岸线、血液循环的管道系统，世界本质上是非线性的，而分形是复杂非线性特征的一种几何表现，用分形语言去描绘大自然丰富多彩的面貌是最适宜的。
