**Photoshop's journey to the web**  
https://web.dev/ps-on-the-web/  
Over the last three years, Chrome has been working to empower web applications that want to push the boundaries of what's possible in the browser. One such web application has been Photoshop. The idea of running software as complex as Photoshop directly in the browser would have been hard to imagine just a few years ago. However, by using various new standardized web technologies, Adobe has now brought a public beta of Photoshop to the web.

**Software Architecture Patterns: 5 minute read**  
https://orkhanscience.medium.com/software-architecture-patterns-5-mins-read-e9e3c8eb47d2  
When someones dives into the world of Software Engineering, one day he will need to learn the basics of Software Architecture Patterns. When I was new to coding, I didn’t know where to get a resource for a brief introduction to the existing architecture patterns so that it would not be too detailed & confusing but rather very abstract and simple to understand. It had been a problem until I found a book Software Architecture Patterns by Mark Richards. Here I want to share with you some of the most important parts of the book and architecture patterns.

**Supercharging Node with Rust**  
https://yieldcode.blog/supercharge-nodejs-with-rust/  
Node isn’t the fastest framework out here. It’s not the slowest either, v8 is doing wonders to its speed, but nevertheless, if we setup an unfair battle between Node and say Rust; Node will lose.

**My Foreword to "The Art of Agile Development"**  
https://martinfowler.com/articles/art-agile-foreword.html  
When we wrote the Manifesto for Agile Software Development, our supporters were a small minority trying to change an industry. Now, twenty years later, “agile” is mainstream. But I write “agile” in scare quotes for a reason—lots of people say they are doing agile software development, indeed most genuinely believe that, but their actions bear little resemblance to the vision we shared two decades ago. Releated: [Agile Principles: Continuous Delivery](https://www.simplethread.com/agile-principles-continuous-delivery/).

**Desktop Automation with RobotJS**  
https://blog.zt4ff.dev/nodejs-desktop-automation-with-robotjs-but-with-a-program-that-could-get-you-hired-fired  
Some while ago, I saw a meme video of "a day in the life of a software engineer" where the engineer wrote a script to make his computer switch on automatically, open Slack, and move the mouse at regular intervals while he is asleep to make it appear he is online and working at the same time. We will be writing a similar program with NodeJS using the RobotJS module. RobotJS is a cross-platform desktop automation library.

**New HTTP standards for caching on the modern web**  
https://httptoolkit.tech/blog/status-targeted-caching-headers/  
If you run any large public-facing website or web application on the modern web, caching your static content in a CDN or other caching service is super important. It's also remarkably complicated and confusing. Fortunately, the HTTP working group at the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) is working to define new HTTP standards to make this better. There's been a lot of work here recently to launch two new HTTP header draft standards intended to make debugging your caching easier, and to provide more control over your cache configuration.

**仅仅过去 4 年，微软最终放弃了 Electron**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/EeOd-Ln9RUNmeWLlMkJmIg  
前不久，微软 Teams 高级副总裁宣布，Teams 将放弃 Electron，转而匹配微软自己的 Edge WebView2 渲染引擎以寻求性能提升。官方声称，调整之后 Teams 的内存消耗量将直接减半，并有望以 Teams 2.0 的形象随 2022 年末上市的 Windows 11 一同亮相。

**大漠：我认识的 W3C 规范**

**A Deep Dive Into object-fit And background-size In CSS**  
https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/10/object-fit-background-size-css/  
In this article, we will go through how object-fit and background-size work, when we can use them, and why, along with some practical use cases and recommendations. Let’s dive in.

**How I made Google’s data grid scroll 10x faster with one line of CSS**  
https://medium.com/@johan.isaksson/how-i-made-googles-data-grid-scroll-10x-faster-with-one-line-of-css-78cb1e8d9cb1  
In my company, we use Google Search Console to check indexing status and optimize visibility of our websites. You can also check which external websites link to your page, and as I was browsing the “Top linking sites” page I noticed major scroll lag. This happens when choosing to display a larger dataset (500 rows) instead of the default 10 results.

**What is IPLD?**  
https://blog.ipfs.io/what-is-ipld/  
Most people would already know what IPFS is and what it offers to the average developer in terms of distributed data. However, IPFS isn't the only thing that one should understand about this revolutionary system. Underneath IPFS is a system known as IPLD that deals with all the heavy lifting that IPFS does to store data on-chain and create hash-links which we see as content IDs (CIDs). But what is IPLD, and why is it important in the grander scheme of things? Learning about IPLD will allow a unique insight into how IPFS works and the methods necessary to extend the data structures currently available to users through IPFS.

https://eagereyes.org/blog/2021/paper-from-jam-session-to-recital-synchronous-communication-and-collaboration-around-data-in-organizations  
Who are the people who use data and visualization as part of their work every day? In particular, how do people use data as part of meetings, to present to others, to discuss their findings and recommendations, etc.? My colleague Matt Brehmer and I ran a pair of studies to find out.

**Open-Sourcing a Monitoring GUI for Metaflow, Netflix’s ML Platform**  
https://netflixtechblog.com/open-sourcing-a-monitoring-gui-for-metaflow-75ff465f0d60  
Today, we are open-sourcing a long-awaited GUI for Metaflow. The Metaflow GUI allows data scientists to monitor their workflows in real-time, track experiments, and see detailed logs and results for every executed task. The GUI can be extended with plugins, allowing the community to build integrations to other systems, custom visualizations, and embed upcoming features of Metaflow directly into its views.

**Machine Learning You Can Get Excited About**  
https://atthis.link/blog/2021/mlbore.html  
A few weeks ago an article garnered some attention making the case that 'boring' machine learning is where the industry should be focusing its attention. Boring being defined here as tasks that humans are not innately good at such as analysing vast databases or modelling complex 3D structures. While these topics may not be particularly exciting, the author argues that they offer more value than choosing to work in computer vision and language where "usefulness seems relatively minimal."

**How to Find a Mentor and Get Started in Open Source**  
https://thenewstack.io/how-to-find-a-mentor-and-get-started-in-open-source/  
But the Cloud Native Computing Foundation has more than 138,000 contributors making over 7 million contributions to more than 100 open source projects. It’s reasonable that getting started in open source would feel overwhelming — to say the least. So how do you get started as a contributor to cloud native projects? How do you find a mentor or guide to help you along?

**To Learn a New Language, Read Its Standard Library**  
http://patshaughnessy.net/2021/10/23/to-learn-a-new-language-read-its-standard-library  
The best way to learn a new programming language, just like a human language, is from example. To learn how to write code you first need to read someone else’s code. But who is the best person to learn from? Which code should we read? Where should we look to find it?

**GitHub stale bot considered harmful**  
https://drewdevault.com/2021/10/26/stalebot.html
One of GitHub’s “recommended” marketplace features is the “stale” bot. The purpose of this bot is to automatically close GitHub issues after a period of inactivity, 60 days by default. You have probably encountered it yourself in the course of your work.
This is a terrible, horrible, no good, very bad idea.

**Financial innovation is actually happening**  
https://bam.kalzumeus.com/archive/financial-innovation-is-happening/  
If you say the words “financial innovation” many people incorrectly believe it is largely negative (or at least risk-taking) or not happening. This is incorrect. The world is actually getting better, within our own lifetimes. Much of the improvement has been to under-the-hood infrastructure not paid much attention to by the general public, but since the financial system touches almost every part of our lives, it is worth knowing what has happened and on which axes we can expect further improvement.
