**Helping the Web find its product-market fit**  
https://paulbakaus.com/2021/02/12/helping-the-web-find-its-product-market-fit/  
For all the discussion happening around individual slices of the web in the web developer community – may it be making web apps more feature rich, streamlined payments, smoother scrolling.. I’m starting to wonder if we need to talk more about the big picture. In this case, the big picture is the web as a product, being used by consumers worldwide. How should using the web feel like? What should the experience be like? What is the web we want?

**Organic, Homegrown HTML**

**How we designed and wrote the narrative for our homepage**  
https://github.blog/2021-02-11-how-we-designed-and-wrote-the-narrative-for-our-homepage/  
Developers interact with GitHub in many ways: writing code, maintaining projects, updating dependencies, reviewing pull requests, working on the go, and so much more. Our homepage needed to speak honestly and directly to the many roles developers play while showcasing the real experience of using GitHub. This blog post provides a behind the scenes look at the design, and the process we used to get there. Spoiler alert: we used GitHub heavily.

**GitLab - Interesting things UX is working on - February 2021**  
https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2021/02/12/interesting-things-ux-is-working-on-february-2021/  
Take a look at some of the design work we've got in process. Releated: [Redesigning our docs - Get a sneak peek at the refinements coming to docs.gitlab.com](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2021/02/12/redesigning-our-docs/).

**Five Charts You’ve Never Used but Should**  
https://policyviz.com/2021/02/08/five-charts-youve-never-used-but-should/  
In my new book, Better Data Visualizations: A Guide for Scholars, Researchers, and Wonks, I survey more than eighty visualization types, everything from histograms to horizon charts, ridgeline plots to choropleth maps, and explain how each has its place in the visual toolkit. To get you started, here are five graphs that perhaps you’ve never used before but that you should consider. They either do a better job showing certain types of data or they are more engaging and interesting than basic chart types.

**What Saul Bass Can Teach Us About Web Design**  
https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/02/saul-bass-teach-web-design/  
Film credits, brand logos, posters… Saul Bass did it all, and the principles that informed his work are just as valuable now as they were 50 years ago.

**CSS Animations as a DOM-Based Animations Framework**  
https://medium.com/bbc-design-engineering/css-animations-as-a-dom-based-animations-framework-d6ef582c033a  
This is the second post in a series about how BBC Children’s and Education have migrated from native-first apps to interactive app experiences as Progressive Web Apps (PWA). As we saw in the first blog post, very soon we will be launching four CBeebies apps, completing the migration of old embedded tech to modern web standards and APIs on the new Universal App Platform (UAP). Part of this process has involved creating a new, declarative animations framework and re-thinking how we usƒe them. This blog will be focused on that, but you can read about the strategy and motivation behind the creation of UAP here.

**React is king (and that’s not changing anytime soon)**  
https://www.browserlondon.com/blog/2021/02/09/react-is-king/. 
It seems unstoppable. Many developers, particularly those who’ve been in the industry a long time, have heard this all before, though. Before React, there was Angular and before that, there was jQuery – all frameworks that have fallen by the wayside. It’s just a matter of time before something comes along and takes the mantle as the new hotness. Or so they say. I’m not so sure. In fact, I think React will be with us for many years to come.

**Tiny Programming Principles: The concept of Optionals**  
https://www.tiny.cloud/blog/javascript-optionals/  
Many developers (including our team at Tiny) are now using Optionals (or similar concepts) as a good work around. But not everyone knows about Optionals. So, let’s take a closer look at what issues may come up, why they happen, and how you can use Optionals (or other alternatives) to write more stable, predictable, and usable code.

**Why Flutter is overtaking React Native**  
https://blog.logrocket.com/why-flutter-is-overtaking-react-native/  
Flutter is a complete SDK for building apps and not just a framework. This implies that it includes everything required to build a user interface (UI), including the Material Design and Cupertino widgets. This lets developers easily render the UI on both iOS and Android. Releated: [Flutter Engage 03.03](https://events.flutter.dev/), [1 year in production with Flutter: lessons learned](https://medium.com/mews-devs/1-year-in-production-with-flutter-lessons-learned-5de86723c5df).

**Low-Code Platforms and the Rise of the Community Developer: Lots of Solutions, or Lots of Problems?**  
https://www.infoq.com/articles/low-code-community-developer/  
To help you understand how this trend will impact your IT organization, we discuss the types of low-code platforms available and the type of staff in your organization who will be attracted to them. We then look at how low-code platforms fit into your IT architecture and, finally, provide our views on optimal strategies for managing IT in a low-code world.

**API Design Guidance: Long-Running Background Jobs**  
https://tyk.io/api-design-guidance-long-running-background-jobs/  
The REST style is particularly suited for synchronous APIs, where requests generally return quickly (less than a few seconds). For operations that take a longer time to complete, it may not be optimal for applications to block with an open connection waiting for a response. Let’s look at how we can support long-running background jobs in our REST-based APIs by applying some techniques and design patterns using what is provided to us from the HTTP specification.

**Edge Authentication and Token-Agnostic Identity Propagation**  
https://netflixtechblog.com/edge-authentication-and-token-agnostic-identity-propagation-514e47e0b602  
A few years ago, we decided to address this complexity by spinning up a new initiative, and eventually a new team, to move the complex handling of user and device authentication, and various security protocols and tokens, to the edge of the network, managed by a set of centralized services, and a single team. In the process, we changed end-to-end identity propagation within the network of services to use a cryptographically-verifiable token-agnostic identity object.

**Ruby on Rails Creator Takes on JavaScript Frameworks with Hotwire**  
https://thenewstack.io/ruby-on-rails-creator-takes-on-javascript-frameworks-with-hotwire/  
Ruby on Rails creator David Heinemeier Hansson recently spoke at a virtual meetup of the Chicago Association for Computing Machinery (ACM). Hansson, who has been at the forefront of web development for the past 15 years, talked about the state of JavaScript frameworks today, frontend development trends he’s tracking, and a new framework he helped create, called Hotwire.

**Widely used programming languages: past, present, and future**  
http://shape-of-code.coding-guidelines.com/2021/02/07/widely-used-programming-languages-past-present-and-future/  
Programming languages are like pop groups in that they have followers, fans and supporters; new ones are constantly being created and some eventually become widely popular, while those that were once popular slowly fade away or mutate into something else.

**Good ideas on tool-making from the story of UNIX**  
https://thesephist.com/posts/unix/  
Unlike most systems of the vintage that were commissioned by large companies for commercial uses, UNIX was created out of programmers' desires for a better tool and workspace for programmers like them. And “paradoxically,” as the authors note, this approach resulted in a system that succeeded nearly universally. To conclude the paper, the authors lay out three specific reasons that contributed to the success of UNIX. Reading over them, I thought they held a lot of value as timeless principles for building great tools of all kinds, so I wanted to enumerate and comment on them here in relation to some of my own principles. In the order of their presentation, the three are: 1. Design for makers, 2. Embrace constraints, 3. Self-host and self-modify.

**产品经理的世界观影响他的产品形态**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/zMqwFGT3S0ajepFZlJtHhQ  
产品经理的世界观影响他的产品形态。好的产品经理只能够靠他自己的经历，自我打磨出来，而不是培训出来的。一个人如果真在去发现自我，他的经验会跟别人不一样。在很多时候产品能够做出真正正确的选择，是经过非常长时期的思考得出来的，当然这过程也会看数据，来逐渐验证这个东西。但更重要的是，对于世界应该是怎么样的，他应该有一个非常强大的假设和思辨。伟大产品都是格物致知靠着对这个世界进行强假设和预判出来的。就像乔布斯说的，「消费者并不知道自己需要什么，直到我们拿出自己的产品，他们发现，这就是我要的东西。」另附：[聊聊大厂产品观：从失控到规模](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/5gvW0g10r9m8FjOQnebdnQ)。
