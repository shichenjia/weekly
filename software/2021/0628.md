**React Ruined Web Development**  
https://medium.com/building-productive/react-ruined-web-development-dd65342a833f  
You can try to convince me that React isn’t that bad, and I will absolutely agree with you! 😄 But instead, let’s debate about the more important topics — the work that we actually do as software engineers. Releated: [React 18: A Summary in 12 Tweets](https://twitter.com/ProvablyFlarnie/status/1406729055488016386), [What's NOT new in React 18](https://dev.to/bennypowers/what-s-not-new-in-react-18-45c7), [Seven things you can’t do in React…](https://christianheilmann.com/2021/06/21/seven-things-you-cant-do-in-react/).

**Maybe it’s time we re-think docs**  
https://kathykorevec.medium.com/building-a-better-place-for-docs-197f92765409  
If you think that documentation sites don’t need to be prioritized or that we shouldn’t invest in them, just ask a developer what they need, and then go think again about what you might be missing out on if you don’t have an immersive, interactive and engaging experience for docs. Instead of just making Yet Another Docs Site (YADS), let’s make experiences that stands apart — our developers deserve it.

**业务中的前端组件化体系**  
https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/383129585  
在业务开发过程中，我们总是会期望某些功能一定程度的复用。很基础的那些元素，比如按钮，输入框，它们的使用方式都已经被大部分人熟知，但是一旦某块功能复杂起来，成为一种“业务组件”的时候，就会陷入一些很奇怪的境况，最初是期望抽出来的这块组件能有比较好的复用性，但是，可能当另外一个业务想要复用它的时候，往往遇到很多问题：​不能满足需求；为了满足多个业务的复用需求，不得不把组件修改到很别扭的程度；参数失控；版本无法管理... 诸如此类，时常使人怀疑，在一个业务体系中，组件化到底应该如何去做？​本文试图围绕这个主题，给出一些可能的解决思路。

**The 2021 Software Developer Shortage Is Coming**  
https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2021/7/253461-the-2021-software-developer-shortage-is-coming/fulltext  
While global economies of all scales have been severely impacted by the COVID-19 global pandemic, information technology (IT) companies have managed to survive much of the economic downturn. This is due in large part to their past success in distributed IT development, remote IT operations, and remote maintenance. IT companies have required their staff to essentially do at home what they had been doing in the office years before. Moreover, to meet the constraints of working from home, the demand for IT services has increased across many other market sectors, including retail, entertainment, education, and healthcare, leading to a more profitable IT market.

**读懂类型体操：TypeScript 类型元编程基础入门**  
https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/384172236  
现在，TypeScript 已经在前端圈获得了广泛的群众基础。但据个人观察，很多同学还处于刚刚脱离 AnyScript 的阶段，看到 K in keyof T 这类东西就头疼，读不懂现代前端框架中普遍使用的类型操作技巧。如果你也对类型体操感到一头雾水，本文或许能为你提供一些授人以渔式的帮助。由于本文预期的受众是完全没有高级类型操作经验的同学，因此下面我们不会直接列出一堆复杂的类型体操案例，而是从最简单的泛型变量语法等基础知识开始，逐步展示该如何从零到一地使用 TS 中强大的 type-level 编程能力。另附：[聊一聊 TypeScript 编译器的使用](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/nLG43aDSomGjCS5iIT8Gmg)。

**Sharing React Components across Multiple Applications**  
https://blog.bitsrc.io/sharing-react-components-across-multiple-applications-a407b5a15186  
We have almost all been in a situation where we need to share a component between one app and another. Often we just decide to copy and paste it because it really is the quickest option. And sometimes it’s even ok, especially when it comes to those smaller components. But what if you wanted to share a big and more complex component? 

**HTTP/3 AND QUIC: PAST, PRESENT, AND FUTURE**  
https://blogs.akamai.com/2021/06/http3-and-quic-past-present-and-future.html  
QUIC is a new transport for the internet. The use of QUIC enables deployment of years of research developments at once, improves privacy, and offers substantially better performance in challenging network conditions.  HTTP/3 is the mapping of HTTP which uses IETF QUIC as a transport. I'm the editor of HTTP/3 and an active contributor to the IETF QUIC specs. In this post, I'm going to take a look at where IETF QUIC came from, how far it has progressed, and what's left to do.

**Deep Learning for AI**  
https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2021/7/253464-deep-learning-for-ai/fulltext  
Research on artificial neural networks was motivated by the observation that human intelligence emerges from highly parallel networks of relatively simple, non-linear neurons that learn by adjusting the strengths of their connections. This observation leads to a central computational question: How is it possible for networks of this general kind to learn the complicated internal representations that are required for difficult tasks such as recognizing objects or understanding language?
 
**git undo: We can do better**  
https://blog.waleedkhan.name/git-undo/  
Git is a version control system with robust underlying principles, and yet, novice users are terrified of it. When they make a mistake, many would rather delete and re-clone the repository than try to fix it. Even proficient users can find wading through the reflog tedious. Why? How is it so easy to “lose” your data in a system that’s supposed to never lose your data?

**Introducing the new GitHub Issues**  
https://github.blog/2021-06-23-introducing-new-github-issues/  
As teams and projects grow, the way you work evolves. Tools that hard-code a specific methodology are too rigid and complex to flex to whatever the moment demands. Often, we find ourselves creating a spreadsheet or pulling out a notepad, just to have the freedom to think. But then our planning is disconnected from where the work happens and quickly goes stale. Today, we are announcing new beta features within GitHub Issues to connect your planning directly to the work your teams are doing, and flexibly to adapt to their needs.

**如何从书法篆刻里学设计？让AGI高手何佳兴来教你！**  
https://www.uisdc.com/hejiaxing  
篆刻与书法，这都是我上大学前想都没想过的事情，何佳兴说：其实我大学主修书法与篆刻纯属意外。高中我了解过广告设计，考大学时则想攻读西画，因为西画与设计在感觉上比较贴合。事与愿违，因为分数不够，被分到国画组，但在学习篆隶草行楷等各类字体的过程中，慢慢发现了其中的乐趣所在。书法以线条表现，写字的状态很吸引人，篆刻也是。我觉得艺术创作是可以跨领域互相移植的，我也认为把我学过的书法和当代艺术的逻辑移植到设计上，就会许多交叉运用的可能性。

When was the last time you went a day without using any emoji? How about a week? In March 2021, I went through a fun self-imposed experiment: no emoji for 2 weeks. Not on social media, not in private messages, not even as Slack or Discord reactions. No emoticon either: the goal was to communicate without illustrations, only with words.
