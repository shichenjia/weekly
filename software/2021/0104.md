**Beyond customization: build tools that grow with us**  
https://thesephist.com/posts/ivy/  
When a tool is designed to be simply customizable with an abundance of settings and options, adding power means adding complexity and steepening the learning curve. If great tools are about multiplying our creativity, customization gets in the way of this mission, because it limits how flexible our tools can be, and how easily we can learn to use them. We need a better way to build tools that wrap around our workflows than simply adding levers and dials for every new option.

**Creativity In A World Of Technology: Does It Exist?**  
https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/12/creativity-technology/  
This article investigates the intricate dynamics associated with the relationship between creativity and technology and discussing whether or not creativity still exists. We will explore what creativity looks like and who (or what) is it now coming from. Ultimately, if creativity is truly being impacted by technology, is there a way to find the balance between the human and the digital?

**“无代码”与我们的距离**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/Zhmh6mzCyxJlOvmuDMBSfw  
在数字化程度越来越高的今天，被预设的软件应用场景和被迭代周期限制的功能更新速度已经无法满足一部分用户的诉求。各个领域都开始关注生产力如何实现降本增效的大环境下，“无代码化”提供了一种新的思路。尽管听起来更像是技术范畴的概念，“无代码”趋势实际上是由市场所驱动带来的——这意味着作为研发上游的产品经理和设计师可能比开发人员更需要关注“无代码”趋势对未来产品形态带来的影响。

**Deco 智能代码 · 开启产研效率革命**  
https://aotu.io/notes/2020/12/31/deco/  
对于电商平台来说，每年都需要面临大量的大促活动页面需求，对于如何提高页面产出效率，大家都不约而同采用「页面可视化搭建」解决方案。对应的，我们也构建了「羚珑可视化页面搭建平台」。但近两年大促活动定制化需求井喷，平台有限的组件模块已无法满足产品运营需求，前端工程师也无法再用「复用」的思想简单地解决问题。当业务发展到一定程度，有限的人力以及冗长的开发流程更是无法满足蓬勃发展的业务需求。我们需要「求变」，传统的人力密集型研发无法解决的问题，是否能用智能化的思想来解决呢？顺着这个方向，我们把目标瞄准了「前端智能化」，希望借助 AI 和机器学习的能力拓展前端能力圈，打通设计与研发的工作流程，实现规模化生产。

**写给前端的原生开发基础入门**  
https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/340410273  
作为一名前端开发者，我在过去的一年中都在开发 Hybrid 应用框架（参见我的 QCon Plus 分享）。这个过程中我（不得不）学习了许多与原生应用开发相关的知识。在终于把许多点串起来之后，我发现原生应用与 Web 应用之间其实共享着相似的理念模型，二者间本质上并没有多高的壁垒和门槛。因此我整理出了这篇文章，帮助大家用前端的思维模型去理解原生应用的开发。

**微软承认了在软件测试方面的失误**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/MEe4XAxZJp-4UZudd0DKGQ  
表面上看，每个工程师所做的事情的工作量是原来的两倍或更多，因此特性交付速度会变慢。然而，由于开发团队和测试团队的合并，特性团队的总人数并没有改变。向“合体工程师”的转变无疑需要为每位工程师增加培训和新技能开发方面的投资，但是这些可能能过减少交接成本和新的测试实践所带来的效率提高所抵消。自实施这种转型以来，我们已经看到了特性交付速度上，持续且且相当显着的增长

**API pagination design**  
https://solovyov.net/blog/2020/api-pagination-design/  
Returning all results for a given query could be a challenge for an API, especially if there are thousands of results. It puts a load on a server, on a client, on a network, and often is unnecessary. Thus people invented pagination. Releated: [API Design Guidance: Workflows](https://tyk.io/api-design-guidance-workflows/).

**Is RPA dead in 2021? Not until enterprises transform their apps**  
https://research.aimultiple.com/is-rpa-dead/  
RPA, one of the fastest growing enterprise solutions, itself will not become obsolete, at least in the next few years. RPA installations could need to be replaced if more custom solutions with better error rates become available. However, as RPA installations are replaced, there will be need to automate other processes for which a domain specific solution may not exist.

**2020 year in review: Connectivity innovations, faster apps, and progress toward net zero**  
https://engineering.fb.com/2020/12/30/connectivity/2020-year-in-review/  
Whether it was finding new and innovative ways to expand internet connectivity, releasing new tools for engineers and developers, or lowering our greenhouse gas emissions and staying on track toward achieving 100 percent renewable power, we’re pleased to have made great progress on essential work at such a difficult time. Here’s a look back at some of our biggest stories from 2020.

**State machines are wonderful tools**  
https://nullprogram.com/blog/2020/12/31/  
State machines are perhaps one of those concepts you heard about in college but never put into practice. Maybe you use them regularly. Regardless, you certainly run into them regularly, from regular expressions to traffic lights.

**The Mu Computer in 2020**  
http://akkartik.name/post/mu-2020  
For several years now I've had a vision for a computer that allows anyone to audit its inner workings, where any operation can be decomposed strictly into a parsimonious combination of simpler operations, terminating without cyclic dependencies or circular reasoning at some ground level. Ideally it would do this in a way that rewards curiosity, leading to a virtuous cycle where an order of magnitude more people grow to understand how their computer works as they use it.

Flow is a novel browser, built from the ground up, that is designed for modern computer architectures. It uses all the available CPU cores for page layout, so different elements of the page are laid out concurrently. Flow also draws HTML elements directly on the GPU, dramatically improving rendering performance and keeping the CPU free for faster JavaScript execution.

**Announcing the GitHub Education Classroom Report 2020**  
https://github.blog/2020-12-30-announcing-the-github-education-classroom-report-2020/  
For the fourth year in a row, the GitHub Education team surveyed students and educators to provide faculty with information to support augmented instruction and share key insights from other instructors. GitHub Education helps students, teachers, schools, and partners access the resources they need to shape the next generation of developers. This is particularly important as technical education continues to evolve.

**SaaS we happily pay for**  
https://francescodilorenzo.com/saas-we-pay-for  
We try to run a lean operation at Mailbrew, but we are suckers for great tools that improve our daily workflows, so we pay for quite a few of them each month. Being small (just 3 people), the cost of switching services is almost negligible, so we try new stuff regularly and do switch when we see a clear improvement.

**Product/Culture Duality**

At many startups, culture happens organically. It’s just built around the personalities and values of the founders and early team. But anyone who has built a company before learns a pretty vital lesson: culture is important, and when something is that important you have to be intentional about it.
