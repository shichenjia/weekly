**Have Single-Page Apps 'Ruined' the Web?**  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=860d8usGC0o  
https://css-tricks.com/have-single-page-apps-ruined-the-web-transitional-apps/  
The backlash to modern front end development is gaining steam, with good reason: single-page apps have ruined the web. Can we rescue it without going backwards? In this talk, Rich Harris presents a way to do just that. Rich Harris is a graphics editor at the New York Times, where he builds JavaScript apps to help explain the news. He is also the creator of Rollup, the JavaScript module bundler, and Svelte, the front end framework.

**说说「反混沌」：Future.js**  
https://ourai.ws/posts/futurejs-from-anti-chaos/  
相信看到「Future.js」这个名字，会想起前些日子某厂连续开源的好几个前端相关项目之一的「Modern.js」——没错！就像「Fxxk Design」一样，这个名字也是受「启发」而起的，也是把一些正在建设中与规划要做的项目进行了「概念包装」。从目前的了解来看，Modern.js 是要建设「大而全」的体系和打造「事实标准」。这种目标我是支持的，但反对由商业组织牵头，尤其是国内的，应该由非盈利个人/组织发起并牵头主导与社区共建——不会出现 KPI 开源等情况。「大而全」的体系和打造「事实标准」是相辅相成的，一个「大而全」的体系和一系列「事实标准」可以让当前混乱的 Web 前端变得更加有序，让技术深耕技术，令业务专注业务——这也是「反混沌」要做的事情。

**Curves and Surfaces**  
https://ciechanow.ski/curves-and-surfaces/  
Throughout this article I’ll keep jumping back and forth between curves and surfaces to highlight how the ideas we develop for wiggly lines can be expanded onto three dimensional shells that we can shape.

**A Comprehensive Guide To Error Handling In Node.js**  
https://www.honeybadger.io/blog/errors-nodejs/  
Errors happen in every application. Devs have to decide: do you write code to handle the error? Suppress it? Notify the user? Report it to the team? In this article, Ayo Isaiah walks us through every aspect of the JavaScript error system. He'll show us how to work with errors and discuss appropriate choices for real-world scenarios

**The Future of Kidtech: A Web Browser for the Under-10 Set**  
https://future.a16z.com/web-browser-for-kids/  
But accepting this constrained view of “kidtech” — games and shows, ad infinitum — is a missed opportunity for young children. Granting kids safe, instant access to the vast trove of information that exists online is a challenge worth exploring. I believe there’s room for a new audio-visual web browser for kids: one where they can independently look things up online and satisfy their own curiosity. And just as browsers have grown in importance for adults (they’re basically an OS), they hold the same promise for children. The biggest hurdle to tackling this issue of accessibility, however, isn’t technological — it’s philosophical and cultural.

**A Quick Intro to Elm for React Developers**  
https://blog.theodo.com/2021/10/intro-to-elm-for-react-devs/  
Elm is probably my favourite programming language - its opinionated but welcoming design provides a compelling case study in how language design can gently guide developers towards writing maintainable code.

**Developer Tools secrets that shouldn’t be secrets**  
https://christianheilmann.com/2021/11/01/developer-tools-secrets-that-shouldnt-be-secrets/  
This is a talk that I’ve given at CityJS this September. I am a principal product manager for developer tools in Microsoft Edge and these are things I encountered during working on the tools, documenting them and going through user feedback.

**Compliance in a DevOps Culture**  
https://martinfowler.com/articles/devops-compliance.html  
Integrating the necessary Security Controls and Audit capabilities to satisfy Compliance requirements within a DevOps culture can capitalize on CI/CD pipeline automation, but presents unique challenges as an organization scales. Understanding the second order implications and unintended consequences caused by the chosen implementation is key to building an effective, secure, and scalable solution.

**Avoiding bot detection: How to scrape the web without getting blocked?**  
https://github.com/niespodd/browser-fingerprinting  
Anti-bot solutions have evolved in recent years. More and more websites are introducing security measures: from simple ones, such as filtering IP addresses according to their geolocation, to advanced ones based on in-depth analysis of browser parameters and behavioral analysis. All this makes web scraping content more difficult and costly than a few years ago. Nevertheless, it is still possible. Here I highlight a few tips that you may find helpful.

**An opinionated guide on how to reverse engineer software**  
https://margin.re/media/an-opinionated-guide-on-how-to-reverse-engineer-software-part-1.aspx  
This is the first post in a series meant to help improve your static reverse engineering skills. The target audience are folks who have dipped their toes into reverse engineering but found themselves feeling lost. This is an opinionated guide. After 12 years of reverse engineering professionally, I have developed strong beliefs on how to get good at RE.

**Netflix Video Quality at Scale with Cosmos Microservices**  
https://netflixtechblog.com/netflix-video-quality-at-scale-with-cosmos-microservices-552be631c113  
Measuring video quality at scale is an essential component of the Netflix streaming pipeline. Perceptual quality measurements are used to drive video encoding optimizations, perform video codec comparisons, carry out A/B testing and optimize streaming QoE decisions to mention a few. In particular, the VMAF metric lies at the core of improving the Netflix member’s streaming video quality. It has become a de facto standard for perceptual quality measurements within Netflix and, thanks to its open-source nature, throughout the video industry.

**Bash functions are better than I thought**  
https://cuddly-octo-palm-tree.com/posts/2021-10-31-better-bash-functions/  
I've been using Bash functions quite liberally over the past couple years, but last week I discovered that they can be much better than I thought. In this post, I'll explain how I thought they worked, why I was wrong, and how that makes them better.

**A developer’s guide to programatically overcome fear of failure**  
https://www.pagerduty.com/blog/engineers-guide-on-the-importance-of-failure/  
People are more than happy to talk about their successes, but if you ask them about their failures, they can be much more hesitant to share. Failure is a subject that, interestingly enough, is entangled with the emotion of shame. Yet it’s integral to achieving anything novel, and the learnings that come from failure are unparalleled. So, let’s find ways to get more comfortable with failing, and figure out why people fear it.

**The Value Of Concept Testing As Part Of Product Design**  
https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/11/concept-testing-part-of-product-design/  
Concept testing ideas before moving into a detailed design is good UX practice. In this article, Victor Yocco presents details on how and when to engage in concept testing, as well as case studies providing details on the insights gained in two very different settings.

**用户体验，是不是被吹过头了？**  
https://www.uisdc.com/user-experience-analysis  
自从 UI 行业越来越饱和，体验设计就被捧得越来越高。甚至就连隔壁的产品经理、运营、技术……也经常跑来帮忙站一站台子。但是作为一个「用户体验」领域的博主，我一直怀疑这个词是不是被吹过头了。虽然顶着大厂设计师、人机交互海归、行业协会专家等标签，我在跟很多互联网企业家/创业者/管理者交流的时候，感觉他们其实并没有多重视「用户体验」。

**Why The Status Quo Is So Hard To Change In Engineering Teams**  
https://www.okayhq.com/blog/status-quo-is-so-hard-to-change-in-engineering-teams  
While this example focuses on the developer experience, learned helplessness also presents a paradoxical challenge to engineering managers: here is a situation where a manager should be deeply concerned about their team’s well-being, engagement and ultimately retention, but the symptoms are invisible. Their reports won’t tell the manager that they are having a terrible on-call experience - they might even reject any attempt to improve the situation at first, because fixing the problem feels unusual.

**Why is Excalidraw so fucking good?**  
https://offbyone.us/posts/why-is-excalidraw-so-good/  
Once I picked up Excalidraw, I haven't put it down. It became my tool-of-choice for diagrams, wireframes, brainstorms, and more. Part of why it was such a good fit for me is that it filled a massive hole in my toolkit. Before the pandemic, I would frequently sketch on whiteboards with my coworkers. In high school, I had a small classroom-sized whiteboard in my bedroom. The pandemic hit me like a ton of bricks in all sorts of ways. At work, one of the hardest parts was losing the white board. Of course, I could get a personal whiteboard, but then I wouldn't be able to really use it for work.
So what is it about this software? Why does it work so well?
