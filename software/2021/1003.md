**Gamification: a Strategy for Enterprises to Enable Digital Product Practices**  
https://www.infoq.com/articles/gamification-digital-product-practices/  
We are entering a new decade with a sense of urgency to rebuild the world economic landscape. As we have been living through the pandemic, we collectively realized that the business ecosystem radically shifted and next-generation products are steering us all forward. The next-generation products reflect association with the changing lifestyle and value ecosystem of consumers. To embrace the changing needs of consumers,  organizations are exploring new ways to ideate, collaborate and create products,  some of them being embracing co-creation models, investment in long-term value, and fostering collective wisdom through gamification. This article is focused on gamification and how it helps to create perspective around product practices which bring us closer to the next-generation products.

**why is everything so hard in a large organization?**  
https://graphthinking.blogspot.com/2021/09/why-is-everything-so-hard-in-large.html  
You're a member of a team that is part of a large organization. Welcome! This post is intended to help you navigate your environment. If you're fresh out of school, or if you haven't worked in a large organization before, you may not have experienced the difficulties that naturally arise when cooperating with other humans to carry out complex multi-participant tasks.

**Web3 — A vision for a decentralized web**  
https://blog.cloudflare.com/what-is-web3/  
For many developers, the term Web3 feels like a buzzword — it's the sort of thing you see on a popular "Things you need to learn in 2021" tweet. As a software developer, I've spent years feeling the same way. In the last few months, I’ve taken a closer look at the Web3 ecosystem, to better understand how it works, and why it matters.

**Doing Software Estimation within constraints of Hofstadter’s law and Parkinson’s law**  
https://shekhargulati.com/2021/09/23/doing-software-estimation-within-constraints-of-hofstadters-law-and-parkinsons-law/  
In this post, I covered my process of doing software estimation. Software estimations are hard to get right. To improve your estimates you have to relook at your past estimates and understand the delta between your estimates and actual effort. Also, you need to consider it takes time to create an effective team. They will not be productive on day 1. You will need to keep the first month or so for the team to reach an optimum level of productivity. Keep in mind that it will never be 100%. The best you can target is 60%. This is one way that projects start out behind schedule from the very beginning, if the schedule assumes steady-state productivity right from the start.

**How We Build Micro Frontends With Lattice**  
https://netflixtechblog.com/how-we-build-micro-frontends-with-lattice-22b8635f77ea  
We needed to consolidate these tools in a way that scaled with the teams we served. It needed to have the agility of a micro frontend and the extensibility of a framework to empower our stakeholders to extend our tools. We would abstract parts of which anyone can then customize, or extend, to meet their specific business or technical requirements. The end result is Lattice: RGT’s pluggable framework for micro frontends.

本篇文章所言都是针对静态场景的，在这种实现下，物体和相机都不能移动，这在实际的应用中显然是不够的。一般在真正可用的实现中，我们必须引入Motion Vector，来计算当前一个像素上一帧所对应的像素，然后分别存储权重，最终达到动态场景的滤波。但这也会引入更多其他的问题，由于篇幅和时间确实没空完成了。

**The Rise of GraphQL Databases**  
https://dgraph.io/blog/post/rise-of-gql-db/  
This new approach to storing data and building APIs is bringing a new wave of development forward. Will it completely obliterate the paradigms of the past? It’s unlikely. But it does give developers a choice, much like SQL vs NoSQL, to build apps the way we want. There are always many ways to solve a problem but usually only a few that solve it efficiently. For complex problems with data storage, retrieval, and APIs that have struggled with the current technology stacks, GraphQL and graph databases offer an alternative solution with the ideal balance of efficiency and simplicity.

**Why we ditched DynamoDB**  
https://usefathom.com/blog/ditched-dynamodb  
I can’t believe I’ve written this article but, after being very publicly excited about DynamoDB for over a year and building up a huge mailing list around our plans to put our entire database into DynamoDB, we’ve now completely ditched it. DynamoDB started off as a technology that would change our world, but it ended up being a massive roadblock to us being able to price competitively at scale for our web analytics. In this post, I will talk through how we arrived at DynamoDB’s doorstep and why we then burned the whole house to the ground.

**Open-sourcing Mariana Trench: Analyzing Android and Java app security in depth**  
https://engineering.fb.com/2021/09/29/security/mariana-trench/  
We built MT to focus particularly on Android applications. There are differences in patching and ensuring the adoption of code updates between mobile and web applications, so they require different approaches. While server-side code can be updated almost instantaneously for web apps, mitigating a security bug in an Android application relies on each user updating the application on the device they own in a timely way. This makes it that much more important for any app developer to put systems in place to help prevent vulnerabilities from making it into mobile releases, whenever possible.

**A New Design-Centered Meeting Framework: Better Capture the Product Design Narrative**  
https://uxmag.com/articles/a-new-design-centered-meeting-framework-better-capture-the-product-design-narrative  
As New York Public Radio, like many other organizations, have shifted to working remotely over the last year, we saw a need to rethink how we collaborate in order to increase productivity. Like many design teams before COVID-19, we already used tools like Figma and Miro that made passive or asynchronous communication possible but once we removed the in-person aspect, a few things changed.

**Try PayPal’s ‘Conscious Design Canvas’ to build more inclusive products**  
https://www.invisionapp.com/inside-design/paypal-ben-evans-picture-the-future/  
Though we practice “human-centered design,” we rarely question which humans we center in our designs, says Ben Evans, PayPal’s director of product inclusion. Humans tend towards exclusion to prevent information overload. However, a creative brain can override this ingrained bias if you engage with curiosity and ask the right questions, Ben says.

It exists on so many zoom levels — in space (nation, state, electoral districts), but also in time: We know the election results from the past 70 years, we get new polls daily in the months before an election, and on election night, TV hosts inform us about the latest extrapolated results every hour or so.For this week's Weekly Chart, I tried to show all the different time scales in a single time series.

**When users never use the features they asked for**  
https://web.eecs.utk.edu/~azh/blog/featurestheywanted.html  
t is well-known in user research that if you ask a user if they want a new feature, that they will often scream, "YES". Why wouldn't someone want more features after all? Although they may not actually use it. And you may not know that until after it is released. This is a story of a time I built exactly what developers told me they wanted, and then they didn't use it. But this time it isn't that simple. I had a lot of evidence showing the need for these features. So why weren't they using it?!
