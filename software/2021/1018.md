**Practical frontend philosophy**  
https://jaredgorski.org/writing/15-practical-frontend-philosophy/  
Frontend cannot be exempt from the rigor and sobriety of good software making. After all, frontend is software. "Frontend" really just means "software which supports an interface", and interfaces convey data. There are plenty of interfaces throughout a software system, including on the backend. Zoomed out, the frontend is just a data pipeline, conveying data from computers to humans. Releated: [A Philosophy of Software Design](https://toranbillups.com/blog/archive/2021/10/05/philosophy-of-software-design/).

**Is Deno Still a Thing? A Look at the Status of the 'Node Killer'**  
https://blog.bitsrc.io/is-deno-still-a-thing-a-look-at-the-status-of-the-node-killer-884d47981d09  
It’s been well over a year already, what have they been up to?

**The 10x Programmer Myth**  
https://www.simplethread.com/the-10x-programmer-myth/  
10x programmers might exist, but not in the way most people think. There are a few behaviors of engineers, when mixed with a little creative storytelling, that has led us to create the myth of the 10x programmer.

**What if… you could use Visual Studio Code as the editor of in-browser Developer Tools?**  
https://christianheilmann.com/2021/10/12/what-if-you-could-use-visual-studio-code-as-the-editor-of-in-browser-developer-tools/  
Starting with the next version of Microsoft Edge, we are running an experiment that allows you to use Visual Studio Code as the editor of the in-browser Developer Tools. Here’s a three minute video explaining why we think this is a good idea. Releated: [Introducing Sapling, A VS Code Extension For Traversing Your React Component Hierarchy](https://medium.com/@saplingextension/introducing-sapling-a-vs-code-extension-for-traversing-your-react-component-hierarchy-3ac94d95887e).  

**Software developers have stopped caring about reliability**  
https://drewdevault.com/2021/10/17/Reliability.html  
Finally, stop letting economics decide everything you do. Yes, developers have finite time, and that time costs. Yes, users with annoying needs like accessibility and internationalization are more expensive to support than the returns they produce. You need to pay for it anyway. It’s the right thing to do. We can be profitable and empathetic. Don’t think about rushing to market first, and instead prioritize getting a good product into your user’s hands. Our users are not cattle. It is not our job to convert attention into money at their expense. We need to treat users with respect, and that means testing our goddamn code before we ship it.

**The Autofill Dark Pattern**  
https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/10/autofill-dark-pattern/  
A “dark pattern” is a deceptive UX pattern that tricks users into doing things they may not really want to do. In this article, Alvaro Montoro does a little experiment to find out how much privacy is taken away from users across three different browsers.

**Web API Design Anti-Pattern: Exposing your database model**  
https://shekhargulati.com/2021/10/15/web-api-design-anti-pattern-exposing-your-database-model/  
We can do a much better job at Web API design by following contract first model of API design. API Styles like GraphQL enforce contract first API design so they can help avoid this anti-pattern. I know with GraphQL there are tools that allow you to generate GraphQL APIs from the database schema. I prefer to avoid such tools. But, if you have to use such tools then I recommend writing a transformation layer in front of them. This will protect you from leaking your database model to the consumers.

**How to win at CORS**  
https://jakearchibald.com/2021/cors/  
CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is hard. It's hard because it's part of how browsers fetch stuff, and that's a set of behaviours that started with the very first web browser over thirty years ago. Since then, it's been a constant source of development; adding features, improving defaults, and papering over past mistakes without breaking too much of the web.

**Web Fonts vs SVG. Which One Should You Use? Well, It Depends**  
https://blog.fontawesome.com/webfont-vs-svg/  
There are lots of classic rivalries. Today we’ll chat about Font Awesome’s two main implementations — web fonts vs SVG. (And we provide a handy dandy scorecard at the end of the blog to help you tally up what’s best for you.)

**聊聊写书、技术会议、知名度和变现**  
https://www.dongwm.com/post/talk-about-writebook-and-something/  
我在早期的工作环境里慢慢的总结出了让自己变优秀的几个因素，其中包含能力和判断力。也就是说在不断提高技术品味的过程中，还要能洞悉技术和业务的本质，所以对于各种技术和相关领域的事物都要有自己的观察力和判断力。闲来无事，写一篇关于写书、演讲、做网红以及技术变现等相关的内容。这里面有我这几年对这些内容的观察、理解和经验，希望对大家能有一点启发。

**Web browsing in the OS of the future**  
https://alexanderobenauer.com/weekly/20211012/  
There’s a lab note I’ve had in the works for some time now on web browsing in the OS of the future. A concept I prototyped allowed users to browse the “static web” without javascript (and some other things). If a user wanted to allow javascript on a page or domain, they could enable the URL as an “app,” causing the system to treat it as such, both in its behavior and how you might navigate to it.

**Decentralized Applications with Slate**  
https://blog.ipfs.io/developing-consumer-decentralized-applications-with-textile-slate/  
Slate (opens new window)is an open-source version of file storage that allows users to upload their files to the Filecoin network, download other users' files, and ensure accessibility from anywhere on the web. It runs on Textile buckets to interact with IPFS so it can leverage content addressing and other features of that network. 

**Who Pays for Web Frameworks**  
https://www.zachleat.com/web/monetization/  
I don’t have the answers. I definitely wouldn’t agree that Eleventy has figured out our sustainable monetization strategy but I do really admire the success that Vue has had solving this exact problem. I do know that I have no interest in Trend 2 but I’ll continue to keep a keen eye on what other indie-framework folks are doing.

**Open Source Is Finally Coming to Financial Services**  
https://future.a16z.com/open-source-financial-services/  
Open source will catalyze the financial services industry’s biggest evolution to date. This evolution will shift the power in this $25 trillion industry from business executives to developers, not just in fintech companies, but in centuries-old incumbents, as well.  

**Understanding Python through its builtins**  
https://sadh.life/post/builtins/  
Python as a language is comparatively simple. And I believe, that you can learn quite a lot about Python and its features, just by learning what all of its builtins are, and what they do. And to back up that claim, I’ll be doing just that. Releated: [A viable solution for Python concurrency](https://lwn.net/SubscriberLink/872869/0e62bba2db51ec7a/).

**Revisiting BetterTLS: Certificate Path Building**  
https://netflixtechblog.com/revisiting-bettertls-certificate-path-building-4c978b79843f  
Last year the AddTrust root certificate expired and lots of clients had a bad time. Some Roku devices weren’t working right, Heroku had problems, and some folks couldn’t even curl. In the aftermath Ryan Sleevi wrote a really great blog post not just about the issue of this one certificate’s expiry, but the problem that so many TLS implementations have in general with certificate path building. If you haven’t read that blog post, you should. This post is probably going to make a lot more sense if you’ve read that one first, so go ahead and read it now.

**Improving HDFS I/O Utilization for Efficiency**  
https://eng.uber.com/improving-hdfs-i-o-utilization-for-efficiency/  
Scaling our data infrastructure with lower hardware costs while maintaining high performance and service reliability has been no easy feat. To accommodate the exponential growth in both Data Storage and Analytics Compute at Uber, the Data Infrastructure team massively overhauled its approach in scaling the Apache Hadoop® Data File System (HDFS) by re-architecting the software layer in conjunction with a hardware redesign:

**Efficient Resource Management at Pinterest’s Batch Processing Platform**  
https://medium.com/pinterest-engineering/efficient-resource-management-at-pinterests-batch-processing-platform-61512ad98a95  
Pinterest’s Batch Processing Platform, Monarch, runs most of the batch processing workflows of the company. At the scale shown in Table 1, it is important to manage the platform resources to provide quality of service (QoS) while achieving cost efficiency. This article shares how we do that and future work.

**Updates and Lessons from AI Forecasting**  
https://bair.berkeley.edu/blog/2021/10/14/forecasting/  
Depending on who you are, you might have any of several questions: What the heck is a professional forecaster? Has this sort of thing been done before? What do the forecasts say? Why did we choose these questions? What lessons did we learn? You’re in luck, because I’m going to answer each of these in the following sections! Feel free to skim to the ones that interest you the most.

**Microsoft Translator: Now translating 100 languages and counting!**

https://blog.prototypr.io/prototyping-101-minimum-viable-effort-fcb400e7bb12  
TL;DR — for a prototype designer it’s a valuable trait to not polish work beyond the threshold of “good enough”. Prototyping is a series of steps towards a larger destination, and wasted time on an individual “step” makes it less likely that you will ever reach your destination.

**Our focused, audacious approach to fighting for the web we want**  
https://webfoundation.org/2021/10/our-focused-audacious-approach-to-fighting-for-the-web-we-want/  
Over the past decade, we’ve successfully fought to shape the policies and products we need for the web we want. This has been achieved through original research, advocacy and public action, and working with civil society, technology companies, and governments, whose decisions and actions shape our digital world. We’ve realised that if we are to move our mission forward, our organisation must dedicate our full attention to the areas where we can make the biggest difference. Our new five-year strategy — summarised here — sets out a focused approach to fighting for the web we want.
