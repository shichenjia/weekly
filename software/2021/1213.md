**Professional maintainers: a wake-up call**  
https://blog.filippo.io/professional-maintainers/  
I work on the Go team at Google, but this is my personal opinion as someone who built a career on Open Source both at and outside big companies. Open Source software runs the Internet, and by extension the economy. This is an undisputed fact about reality in 2021. And yet, the role of Open Source maintainer has failed to mature from a hobby into a proper profession.

**Scaling the Practice of Architecture, Conversationally**  
https://martinfowler.com/articles/scaling-architecture-conversationally.html  
Architecture need not be a monologue; delivered top-down from the minds and mouths of a centralised few. This article describes another way to do architecture; as a series of conversations, driven by a decentralised and empowering decision-making technique, and supported by four learning and alignment mechanisms: Decision Records, Advisory Forum, Team-sourced Principles, and a Technology Radar

**Log4Shell: RCE 0-day exploit found in log4j 2, a popular Java logging package**  
https://www.lunasec.io/docs/blog/log4j-zero-day/  
A few hours ago, a 0-day exploit in the popular Java logging library log4j (version 2) was discovered that results in Remote Code Execution (RCE) by logging a certain string. Given how ubiquitous this library is, the impact of the exploit (full server control), and how easy it is to exploit, the impact of this vulnerability is quite severe. We're calling it "Log4Shell" for short. The 0-day was tweeted along with a POC posted on GitHub. Since this vulnerability is still very new, there isn't a CVE to track it yet. This has been published as CVE-2021-44228. This post provides resources to help you understand the vulnerability and how to mitigate it for yourself.

**Defensive CSS**  
https://ishadeed.com/article/defensive-css/  
Oftentimes, we wish that there was a way to avoid a certain CSS issue or behaviors from happening. You know, content is dynamic, and things can change on a web page, thus increasing the possibility of a CSS issue or a weird behavior. Defensive CSS is a collection of snippets that can help you in writing CSS that is protected. In other words, you will have fewer issues in the future. If you follow my blog, you might read an article I wrote a while back which is called “The just in case mindset”. This is built upon it, and will be an ongoing list of snippets. If you have any suggestions, please feel free to let me know about it.

**Breaking Out of the Box**  
https://alistapart.com/article/breaking-out-of-the-box/  
CSS is about styling boxes. In fact, the whole web is made of boxes, from the browser viewport to elements on a page. But every once in a while a new feature comes along that makes us rethink our design approach.

**Cubic Bézier: from math to motion**  
https://blog.maximeheckel.com/posts/cubic-bezier-from-math-to-motion  
So, I went down a rabbit hole of math, animations, and code to have a clear understanding of what cubic-bezier really is, and also what the numbers I passed to that function meant and how they translate to motion. Hence the title of this blog post! We'll first deep dive into the math behind cubic-bezier, then try to visualize how the graphical representation of this function translates into motion and how it relates to other timing functions you might be familiar with. All of that, illustrated through interactive visualizations to allow you to see and tweak the math that's behind these beautiful transitions ⭐️.

**Why you should check-in your node dependencies**  
https://www.jackfranklin.co.uk/blog/check-in-your-node-dependencies/  
I currently work at Google on the Chrome DevTools team and we check our node_modules folder into source control. At first this struck me as unusual, but I've come to believe that there are some major benefits to this approach that I think more people should consider.

**Fighting TLS fingerprinting with Node.js**  
https://httptoolkit.tech/blog/tls-fingerprinting-node-js/  
The modern internet is full of services that want to know who you are. Fingerprinting is the latest way to do this: capturing many small details about your client, and using it to create an id that's sufficiently unique to recognize you and infer details about your network client and device.

**One decade later: Minecraft world generation is finally interesting again**  
https://dither8.xyz/blog/minecraft-cliffs-terrain/  
I was quite a big fan of Minecraft when I started playing it in early-2011. I have stopped in recent years since I find it dangerously addictive, though I sometimes keep up with the new changes. Today I want to look back at a development mistake that was made in Beta 1.8, one that took a decade to recover from. In the b1.8 update, the terrain generator was subject to a rewrite aimed to make the code simpler, and make the terrain more realistic. This was back in September 2011, the game was nowhere near as popular as it is today, only a small portion of today's players even know about it. But at the time it caused quite a controversy, a thread on the Minecraft Forums decried the new terrain as "boring", and quickly became the most replied topic on the site.

**How programming affects your brain**  
https://ckeditor.com/blog/how-programming-affects-your-brain/  
Learning programming as well as tackling complex software development issues you may encounter later on are both very beneficial for the mind. When logic meets creativity, and language - math skills, and this is often the case of software developers, this mix can bring great results - regarding both the quality of problem-solving and the programmer’s brain itself.

**Chrome Users Beware: Manifest V3 is Deceitful and Threatening**  
https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/12/chrome-users-beware-manifest-v3-deceitful-and-threatening  
Manifest V3, or Mv3 for short, is outright harmful to privacy efforts. It will restrict the capabilities of web extensions—especially those that are designed to monitor, modify, and compute alongside the conversation your browser has with the websites you visit. Under the new specifications, extensions like these– like some privacy-protective tracker blockers– will have greatly reduced capabilities. Google’s efforts to limit that access is concerning, especially considering that Google has trackers installed on 75% of the top one million websites. Releated: [uBlock and other AdBlocks in Chrome will lose most functionality in about a month when Manifestv3 is implemented](https://old.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/rdaz50/ysk_ublock_and_other_adblocks_in_chrome_will_lose/).

Today, she serves as our VP of content design and has had a key role in our pivot to Meta. Here, Elisabeth talks with us about her career, content design’s role at Meta, its evolution, and more.

**The metaverse: a bold, exciting digital future or a digital dystopia like we’ve never seen before?**  
https://webfoundation.org/2021/12/the-metaverse-a-bold-exciting-digital-future-or-a-digital-dystopia-like-weve-never-seen-before/  
If the metaverse really is to be the next generation of the web, we need serious commitment and action now to ensure it is built to prioritise the rights, safety, and wellbeing of everyone. Here are four key areas to consider: Protecting privacy, Preventing abuse, Ensuring interoperability, Enabling access.

So, will big tech’s dominance be permanent or transitory, self-stabilizing or self-defeating? Here is one way to think about this: imagine that one day, a new kind of magic is discovered.

**产品经理该如何思考（道哥的产品课）**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/Qfo0UsHY6LNbrMxTJ6FtbQ  
1.产品经理最重要的能力叫做定义的能力，究其本质是一种对市场的洞察能力，然后衍生出一个定位的能力。2.产品经理五件事（三定义两关注）：定义市场、定义机会、定义产品形态、关注客户体验、关注客户心智。3.产品和商品的区别：提供了使用价值的叫产品，提供了交易价值的叫商品。商品交易的规模越大、交易的频率越快，这个商品的价值就会越高，或者说它的估值就会越高。4.从产品到商品，要关注定价、营销和运营，并建立渠道。5. 当技术有稀缺性的时候，它会是一个竞争力，当技术没有稀缺性的时候，它就是一个工作量。

**效率是创新的敌人**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/4E7vGQHkXcwqxPPQIYdrPw  
效率，追求最短路径。创新，需要适度浪费。记住，效率是创新的敌人。如果你想保持创新活力，可以试试适度浪费，不挤出最后一滴水。那效率是不是就不重要了？不，效率当然重要。创新，造就阶段性领先；效率，成就持续性领先。“效率”和“创新”虽然对立，但你可以同时拥有这两种思维。不同的阶段，学会运用不同的能力，建立竞争优势。

**真正大格局的人：不解释，不纠缠，不责备**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/Bz4FPg6wixt-EpfCRaoyEA  
作家何权峰曾说：“气度变大，抱怨就变少；胸襟变宽，路就变广；格局够大，问题就消失不见。”人生的很多问题，其实不是来自外界，而是来自内心。格局小的人，容易在琐碎的小事中沉沦。格局大的人，不解释，不纠缠，不责备。自在沉静，豁达从容。

**金一南重磅演讲：拼到极致，国运就来了！**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/awIPpB78QrhaA-nU4z87GQ  
我对运的理解是，一个国家、一个民族和一个个人一样，当努力达到极致的时候，运就出现了。运，不是说躺在床上等天上掉馅饼。只有当你拼命地努力、拼命地奋斗，每每当你努力到了极致的时候，不知道怎么回事，芝麻开门了，运来了。对个人、对国家、对民族都是如此，我们在这个过程中共同努力，最终实现我们所有中国人的共同目标，就是中华民族的伟复兴。我们努力到极致，运就出现了。
