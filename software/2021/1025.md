Web browsers are ubiquitous, but how do they work? This book explains, building a basic but complete web browser, from networking to JavaScript, in a thousand lines of Python.

**HTML with Superpowers**  
https://daverupert.com/2021/10/html-with-superpowers/  
I think if you were using Web Components before 2020 you were an early adopter and you probably have some scars to show for it. But in 2021, now that all modern browsers support Web Components, I think they’re worth investigating. They have one superpower that no other JavaScript framework offers called the Shadow DOM which is both powerful but frustrating. But another superpower — the power I’m most excited about — is that you can use them standalone without any frameworks, build tools, or package managers.

**An Interview With Elad Shechter on “The New CSS Reset”**  
https://css-tricks.com/an-interview-with-elad-shechter-on-the-new-css-reset/  
Hey folks! Elad reached out to me to show me his new CSS reset project called the-new-css-reset. It’s quite interesting! I thought a neat way to share it with you is not only to point you toward it, but to ask Elad some questions about it for your reading pleasure.

**We Analyzed 425,909 Favicons**  
https://iconmap.io/blog  
The humble favicon was messily birthed with the pernicious IE5 release. Since that fateful day, browsers have slowly expanded favicon technology to encompass many wildly differing and lightly documented use cases. Here in 2021 favicons are found primarily in browser tabs, home screens, and Google search results, but they continue to pop up in the strangest places.

**React & TypeScript: how to type hooks (a complete guide)**  
https://devtrium.com/posts/react-typescript-how-to-type-hooks  
Using hooks is one of the most common things you do when writing React applications. If you use TypeScript in your apps, knowing how to type hooks properly is very important (and if you don't use TypeScript, you should seriously think about it!). In this article we'll go over how to type each usual hook React provides us.

**136 facts every web dev should know before they burn out and turn to landscape painting or nude modelling**  
https://www.baldurbjarnason.com/2021/100-things-every-web-developer-should-know/  
Everything I’ve learned about web development in the almost twenty-five years I’ve been practising. All boiled down into a neat little list that I put together over a week. I’m Icelandic, so I’m prone to absolute statements. It’s a cultural thing. No, I’m not going to explain any of these.

**Code quality: a concern for businesses, bottom lines, and empathetic programmers**  
https://stackoverflow.blog/2021/10/18/code-quality-a-concern-for-businesses-bottom-lines-and-empathetic-programmers/  
Code quality affects the mentals state of a programmer, communication within their team, and the incentives attached to their work. Improve your code and you can improve your organizational health and competence as a whole.

**Autonomous testing of services at scale**  
https://engineering.fb.com/2021/10/20/developer-tools/autonomous-testing/  
We are detailing a new autonomous testing extension that we’ve built on top of this integration testing infrastructure, as well as a behind-the-scenes look at the infrastructure itself. This extension borrows ideas from fuzz testing, an automated technique that uses random inputs to find bugs, and leverages the homogeneity of our software stack to provide a seamless developer experience and encourage quick iterations. 

**The Myth of Self-Documenting Code**  
https://buttondown.email/hillelwayne/archive/the-myth-of-self-documenting-code/  
One of the first things you learn as a teacher is that most “obvious” things aren’t. No matter how simple and obvious something is to you, it isn’t simple or obvious for anybody else. This applies to programming, too. When you write “self-documenting code”, it’s self-documenting to you. But you have all this internal context that makes it self-documenting. Other people don’t have that context. They need more information than your code has.

**You should be ready, willing, and able to read the source code of your dependencies**  
https://changelog.com/posts/read-the-source-code-of-your-dependencies  
If you have a library dependency that your application relies upon, and you’re afraid to (or for whatever reason will not) peek under the covers and grok its source code… you should not be using that piece of software. You should be ready, willing, and able to read the source code of your dependencies.

**The future of code search - with Quinn Slack, CEO of Sourcegraph**  
https://changelog.com/founderstalk/81  
The future of code search has never been more clear and we’re excited to share today’s show with you.

**Struggling with Machine Learning? You’re Not Alone** 
https://algorithmia.com/blog/struggling-with-machine-learning-youre-not-alone  
Today’s organizations are up against a great machine learning paradox. Most are investing more than ever in artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML), but far too few have implemented ML models or realized the business impact that AI/ML promises. With businesses pouring resources into AI and machine learning, why are results still so elusive? DataRobot dove deep into the AI/ML strategies of over 400 organizations across industries to find out.

**What is a product backlog and how does it work?**  
https://www.browserlondon.com/blog/2021/10/20/what-is-a-product-backlog-and-how-does-it-work/  
An important element of any agile development project is the backlog. Most people who’ve worked on or near a software project will know vaguely what a ‘backlog’ is (the phrase, ‘add it to the backlog’ is a common refrain), but when pushed for a definition, answers may vary.

**When Less Becomes More For Large Product Teams**  
https://spin.atomicobject.com/2021/10/24/small-teams/  
Atomic is a fan of smaller teams. In our experience, small teams outperform large teams on projects. Small teams have a high degree of ownership when doing important work. This allows them to have a deep connection to what they are doing and to care about what they deliver. Time is the most valuable resource, and small teams work hard to hit tight deadlines.

**7 eCommerce Design Trends You Need to Know for 2022**  
https://tympanus.net/codrops/2021/10/20/7-ecommerce-design-trends-you-need-to-know-for-2022/  
As ecommerce’s popularity grows, web designers need to know how to design online stores that can compete. Mastering these 7 ecommerce design trends is a good place to start.

**We’ve upgraded the UI in Visual Studio 2022**  
https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/weve-upgraded-the-ui-in-visual-studio-2022/  
In Visual Studio 2022, our team made a series of targeted investments to upgrade the Visual Studio user interface. We’re committed to spending time on the things that have meaningful impact to your product experience, so we grounded our work in real problems and suggestions surfaced by you and made sure to work with you every step of the way to ensure we got it right. The resulting refresh, we’re proud to say, supports improved wayfinding and visual cohesion, more intuitive and legible (yet still familiar!) iconography, improved accessibility, and the start of some customization options that let you make Visual Studio your own.

**Thoughts on Design (Systems)**  
https://medium.design/thoughts-on-design-systems-599a76ae740a  
The product design team at Medium has been working on updating our design system, our guide for how we build Medium. I’ve been thinking about different approaches to design systems, specifically how to balance consistency with flexibility. There’s a certain beauty to a rigid system like Are.na — a seldom changing, expected design that feels familiar and utilitarian. There’s room for expressiveness or excitement but no real need for it. The lack of iteration within the system has become a part of the brand’s charm and identity.

**RSS is Wonderful**  
https://quakkels.com/posts/rss-is-wonderful/  
I think the ideal online community is decentralized and free from secret proprietary algorithms. Blogs, RSS, and tools like RSS Discovery Engine help cultivate such communities. RSS Discovery Engine is pre-alpha software. It has a while to go to iron out all the wrinkles and deliver as much transparent and decentralized functionality as it can.

**Leaving Google**  
https://jayconrod.com/posts/122/leaving-google  
Last Friday was my last day at Google. Of course, when you leave Google you have to write some kind of letter or rant. Seriously it's a rule: they won't remove your neural implant until you hit publish. Jokes aside, this is more of a memoir than a polemic. Of course I have opinions, but now's not the time. This is more about reflecting on the last seven years of my life, thinking about what was important and what I'll do differently in the future.

**Forget Twitter Threads; Write A Blog Post Instead!**

All of the kool kids in Twitter land seem to be jumping on the bandwagon of a very annoying craze. Twitter threads. Please stop; write a blog post instead.

**你的目标层级，决定了你的最终结局**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/xbxa_dtRzcGkyhyP73cevQ  
凡事都有三个目标，最高目标，中间目标，和最低目标。所以我们通常的做法应该是：心中装有最高目标，然后努力。也许天有不测风云，你只得到了中间的状态，但无论如何都不能低于底线目标。如果你心中没有装备这个目标，却得到了最好的结果。你应该明白，那是运气撒了谎，且运气不会始终降临在你身上。如果遇到意外，以底线目标为目标的话，你面临的，将是失败。

-- THE END --
