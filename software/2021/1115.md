Today we’re introducing Interface Designer: our new offering to create complete and customized applications with Airtable. Releated: [What do you think about the no-code movement?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29188355).

**Platform Teams**  
https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/platform-teams/  
Platform teams are the building blocks that product teams use to ship business-facing functionality. Products are built on top of platforms, which platforms enable product teams to move faster. Platform teams are key in scaling up high-growth engineering organizations. If you don’t create platform teams in time, you fail to stay ahead of the growth curve. When you don’t create any platform teams, the incentive for the product engineering teams is to build the next product feature. 

**‘Play-to-Earn’ Gaming and How Work is Evolving in Web3**  
https://future.a16z.com/podcasts/play-to-earn-gaming-and-how-work-is-evolving-in-web3/  
The top play-to-earn game is called [Axie Infinity](https://axieinfinity.com/), operated by a Vietnam-based company called Sky Mavis. Players of the game acquire unique digital pets called Axies, and battle other teams of Axies. These NFT Axies can be created and sold using the game’s in-game currency, SLP, which can be traded for traditional currency. Think of it as Pokemon on the blockchain, with a social network built-in, and an actual economy, and even companies built around the game that help players onboard and loan them money to get started playing. Releated: [Web3 is not decentralization](https://invisibleup.com//articles/38/).  

**Chrome Dev Summit: It’s a Web Evolution, Not Revolution**  
https://thenewstack.io/chrome-dev-summit-2021-its-a-web-evolution-not-revolution/  
This year’s Chrome Dev Summit, held virtually by Google, was a relatively muted event compared to the 2020 version. Last December, Google told us the web platform was fast catching up with native applications, that Chrome extensions were “a superpower for the web,” and that PWAs (progressive web apps) were “on the cusp” of a “transformational moment.”

**The inception of ESLint**  
https://eslint.org/blog/2021/11/the-inception-of-eslint  
If you're like me, you probably use a lot of open source tools every day without thinking about how they got started. Few projects share the "why" of their creation: the actual problem they were trying to solve and when they first came across that problem. You can, of course, benefit from open source projects without understanding their origin story, but I always find it interesting to hear about how it all started.

**Building a 3D game menu component**  
https://web.dev/building-a-3d-game-menu-component/  
In this post I want to share thinking on a way to build a 3D game menu component.

**The Invisible JavaScript Backdoor**  
https://certitude.consulting/blog/en/invisible-backdoor/  
Just as we were finishing up this blog post, a team at the University of Cambridge released a paper describing such an attack. Their approach, however, is quite different from ours – it focuses on the Unicode bidirectional mechanism (Bidi). We have implemented a different take on what the paper titles “Invisible Character Attacks” and “Homoglyph Attacks“.

**Why I Love Remix**  
https://kentcdodds.com/blog/why-i-love-remix  
kentcdodds.com is completely custom built by me (and team) using Remix. After writing tens of thousands of lines of code using this framework, I have developed a great appreciation for what this framework can do for me and the users of my site. I want to tell you about some of it.

**Etsy’s Journey to TypeScript**  
https://codeascraft.com/2021/11/08/etsys-journey-to-typescript/  
This post is all about how we designed our approach, some of the fun technical challenges that resulted, and what it took to educate an Etsy-sized company in a new programming language.
 
**Speed up your TypeScript monorepo with esbuild**  
https://mmazzarolo.com/blog/2021-11-06-speed-up-your-typescript-monorepo-with-esbuild/  
TypeScript monorepos are a great way to organize medium-to-big size projects. TypeScript improves the developer experience by adding type-checking and a deep IDE integration. And using a monorepo helps in scaling your project(s).
 
**Meet Hydrogen: A React Framework For Dynamic, Contextual And Personalized E-Commerce**  
https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/11/hydrogen-react-framework-dynamic-contextual-personalized-ecommerce/  
A great commerce experience cannot be distilled to a single number. It’s not a Lighthouse score, or a set of Core Web Vitals figures, although both are important inputs. A great commerce experience is a trilemma that carefully balances competing needs of delivering a great customer experience, dynamic storefront capabilities, and long-term business — conversion, retention, re-engagement — objectives.

**Browser Wars**  
https://css-tricks.com/chapter-10-browser-wars/  
In June of 1995, representatives from Microsoft arrived at the Netscape offices. The stated goal was to find ways to work together—Netscape as the single dominant force in the browser market and Microsoft as a tech giant just beginning to consider the implications of the Internet. Both groups, however, were suspicious of ulterior motives.

**Make your monorepo feel small with Git’s sparse index**  
https://github.blog/2021-11-10-make-your-monorepo-feel-small-with-gits-sparse-index/  
Throughout the past year, the Git Fundamentals team at GitHub contributed a new feature to Git called the sparse index, which allows the index to focus on the files within the sparse-checkout cone.  Today, I will go deep into the design and implementation of the sparse index. In particular, I’ll focus on how the Git community made such a significant change to a critical data structure in a safe way. I will include links to the actual changes in the Git codebase as I go.

**From informal to formal modeling**  
https://modeling-languages.com/from-informal-to-formal-modeling/  
Any software model should be consistent and correct at some point in the development process. And there are many tools for this, including our preferred approach.  But this doesn’t mean all models should be correct from the very beginning. More the opposite, in early stages of the development process we may want to let the models go loose to facilitate the exploration of design alternatives without having to worry about creating perfect models all the time.

**The strong and weak forces of architecture**  
https://martinfowler.com/articles/strong-weak-arch.html  
Good technical design decisions are very dependent on context. Teams that regularly work together on common goals are able to communicate regularly and negotiate changes quickly. These teams exhibit a strong force of alignment, and can make technology and design decisions that harness that strong force. As we zoom out in a larger organisation an increasingly weak force exists between teams and divisions that work independently and have less frequent collaboration. Recognising the differences in these strong and weak forces allows us to make better decisions and give better guidance for each level, allowing for more empowered teams that can move faster.

**The curl v8 plan**  
https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2021/11/11/the-curl-v8-plan/  
Given that, a curl version 8.0.0 is inevitably going to have to happen and since we do releases every 8 weeks and we basically bump the version number in just about every release, there is a limited amount of time left to avoid the minor number to reach 100. We just shipped curl 7.80.0, so we have less than 20 release cycles in the worst case; a few years. Releated: [My first 25 years of HTTP](https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2021/11/11/my-first-25-years-of-http/), [16000 curl commmits](https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2021/11/12/16000-curl-commmits/).

**Documentation could be so much better**  
https://buttondown.email/hillelwayne/archive/documentation-could-be-so-much-better/  
Documentation is bound to our idea of text, in particular physical text. A book is a single static thing, it cannot change to fit the needs of the user. Hypertext is a step beyond that: we can link references and ctrl-F. Past that we… stop. We write the documentation as if it’s just a bunch of unstructured text with hyperlinks in it. Any markup is just there for formatting. We wrap code in ```codeblocks``` in order to highlight and monospace something, not because the text should “know” it’s a codeblock.

**How To Make A CPU - A Simple Picture Based Explanation**  
https://blog.robertelder.org/how-to-make-a-cpu/  
The purpose of this article is to explain how to make a CPU out of rocks and sand as fast as possible without using too many words.  As the world of proprietary hardware and software crushes in around us, we risk losing the ability to make things for ourselves as individuals.  It is for this reason that I felt compelled to learn how one could hypothetically make their own integrated circuits by themself.  Skip to the end of this article for a few more words on this subject and a disclaimer.

**Microsoft and the Metaverse**  
https://stratechery.com/2021/microsoft-and-the-metaverse/  
It’s certainly the question of the season: what is the Metaverse? I detailed the origin of the term in August; that, though, was about Neal Stephenson’s vision and how it might apply to the future. For the purpose of this Article I am going to focus on my personal definition of the Metaverse, how I think it will come to market, and explain why I think Microsoft is so well placed for this opportunity.
