**"Open Source" is Broken**

https://nadh.in/blog/open-source-is-not-broken/  
If you want me to make you useful software, pay me. If you use software made by others in their spare time and find it useful, pay them. This should not be a controversial opinion. This should not be a new thing. This should already be the state of the world and it is amazingly horrible for us to have the people that make the things that make our software work at all starve and beg for donations.

**Embrace the Platform**  
https://css-tricks.com/embrace-the-platform/  
It has been almost 25 years since Berners-Lee published that article. Yet, somehow, the message he sent didn’t get through, and many developers — but not all — are unaware of it. 

**React Conf 2021 Recap**  
https://reactjs.org/blog/2021/12/17/react-conf-2021-recap.html  
Last week we hosted our 6th React Conf. In previous years, we’ve used the React Conf stage to deliver industry changing announcements such as React Native and React Hooks. This year, we shared our multi-platform vision for React, starting with the release of React 18 and gradual adoption of concurrent features.

**The State of CSS 2021**  
https://2021.stateofcss.com/en-US/  
https://web.dev/state-of-css-2021/  
Do woodworkers have to learn a new, better way to saw a board every couple years? Do painters feel like frauds for still using oil paint? Or is it just us front-end developers who get to experience this constant state of change? ... What this means in practice is that we can now cross-reference two datapoints, such as yearly salaries by experience level; or gender by country. You'll see some of these breakdowns included throughout the results, but we encourage you to explore the data further using our API or by downloading our data. Let us know if you end up making your own data visualizations! And now, let's see what CSS has been up to this year!

**Don’t Start With Microservices – Monoliths Are Your Friend**  
https://arnoldgalovics.com/microservices-in-production/  
I’ve been having this thought on the back of my mind for a long time to write about why it’s often a bad idea to start with microservices for a brand new project. The time has come, that’s exactly what I’ll talk about in this article.

**What is a user interface?**  
https://blog.airtable.com/user-interface/  
A century ago, the exciting new interface was the rotary dial on a telephone. A lightswitch is an interface, as is a microphone, an abacus, and an ATM screen. Today when we talk about interfaces, we usually mean portals to another realm—the digital one. The interface is the way we command or interact with a vast range of digital experiences.

**Working With Web Feeds: It’s More Than RSS**  
https://css-tricks.com/working-with-web-feeds-its-more-than-rss/

**How to build large-scale end-to-end encrypted group video calls**  
https://signal.org/blog/how-to-build-encrypted-group-calls/  
Signal released end-to-end encrypted group calls a year ago, and since then we’ve scaled from support for 5 participants all the way to 40. There is no off the shelf software that would allow us to support calls of that size while ensuring that all communication is end-to-end encrypted, so we built our own open source Signal Calling Service to do the job. This post will describe how it works in more detail.

**How to Write Shell Scripts in Node with Google’s zx Library**

Ankit is working as a Machine Learning Lead/Sr. Machine Learning Engineer at Amazon and has led several machine-learning initiatives across the Amazon ecosystem. Ankit has been working on applying machine learning to solve ambiguous business problems and improve customer experience. For instance, he created a platform for experimenting with different hypotheses on Amazon product pages using reinforcement learning techniques. Currently, he is in the Alexa Shopping organization where he is developing machine-learning-based solutions to send personalized reorder hints to customers for improving their experience.

**SLICK: Adopting SLOs for improved reliability**  
https://engineering.fb.com/2021/12/13/production-engineering/slick/  
Before SLICK, SLOs and other performance metrics were stored in custom dashboards, documents, or other tools. If you wanted to locate a team’s SLOs, it could take an hour of searching or asking people to find something. In addition, our previous systems didn’t retain these metrics at full granularity for more than a few weeks. This made it nearly impossible to analyze an SLO over longer periods of time.

**Launching Version 13.0 of Wolfram Language + Mathematica**  
https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/12/launching-version-13-0-of-wolfram-language-mathematica/  
In Version 1.0 there were a total of 554 functions altogether. Yet between Version 12.0 and Version 13.0 we’ve now added a total of 635 new functions (in addition to the 702 functions that have been updated and upgraded). And it’s actually even more impressive than that. Because when we add a function today the expectations are so much higher than in 1988—because there’s so much more automation we can do, and so much more in the whole system that we have to connect to and integrate with. And, of course, today we can and do write perhaps a hundred times more extensive and detailed documentation than would have ever fit in the (printed) Mathematica Book of 1988.

**Some thoughts on writing**  
https://danluu.com/writing-non-advice/  
I see a lot of essays framed as writing advice which are actually thinly veiled descriptions of how someone writes that basically say "you should write how I write", e.g., people who write short posts say that you should write short posts. As with technical topics, I think a lot of different things can work and what's really important is that you find a style that's suitable to you and the context you operate in. Copying what's worked for someone else is unlikely to work for you, making "write how I write" bad advice. We'll start by looking at how much variety there's been in what's worked1 for people, come back to what makes it so hard to copy someone else's style, and then discuss what I try to do in my writing.

**Uncomfortable Truths in Software Engineering**

**一个小VC眼中的好公司**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/OYjN41sp1r5MHuAq92A77Q  
最近跟一个行业内的投资前辈交流，他说一笔好的投资应该不分阶段（当然在你预算充足的情况下）；你需要花足够长的时间来了解行业，了解公司，然后在“好公司”上不断下重注。所以赚钱的核心逻辑是：选出好赛道，在相对确定性的种子选手身上下重注；只要赛道和选手是对的，那么任何阶段都可能获得3年10倍回报。再回到本文的主题，好公司其实是一个很主观的概念，更何况任何一个公司都不是完美的。在漫长的职业生涯里，投资人一直在反复论证的一个核心问题就是：究竟什么样的公司是好公司？ 读万卷书，还要行万里路；随着阅历的增长，每年我们自身对于好公司的理解都会不同，这就需要不断记录和复盘，从过往经历中找到一些通用的法则。

**分拆Office数十年后，40亿美金的ClickUp重新整合生产力工具**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/6qwwoES_5ufjubKfJA4Y-Q  
我们可以把 Clickup 的发布速度和 Asana做个对比—— Asana 拥有更多工程师和资源，但 2020 年一共发布了 67 项新功能和新集成，是 ClickUp 的 1/3。为了实现这种迭代速度，Zeb Evans 采取了一系列（有争议的）方法：  
1、技术债是扯淡。（Tech Debt，通常指开发人员采用短期内能加速开发的方案，而在未来给自己带来额外的开发负担。）有 Product-Market-Fit 的公司没有一个是不能规模扩张的，大多数 SaaS 公司更大的问题反而是迭代速度不够快。如果验证了 Product-Market-Fit，永远可以先发布再完善。  
2、分离 HTML 和 CSS 职能。写 Javascript 的工程师不应该同时写 HTML 和 CSS（HTML 和 CSS 侧重页面布局，Java 侧重和后端的交互），他们不应该致力于像素级还原设计稿。这种小改变能让整个团队更开心，对工程师来说是双赢。  
3、早期不要投入自动化测试（程序测试程序）。当前端快速迭代时，现实情况是你将花大量时间来修复测试用例的问题而不是产品本身。维护自动化测试反而会占据太多资源。  
4、寻找 5x 工程师。每个人都在谈论 10x 工程师，但是寻找基数更多的5x 工程师。能够一天完成一周工作的工程师就值得被雇佣。  
5、工作与生活不存在平衡。只雇佣那些痴迷于他们所做的事情并喜欢解决问题的人。如果你的整个公司比市场上其他公司更努力工作10%，那么从长远来看，这将有助于您击败竞争对手。  
6、用户会原谅你。非常小的 bug 和产品缺陷是可以接受的，从第一天起“发布看看会发生什么”就是 ClickUp 核心理念的一部分。
在构建一个 All-In-One 的生产力工具时，Zeb Evans 的产品理念与早期的 Facebook 十分相似：“完成比完美更重要”。
