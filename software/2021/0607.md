**Why we need to stop using React**  
https://sredmond.medium.com/why-we-need-to-stop-using-react-1ae3ec7959a4  
Before we even get started I can already hear you pounding away at your keyboards writing your angry response. I would ask that you read my full explanation before going off at me in the comments. I really want to emphasize that I’m not trying to attack you personally because you use React or like React. However, what I am trying to say is that I think that React leaves a lot to be desired. What I want to do is explore the pain points and detail why I think React is an overall flawed library.

**Making JavaScript run fast on WebAssembly**  
https://bytecodealliance.org/articles/making-javascript-run-fast-on-webassembly  
JavaScript in the browser runs many times faster than it did two decades ago. And that happened because the browser vendors spent that time working on intensive performance optimizations. Today, we’re starting work on optimizing JavaScript performance for entirely different environments, where different rules apply. And this is possible because of WebAssembly.

**程序员们，请不要看低零代码**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/yQTsReWsfA7NDKbsHj8aQA  
有外部人士好心给我们建议将产品定位名称修改为“低代码”，而不要那么决绝地叫“零代码”。因为叫低代码，好歹不会让程序员群体过于反感，感觉自己至少还有用武之地。事实上，明道云也包含若干低代码模块，允许部分高级用户使用脚本语言来简化配置步骤，使用API来进行对接开发，这些都离不开训练有素的程序员。但这不是重点，我们想要达成的目标，是让现役程序员做点真正有价值的活，而把那些重复性的开发工作完全削减。称为“零代码”，的确包含一些市场宣言的意图成分。另附：[程序员为什么不喜欢低代码](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/377234404)，[云凤蝶低代码之路](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/uWLwjJ-fjDL2BR2i7aebVw).

Testing is one of those things that you either get super excited about or kinda close your eyes and walk away. Whichever camp you fall into, I’m here to tell you that front-end testing is for everyone. In fact, there are many types of tests and perhaps that is where some of the initial fear or confusion comes from.

A complex infrastructure introduces hidden responsibilities that introduce risk, slowdowns, and frustration. Depending on the infrastructure we choose, we may also inadvertently add server configuration, release management, and other DevOps duties to a front-end developer’s plate. Software architecture has a direct impact on team productivity. Choose tools that avoid hidden complexity to help your teams accomplish more and feel less overloaded.

Today, we are excited to share an exploratory visualization site: Open Source Insights, which provides an interactive view of the dependencies of open source projects.

The shifting realities of a pandemic world mean we’ve had to rethink what it means to be together as a community. This backdrop finds the emerging Web Monetization community in a curious spot: established enough to be a "thing" but still growing and evolving.

WWDC is not just a place for Apple to show off its latest creations, it’s also a place for the Apple community to assemble in person. It’s a special place, a special time of year for many of us. We get to see a glimpse of the future and more importantly, participate in building it. Every WWDC has its moments, but there are some moments in particular that are impossible to forget. From earthshaking announcements to retrospectively goofy quotes, there are so many memories that bring a smile to our faces. As we approach WWDC 2021, let’s take a look back at some of those moments.
