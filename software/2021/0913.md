**Things To Do Before And After You Write Code**  
https://somehowmanage.com/2021/09/05/things-to-do-before-and-after-you-write-code/  
The most effective engineers I’ve worked with were effective not just because of how they wrote code, but because of things they did when they were not writing code. Here’s my (growing) short list of things you should do before or after you write code.

**Decision Making at Netflix**  
https://netflixtechblog.com/decision-making-at-netflix-33065fa06481  
At Netflix, we believe there’s a better way to make decisions about how to improve the experience we deliver to our members: we use A/B tests. Experimentation scales. Instead of small groups of executives or experts contributing to a decision, experimentation gives all our members the opportunity to vote, with their actions, on how to continue to evolve their joyful Netflix experience.

**Why React is Overhyped**  
https://sredmond.medium.com/why-react-is-overhyped-37ac16102d98  
I’ve talked about React in the past, and I’m bringing it back up again. React's popularity is an issue I’ve brought up with several other points, but I want to focus on the overhyped nature of React specifically. I want to talk about how React got to be overhyped, what keeps it that way, and why that’s such a bad thing. Ultimately, React’s inflated popularity is hurting a lot of front-end developers and companies using it.

**Why did the web take over desktop and not mobile?**  
https://subconscious.substack.com/p/why-did-the-web-take-over-desktop  
“make the web do apps” is not a disruptive strategy. It's like surviving The Great Oxidation Event, then saying “make anaerobes do photosynthesis”. Ok, but the blue-green algae got there first, so photosynthesis is no longer asymmetric.

**Using the cloud to solve the world's hardest problems.**  
https://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2021/09/using-aws-to-solve-the-world-hardest-problems.html  
I’ve talked about it before, but 2021 is a special year for technology. It’s the 15-year anniversary of Amazon Web Services, which all started with a simple object storage solution, Amazon S3. When I reflect back on these past 15 years, I’m incredibly proud of the change we spurred already, and it’s amazing to see how cloud continues to transform the world. In the latest episode of AWS’s Fix This podcast, I share the ways our technology has changed, how our customers’ mindsets have shifted, what I’ve learned from builders around the world, and what inspires me about the work our customers do every day.

**Writing Well-Documented Code - Learn from Examples**  
https://codecatalog.org/2021/09/04/well-documented-code.html  
The reason we started Code Catalog is because we believe that we can improve our coding skills by reading good code written by others. Commenting code is no exception. So let’s look at a few examples of good code with helpful comments.

**I See the Next Phase of Enterprise Application Delivery**  
https://medium.com/codex/ive-seen-the-next-phase-of-enterprise-application-delivery-d3ad62ad09e3  
For the last 4–5 years we have all learned a lot about containers. Technologists have embraced their portability, inherent security benefits, and best of all the really cool abilities to spin up, tear down, and scale that container orchestration brings. What could possibly be better than this?

**一个由 Node.js vm 引发的 OOM 血案**  
https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/409355573  
大家在用 Node.js 的 vm 时，可千万小心。冷不丁就哪里埋了坑。有时候补了这里可能又漏了那里。尤其是频繁新建 vm 的时候，例如来一个请求，组合一段代码，放进 vm 中执行。

**如何做一个有质量的技术分享**  
https://coolshell.cn/articles/21589.html  
分享信息并不难，大多数人都能做到，就算是不善言谈性格内向的技术人员，通过博客或社交媒体，或是不正式的交流，他们都能或多或少的做到。但是如果你想要做一个有质量有高度的分享，这个就难了，所谓的有质量和有高度，我心里面的定义有两点：1）分享内容的保鲜期是很长的，2）会被大范围的传递。我们团队内每周都在做技术分享，虽然分享的主题都很有价值，但是分享的质量参差不齐，所以，想写下这篇文章 。供大家参考。

**《C 语言入门教程》发布了**  
http://www.ruanyifeng.com/blog/2021/09/c-language-tutorial.html  
我上一次学习 C 语言，还是在学校里。印象中，C 语言不容易，复杂类型很难声明和解读。但是，这一次重新学习，意外觉得 C 语言并不复杂，语法点少，没有类，只能使用命令式编程（imperative programming），跟脚本语言（比如 JavaScript）相比，语法描述要容易很多。加上网上很少 C 语言中文教程，质量也不理想，于是就萌生了自己写教程的念头。 最初的想法是，在我的学习笔记基础上，加一些示例就可以了。但是真的动手以后，发现工作量很大，尤其是后来决定 C 语言标准库也包括在教程中。C 的语法点虽然不多，但完整的教程至少要20几章，而且 C 代码写法太自由，不少疑难之处还要去查看参考书籍。所以写得很慢，从春节后到现在，整整写了六个多月，终于写完了

**Observability is key to the future of software (and your DevOps career)**  
https://stackoverflow.blog/2021/09/08/observability-is-key-to-the-future-of-software-and-your-devops-career/  
Observability platforms enable you to easily figure out what’s happening with every request and to identify the cause of issues fast. Learning the principles of observability and OpenTelemetry will set you apart from the crowd and provide you with a skill set that will be in increasing demand as more companies perform cloud migrations.

**How WhatsApp is enabling end-to-end encrypted backups**  
https://engineering.fb.com/2021/09/10/security/whatsapp-e2ee-backups/  
For years, in order to safeguard the privacy of people’s messages, WhatsApp has provided end-to-end encryption by default ​​so messages can be seen only by the sender and recipient, and no one in between. Now, we’re planning to give people the option to protect their WhatsApp backups using end-to-end encryption as well.

**Pinterest Home Feed Unified Lightweight Scoring: A Two-tower Approach**  
https://medium.com/pinterest-engineering/pinterest-home-feed-unified-lightweight-scoring-a-two-tower-approach-b3143ac70b55  
Pinterest is a place where users (Pinners) can save and discover content from both web and mobile platforms, and where increasingly Creators can publish native content right to Pinterest. We hold billions of content (Pins) in our corpus and serve personalized recommendations that inspire Pinners to create a life they love. One of the key and most complicated surfaces for Pinterest is the home feed, where Pinners will see personalized feeds based on their engagement and interests. In this blog, we will discuss how we unify our light-weight scoring layer across the various candidate generators that power home feed recommendations.


**SQL vs NoSQL databases**  
https://circleci.com/blog/SQL-vs-NoSQL-databases/  
NoSQL databases, or non-relational databases, have gained popularity and widespread adoption in the past decade. One of the most widely used NoSQL databases, MongoDB, ranked fifth on DB-Engines’ list and was the highest ranked of the four non-relational databases included in the top 10. So what are the differences between SQL and NoSQL, and which database should you use for your next application? In this article, we will explore the pros and cons of each.

Dear open source and libre software developers, I would like to share thoughts with you. This could be considered as an open letter but I'm not sure to know what an open letter is, and I don't want to give instructions to anyone. I have feelings I want to share about my beloved hobby: computers and open source.

Here’s a story. Let’s say you start as a designer working at a software company. Your team moves fast. You get scrappy and learn by shipping features to production. You’re seeing what sticks, what the customers love. Soon, you need to revamp a previous idea. You look back at your early work and realize that it’s janky. It doesn’t fit with the rest of the product. It feels like an idea, like a beta, rather than a polished experience. You worry about its quality.
