**软件幻灭**  
https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/100662403  
我们今天所在的地方是糟糕的。作为工程师，我们有能力也应该做得更好。我们应该有更好的工具，我们应该构建更好的应用，更快，更可预测，更可靠，资源消耗更低（低几个数量级！）。我们应该深入理解我们在做什么以及为什么要做。我们可靠、可预测、最高质量的交付。我们有能力也应该为我们的工作感到自豪。我们不应该只是“交付我们已有的。。。“，没有但是！Releated: [Surprisingly Slow](https://gregoryszorc.com/blog/2021/04/06/surprisingly-slow/), [I can only think that modern front end development has failed](https://twitter.com/antirez/status/1378272801522597888) 及相关讨论： https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26689239 

**语义化表达 —— 构建类型优先的交互体系**  
https://www.yuque.com/xufei-coder/code/fhoks9  
近几年，随着 TypeScript 的逐步流行，类型系统逐渐被前端这个群体重视起来，也逐渐在一些组件库中被深度采用。但是，我们可以发现，如果从使用类型系统的几个层级去划分：类型不友好，类型友好，类型优先。几乎所有组件库都处于前两个层级，并未达到类型优先的程度。那么，什么是类型优先，它有什么好处，本文尝试结合一些具体案例，给出说明。

**The Healing Power of JavaScript**  
https://www.wired.com/story/healing-power-javascript-code-programming/

**Experiment with AR and VR made for the web**  
https://blog.google/products/google-ar-vr/webxr-experiments/  
We’re launching the new WebXR collection to showcase what is possible with this technology — from helpful utilities to get things done, to playful and immersive experiences.

**US Supreme Court Sides with Developers in Google v. Oracle**  
https://github.blog/2021-04-06-supreme-court-sides-with-developers-in-google-v-oracle/  
Google v. Oracle has been a case running for over a decade based around Oracle’s claim that Google violated its copyright in reproducing the Java API in Android. The Supreme Court has finally sided 6-2 in Google’s favor and is reassuring for anyone developing software to be compatible with someone else’s API. CNBC’s coverage has more detail, or you can dig into the [Supreme Court’s 62-page judgment PDF](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/20pdf/18-956_d18f.pdf) to really pick it over.

**实践之后，我们来谈谈如何做好威胁建模**  
https://tech.meituan.com/2021/04/08/threat-modeling-security.html  
威胁建模数十年来不断取得大家的认可，在业内也有STRIDE、Trike、OCTAVE等多种方法论实践。安全行业的从业人员普遍认识到，在研发团队的安全例行活动中，对于一些拥有重要数据资产、安全事件影响力大的系统除了要进行常规的渗透测试、黑白盒代码扫描之外，更应该系统地定期开展威胁建模活动并对业务赋能。对美团安全团队来说，引入领先的安全技术设计能力，构建全方位、多维度智能防御体系，是我们不懈追求的目标。美团有众多基础设施，核心业务系统也需要以成熟的方法论进行威胁评审。本文将着重分享威胁建模是如何帮助美团安全团队评估、发现大量安全设计的风险，以及在互联网企业，应该如何大范围地实施威胁建模并完整地进行落地。

**Eliminating Data Races in Firefox – A Technical Report**  
https://hacks.mozilla.org/2021/04/eliminating-data-races-in-firefox-a-technical-report/  
We successfully deployed ThreadSanitizer in the Firefox project to eliminate data races in our remaining C/C++ components. In the process, we found several impactful bugs and can safely say that data races are often underestimated in terms of their impact on program correctness. We recommend that all multithreaded C/C++ projects adopt the ThreadSanitizer tool to enhance code quality.

**Understanding monorepos**  
https://ionicframework.com/blog/understanding-monorepos/  
So what makes a monorepo so interesting for organizations? Why would they want to put all their code in one place and maintain what could be a massive git repo instead of having many small and separate repositories? Well we at Ionic have a lot of experience with monorepos and wanted to provide some guidance for how Ionic users could implement a monorepo setup for their teams. Let’s dive in.

**How to make an awesome Python package in 2021**  
https://antonz.org/python-packaging/  
If you are like me, you might be thinking that creating packages is a real headache. Well, that’s not the case anymore. And I am going to prove it with this step-by-step guide.

**Go is a great programming language**  
https://drewdevault.com/2021/04/02/Go-is-a-great-language.html  
No software is perfect, and thus even for software I find very pleasant, I can usually identify some problems in it — often using my blog to do so. Even my all-time favorite software project, Plan 9, has some painful flaws! For some projects, it may be my fondness for them that drives me to criticise them even more, in the hope that they’ll live up to the level of respect I feel for them.

**Monster Mash: A Sketch-Based Tool for Casual 3D Modeling and Animation**  
https://ai.googleblog.com/2021/04/monster-mash-sketch-based-tool-for.html  
In this post, we describe Monster Mash, an open source tool presented at SIGGRAPH Asia 2020 that allows experts and amateurs alike to create rich, expressive, deformable 3D models from scratch — and to animate them — all in a casual mode, without ever having to leave the 2D plane. With Monster Mash, the user sketches out a character, and the software automatically converts it to a soft, deformable 3D model that the user can immediately animate by grabbing parts of it and moving them around in real time. There is also an online demo, where you can try it out for yourself.

**Nix is the ultimate DevOps toolkit**  
https://tech.channable.com/posts/2021-04-09-nix-is-the-ultimate-devops-toolkit.html  
At Channable we use Nix to build and deploy our services and to manage our development environments. This was not always the case: in the past we used a combination of ecosystem-specific tools and custom scripts to glue them together. Consolidating everything with Nix has helped us standardize development and deployment workflows, eliminate “works on my machine”-problems, and avoid unnecessary rebuilds. In this post we want to share what problems we encountered before adopting Nix, how Nix solves those, and how we gradually introduced Nix into our workflows.

**Beautiful PDFs from HTML**  
https://pdf.math.dev/  
A happenstance discussion on Hacker News brought my attention to [paged.js](https://www.pagedjs.org/), a genius idea to polyfill the required capabilities to allow browsers to natively handle paged media, without having to build the whole rendering engine from scratch. This guide provides a basic tutorial to using paged.js, for my own future reference and yours, and I highly recommend you visiting their site and supporting their project. In particular, their documentation covers many aspects of advanced paged media and is a worthwhile next step after reading this guide.

https://kwokchain.com/2021/02/05/atomic-concepts/  
In 2010, Photoshop was ubiquitous. Whether you were editing a photo, making a poster, or designing a website, it happened in Photoshop. Nevertheless, there are a few segments of design where they’re no longer the market leader. Companies like Figma, Sketch, and Canva are examples of products that have been able to become top products despite Adobe’s ubiquity in all things design.

**What should the next chat app look like?**  
https://drewdevault.com/2021/04/07/The-next-chat-app.html  
As you’re surely aware, Signal has officially jumped the shark with the introduction of cryptocurrency to their chat app. Back in 2018, I wrote about my concerns with Signal, and those concerns were unfortunately validated by this week’s announcement. Moxie’s insistence on centralized ownership, governance, and servers for Signal puts him in a position of power which is easily, and inevitably, abused. In that 2018 article, and in articles since, I have spoken about the important of federation to address these problems. In addition to federation, what else does a chat app need?

**Splitting Time Between Product and Engineering Efforts**  
https://css-tricks.com/splitting-time-between-product-and-engineering-efforts/  
At each company I’ve worked, we have had a split between time spent on Product initiatives and Engineering work. The percentages always changed, sometimes 70% Product, 30% Engineering, sometimes as much as a 50/50 split. The impetus is to make sure that Engineering spends a portion of their time building new features, but also ensures we can do “our own” work such as address technical debt, upgrade systems, and document our code. The trouble is, it’s one thing to say this at the outset, and another to make it a reality.
