**Get Ready For ESM**  
https://blog.sindresorhus.com/get-ready-for-esm-aa53530b3f77  
JavaScript Modules will soon be a reality for Node.js package maintainers. This blog post is targeted Node.js package maintainers. Releatead: [Snowpack v3.0: Reimagining Web Development with ESM](https://www.snowpack.dev/posts/2021-01-13-snowpack-3-0), [Updates from the npm team are now published on the GitHub Blog](https://blog.npmjs.org/), [Dynamic, Conditional Imports](https://css-tricks.com/dynamic-conditional-imports/).

**从可逆计算看LowCode**  
https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/344845973  
向LowCode转型意味着软件将进入工业化生产阶段。但自从上世纪七十年代以来，这种转向尝试早已不是什么新鲜事情，这一轮的LowCode运动又有什么特殊之处？它凭什么能完成前辈未竟之事业？本文试图从可逆计算理论的角度针对LowCode中的一些技术问题谈谈自己的看法。另附：[Model-driven engineering for Industrial IoT architectures](https://modeling-languages.com/modeling-industrial-iot-architectures/)。

**Want to teach your kids to code? Here are three apps that can help.**  
https://stackoverflow.blog/2021/01/12/want-to-teach-your-kids-to-code-here-are-three-apps-that-can-help/  
Like many of you, I am a coder with kids at home. What better time to start exposing our kids to the career we all think is amazing! You do think programming is amazing, right? 😀  Well, even if you don’t, coding teaches kids the fundamentals of logic and encourages them to think abstractly. Let’s…

**Whose Code is it Anyway?**  
https://engineeringblog.yelp.com/2021/01/whose-code-is-it-anyway.html  
In order to measure the engineering effectiveness of Yelp, we need to measure the effectiveness of its organizations and the teams that make up those organizations. But how do we know what a team is responsible for? We needed a way to assign an owner to something (let’s call this an entity) that we want to measure. Once an entity has an owner, we can collect metrics on that entity and derive the health score (i.e., effectiveness) for that owner. These metrics can then be aggregated by team, organization, or even the entire Engineering division, so that we can identify areas that we can collectively improve. And this is how the Ownership microservice was born.

**We Don't Need Data Scientists, We Need Data Engineers**  
https://www.mihaileric.com/posts/we-need-data-engineers-not-data-scientists/  
There are 70% more open roles at companies in data engineering as compared to data science. As we train the next generation of data and machine learning practitioners, let’s place more emphasis on engineering skills.

**State of JS 2020**  
https://2020.stateofjs.com/en-US/  
As crappy as 2020 was, JavaScript as a whole still managed to somehow move forward. As the language itself keeps improving thanks to new features like Optional Chaining and Nullish Coalescing, TypeScript's widespread adoption is taking things to a whole other level by popularizing static typing.

**Front-End Performance Checklist 2021**  
https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/01/front-end-performance-2021-free-pdf-checklist/  
So, if we created an overview of all the things we have to keep in mind when improving performance — from the very start of the project until the final release of the website — what would that look like? Below you’ll find a (hopefully unbiased and objective) front-end performance checklist for 2021 — an updated overview of the issues you might need to consider to ensure that your response times are fast, user interaction is smooth and your sites don’t drain user’s bandwidth.

**New Web Design Trends and Inspiration for 2021**  
https://tympanus.net/codrops/2021/01/11/new-web-design-trends-and-inspiration-for-2021/  
Web design trends come and go. Thanks to the upheaval in 2020, web designers are going to see some common trends fall by the wayside for safer design choices. Releated: [Web Design Trends 2021: The Report](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/01/web-design-trends-report-2021/), [Web History: Web Design](https://css-tricks.com/chapter-6-web-design/).

**大型 Web 应用插件化架构探索**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/EBI3NvirxKfRIRE9amJ4TQ  
随着 Web 技术的逐渐成熟，越来越多的应用架构趋向于复杂，例如阿里云、腾讯云等巨型控制台项目，每个产品下都有各自的团队来负责维护和迭代。不论是维护还是发布以及管控成本都随着业务体量的增长而逐渐不可控。在这个背景下微前端应用而生，微前端在阿里内部已经有许多成熟的实践，这里不再赘述。本文以微前端为引子(蹭热度)，探讨一些另类的Web 应用所面临的类似问题。

**Everything About React Server Components**  
https://vercel.com/blog/everything-about-react-server-components  
When it comes to building an application, the best developers accomplish three things: great user experience, scalability over time, and fast performance. Projects often sacrifice one of these to achieve the other two. React Server Components, announced at the end of 2020, will help reduce trade offs by enabling more features while decreasing the amount of JavaScript to evaluate on the client. This will make for a more pleasant user and developer experience due to faster performance.

**A Better React/Rails Architecture**  
https://multithreaded.stitchfix.com/blog/2021/01/06/a-better-react-rails-architecture/  
We recognize that microservices are not a panacea. This is not a blog post about how everyone should move to microservices. Our motivations are as much organizational as they are technical. We hope that by illustrating our past and future architecture, you will be able to use the pieces of our approach that are relevant to your own systems.

**Your legacy database is outgrowing itself**  
https://unstructed.tech/2021/01/11/your-legacy-database-is-outgrowing-itself/  
At the moment of writing this article, alexa.com ranked chess.com at 215th place in the world. We’ve got over 4M unique daily users and over 7B queries hitting all our MySQL databases combined. Went from under 1M unique users a day a year ago to 1.3M in March, to over 4M at the moment, with over 8M games played each day. I know it’s no where near the biggest players on the market, but our experience could help you “fix” your monolith database, and scale it to new heights

**Have the tables turned on NoSQL?**  
https://stackoverflow.blog/2021/01/14/have-the-tables-turned-on-nosql/  
NoSQL was the next big thing in system architecture in 2011, but overall interest in it has plateaued recently. What is NoSQL, what does it have to do wit.

**Rust is a hard way to make a web API**  
https://macwright.com/2021/01/15/rust.html  
If I were writing a geocoder, a routing engine, a real-time messaging platform, a database, or a CLI tool, Rust would be at the top of the list. But last year, I spent some time trying to make Rust work for a plain-vanilla API to power a normal website. It wasn’t a very good fit. Releated: [The current state of Rust web framework](https://blog.logrocket.com/the-current-state-of-rust-web-frameworks/), [WebAssembly and Rust: There and Back Again](https://codeburst.io/webassembly-and-rust-there-and-back-again-9ad76f61d616).

**Limiting Private API availability in Chromium**  
https://blog.chromium.org/2021/01/limiting-private-api-availability-in.html  
During a recent audit, we discovered that some third-party Chromium based browsers were able to integrate Google features, such as Chrome sync and Click to Call, that are only intended for Google’s use. This meant that a small fraction of users could sign into their Google Account and store their personal Chrome sync data, such as bookmarks, not just with Google Chrome, but also with some third-party Chromium based browsers.

**From Adobe Fireworks to Protopie**  
https://uxplanet.org/from-adobe-fireworks-to-protopie-d119bf33a111  
Some of us remember Fireworks, the first tool I used to create a clickable prototype. However, while Adobe was focusing on its cash cows (Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, Flash) for years, user experience (UX) designers started to use Sketch around 2013–2014. At that time, I was creating prototypes in Axure RP and occasionally Illustrator for wireframes and basic illustrations. Given the power of these software packages, I was not impressed with Sketch initially. It looked simple with a limited set of features.
