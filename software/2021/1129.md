**Agile Principles: Go Together**  
https://www.simplethread.com/agile-principles-4-go-together/  
The fourth Principle of the Agile Manifesto is one of the shortest: Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project. It’s only 11 words, but it has had an outsized effect on my career and how I think projects should be managed.

**Workflow automation: what it is, and how it can help you get ahead**  
https://blog.airtable.com/workflow-automation/  
A survey of global directors found 86% of them will invest in automation technology in the next 12-26 months. But what are the possibilities for workflow automation? And how does it work? Read on for the lowdown, plus pointers on what to look for when you choose workflow automation software.

**An Engineer's Hype-Free Observations on Web3 (and its Possibilities)**  
https://www.psl.com/feed-posts/web3-engineer-take  
Here in the PSL Studio, our veteran engineering team (hi, nice to meet you!) has been building fun new Web3 projects. Along the way, we’ve been taking notes on what we’ve learned, what the underlying technologies do (and do not) enable, and where we see opportunities in the future. We thought it’d be worthwhile to distill this list of observations and publish them here.

**30 years of the website: building web applications for the future**  
https://www.fastly.com/blog/30-years-of-the-website-building-web-applications-for-the-future  
Although we currently use websites in ways that make them closer to applications than the traditional idea of a website, we aren’t consistently building them that way. It’s time we embrace a more dynamic mindset in how we approach web development, and consider the tools we need to get there. 

**AVA 2.0：洞见，新开篇**  
https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/437946723  
去年我们发布了智能可视化框架 AVA，发布以来一些项目已经接入了图表推荐流程，初步实现了“有数就有图”。很感谢勇于尝鲜的朋友们，同时我们也收到了很多问题和建议。今年我们推出了 AVA 2.0 版本。我们提出了「经验驱动」和「洞察驱动」两条可视化推荐路径。在经验驱动的路径中，我们开放了全推荐链路的完整自定义能力，帮助有定制需求的项目实现接入。我们还设计了更合理的推荐流程，并提供了图表优化的功能。在洞察驱动的路径中，我们通过前端轻量化洞察挖掘能力，可以帮你从多维数据中发现关键洞察，并以可视化形式展示出来。此外，我们尝试开放了插件生态，可以通过增加简单配置，在推荐过程中加入智能配色等环节。

**「全码」 通用搭建：现代 Web 研发体系中的新一代低/零码搭建**  
https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/435484949  
终于有时间把稀土开发者大会上讲的「Web 开发引擎」和「低码」话题的分享，改成文字版发出来。现场演讲中后半部分内容是脱稿讲的，我重写成了更全的内容。「越来越庞大的应用开发需求」和「现代 Web 开发范式的红利」这两个部分的幻灯片，虽然在其他分享里用过，但在这个话题里，用途是不同的，文字内容是不同角度的，建议不要略过。

**Helping developers build powerful, installable web apps**  
https://developer.chrome.com/en/blog/pwa-install-features/  
At the beginning of 2020, the Chrome team across mobile and desktop laid out a plan to improve the discoverability and engagement of installed web apps. Our work led to a greater than 100% increase in PWA installation and engagement. We achieved this by researching existing features, running A/B test experiments and user interviews to gain insight into users perceptions and expectations. This article covers how we got there.

**My Custom CSS Reset**  
https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/custom-css-reset/  
Recently, I've been using my own custom CSS reset. It includes all of the little tricks I've discovered to improve both the user experience and the CSS authoring experience. Like other CSS resets, it's unopinionated when it comes to design / cosmetics. You can use this reset for any project, no matter the aesthetic you're going for. In this tutorial, we'll go on a tour of my custom CSS reset. We'll dig into each rule, and you'll learn what it does and why you might want to use it!

**美团跨端一体化富文本管理技术实践**  
https://tech.meituan.com/2021/11/25/page-webide-thrift.html  
为了提高研发效率，美团医药技术部开始构建了一个跨端一体化富文本管理平台，希望提供解决这一大类问题的产研方案。不过，部门最初的目标是开发一套提效工具，解决大量诸如帮助文档、协议页、消息通知、规则说明等静态页面的生产与发布问题，让产品和运营同学能够以所见即所得的方式自主完成静态页面制作与发布，进而缩短沟通成本和研发成本。但是，随着越来越多业务部门开始咨询并使用这个平台，我们后续不断完善并扩充了很多的功能。经过多次版本的设计和迭代开发后，将该平台命名为Page-佩奇，并且注册成为美团内部的公共服务，开始为美团内部更多同学提供更好的使用体验。本文将系统地介绍Page-佩奇平台的定位、设计思路、实现原理及取得成效。我们也希望这些实战经验与总结，能给更多同学带来一些启发和思考。

**Get started with validation in Node.js**  
https://simonplend.com/get-started-with-validation-in-node-js/  
In this article we’re going to learn how the JSON Schema specification can help us create flexible validation rules. We’ll write a schema which describes the format we expect data to be in, then we’ll use the Ajv validator library to validate our data against it.

**GraphQL Editor – The Journey from Initial Release to Version 5.0**  
https://davidwalsh.name/graphql-editor-the-journey-from-initial-release-to-version-5-0  
From the very beginning of our adventure with GraphQL, we were impressed by how great its community is. The amount of content, libraries and great tools generated by GraphQL users amazed us from the very start. The more time we spent working with GraphQL the more things we saw that could be improved to make working with it easier and better. We also knew that we wanted to give something back to its wonderful community.

**7 Ways to Improve Node.js Performance at Scale**  
https://blog.appsignal.com/2021/11/24/7-ways-to-improve-nodejs-performance-at-scale.html  
Performance is one of the most important aspects of web application development. A fast application will make its users, developers, and business stakeholders happy, while a slow one is sure to frustrate all three parties. In this article, we will consider some practices that you should adopt to scale your Node.js servers. Your servers will then be able to handle high traffic workloads without a degraded user experience.

**How To Maintain A Large Next.js Application**  
https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/11/maintain-large-nextjs-application/  
In this article, Nirmalya discusses some of the complex problems that he faced while building and maintaining large Next.js applications. He always explains how these problems can be solved by using various tools.

**Django, HTMX and Alpine.js: Modern websites, JavaScript optional**  
https://www.saaspegasus.com/guides/modern-javascript-for-django-developers/htmx-alpine/  
Building a modern front end in Django without reaching for a full-blown JavaScript framework. Choosing the right tools for the job, and bringing them into your project.

**How Dropbox Replay keeps everyone in sync**  
https://dropbox.tech/application/how-dropbox-replay-keeps-everyone-in-sync  
How do you recreate the experience of an in-person screening room with a remote, distributed team? This is one of the reasons we built Dropbox Replay, our new video collaboration tool. Dropbox customers told us the shift to virtual work had turned their once-straightforward review sessions into lengthy, inefficient video calls. It was clear their previous in-person workflows hadn’t made an elegant transition online.

**API management investments in the public sector and the challenges faced**  
https://tyk.io/blog/api-management-investments-in-the-public-sector-and-the-challenges-faced/  
As city governments look to improve their digital infrastructure and services for residents, API management services like Tyk can help them embrace a digital government and API infrastructure agenda. Each department can manage its own API gateway, which feeds into a central API management platform. The result? Departments can mature at their own pace while the platform manages consistency, standardization, and central oversight of infrastructure.

**42 things I learned from building a production database**  
https://maheshba.bitbucket.io/blog/2021/10/19/42Things.html  
In 2017, I went to Facebook on a sabbatical from my faculty position at Yale. I created a team to build a storage system called Delos at the bottom of the Facebook stack (think of it as Facebook’s version of Chubby). We hit production with a 3-person team in less than a year; and subsequently scaled the team to 30+ engineers spanning multiple sub-teams. In the four years that I led the team (until Spring 2021), we did not experience a single severe outage (nothing higher than a SEV3). The Delos design is well-documented in two academic papers (in OSDI 2020 and SOSP 2021). Delos is currently replacing all uses of ZooKeeper at Facebook. Here are some of the things I learned as the tech lead for Delos. My intent in publishing this is to help others in similar roles (leading teams that are building new infra at large companies); much of it may not generalize to different settings.

**Flickr Engineering Team Vision & Guiding Principles**  
https://code.flickr.net/2021/11/22/flickr-engineering-team-vision-guiding-principles/  
There’s a rich history of engineering innovation and excellence at Flickr. The team has been involved in the development of specs and open standards, been an early adopter of technologies like NodeJS, and successfully migrated from Yahoo data centers to AWS in less than a year!  Through all the years, there has been a sense of vision and principles on the team, but nothing formally documented.  We were inspired by Artsy and Amazon to create a team vision and guiding principles, and share those with the team, job candidates, and the public. We hope that this document evolves with the team, and look forward to discussing it with future coworkers!

**Overengineering can kill your product**  
https://www.mindtheproduct.com/overengineering-can-kill-your-product/  
I believe it because we will talk about one of the most prevalent issues when creating products: overengineering them. In my opinion, overengineering has killed more products than the absence of good development practices.

**从用过的 18 款软件开始，聊聊我为什么要选择开源软件**  
https://sspai.com/post/70059  
作为已经过了「不当家不知柴米油盐」年纪的普通用户，应对当前大势所趋的订阅及超前消费的方式就是选择适合自己的开源软件。其次，作为折腾软件十余年但不会编程的「玩家」，天然对开源软件有亲切感，非常喜欢这种奔着相对纯粹目的完善能够造福更多人的工具。最后，「实用为王」能够解决实际问题且符合自己使用习惯的开源软件会作为我的首选。本人日常工作生活主要用到 Windows 和 macOS 平台，偶尔还需要折腾 Linux。本文本着「完全无需付费，也能很好用」这一原则，我挑选了个人使用过的 18 款开源软件分享给大家。

**原子化思考**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/MW7Wxyk1mLUeHoikZVO0yA  
互联网平台公司的创始人，都有个原子化的思考方式。他们能够拥有比常人颗粒度更细，在原子的层面思考产品和商业模式。抽象思考能力帮助我们接近世界的本质。用户的需求是零散的，而产品经理的解决方案是归纳抽象的过程。

**拆掉思维里的墙**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/xx5hB1_6n79lM5IWZbhQGQ  
推倒一面墙，人生便多了一条路。很多时候，解决问题不在于学识的多寡、技术的高低，而在于你是否具备一种摒弃自我经验的勇气。当跳出思维的局限，你会发现：其实很多问题并不难。
