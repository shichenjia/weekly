**Happy Birthday, WWW – 30 years of mining a landfill for valid code**  
https://www.w3.org/blog/2021/08/30-years-on-from-introducing-the-web-to-the-world/  
https://christianheilmann.com/2021/08/06/happy-birthday-www-30-years-of-mining-a-landfill-for-valid-code/  
Today the World Wide Web is 30 years old. I’ve worked on it since 1997 or so and I saw a lot of technologies and design trends come and go. I’ve also seen a lot of “this is much better and will replace the web” solutions come and go. What remained is the web with its “dumb” technologies HTTP, HTML and CSS. Each of them are forgiving in their nature. They allow developers to make mistakes without punishing the end user. Many people sing the praise of this approach and architecture, so I’m not going to repeat it.

**Vue.js is Wikimedia Foundation's future JavaScript framework**  
https://lists.wikimedia.org/hyperkitty/list/wikitech-l@lists.wikimedia.org/thread/SOZREBYR36PUNFZXMIUBVAIOQI4N7PDU/  
With excitement we're sharing today that Vue.js is Wikimedia Foundation's official choice for adoption as future JavaScript framework for use with MediaWiki.

**Reflections on 10,000 Hours of Programming**  
https://matt-rickard.com/reflections-on-10-000-hours-of-programming/  
The key to achieving world-class expertise in any skill, is to a large extent, a matter of practicing the correct way, for a total of around 10,000 hours.

**A Model-Driven Approach for Multiexperience Development Platforms (MXDP)**  
https://modeling-languages.com/modeling-multiexperience-ai-user-interfaces-mxdp/  
The specification and the implementation of the User Interface (UI) of a system is a key aspect of any software development project. In most cases, this UI takes the form of a Graphical User Interface (GUIs) that encompasses a number of visual components to offer rich interactions between the user and the system. But nowadays, a new generation of UIs which integrate more interaction modalities (such as chat, voice and gesture) is gaining popularity.

**Metaverses**  
https://stratechery.com/2021/metaverses/  
http://www.geekpark.net/news/282459  
Satya Nadella, for the record, was first: on May 25, 2021, during the keynote for Microsoft’s Build developer conference, he characterized a collection of Azure offerings as a metaverse. The term “enterprise metaverse” came a month later at the Microsoft Inspire sales force keynote, but it was only on last week’s earnings call that most of the press caught on. As usual, no one cares unless Facebook is involved.

**Building architectures that can handle the world’s data**  
https://deepmind.com/blog/article/building-architectures-that-can-handle-the-worlds-data  
As part of DeepMind's mission of solving intelligence to advance science and humanity, we want to build systems that can solve problems that use many types of inputs and outputs, so we began to explore a more general and versatile architecture that can handle all types of data.

**Refactoring CSS: Strategy, Regression Testing and Maintenance**  
https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/08/refactoring-css-strategy-regression-testing-maintenance-part2/  
After analyzing CSS and its weaknesses, and management giving a green light to the refactoring project, it’s time to get to work. A team needs to agree on the internal code standards and best practices, plan out the refactoring strategy, and outline individual tasks. We need to set up a visual regression testing suite, and a maintenance plan to enforce the new standards and best practices in the future.

**开放与收敛 - 搭建系统的资产体系设计**  
https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/396327885  
搭建系统并不是一个稀奇的概念，从 Dreamweaver 开始，有大量的产品试图用装配式的开发解决应用生产的效率问题。它们面向特定场景做抽象、沉淀出最佳实践，再通过产品封装来加速整个制作过程。​比如 Dreamweaver 认为 HTML 树是不重要的，应该通过所见即所得的自由拖拽生成；比如 SwiftUI 认为移动场景下，数据的流向与更新应该被高度简化，于是提供简洁的交互来快速建立组件与模型间响应式的数据流。

**体系化的 Web 应用研发与极致信任的招聘**  
https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/395621272  
这篇文章既是对我之后要做的事情的介绍，也是代表快手商业化前端团队的招聘。我们想要打造一支有追求、重视自我提升的团队，去做真正有技术价值，有挑战的事情。

**配置即代码：先有鸡还是先有蛋**  
https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/340791156  
虽然文章的最后提出了我们在实际项目中经过筛选和迭代后实操的方案，但这一方案也并没有完美的解决配置即代码的鸡生蛋蛋生鸡的问题。反而相比于方案二，迭代方案在业务配置上对配置即代码的管理方式做出了让步，从而去除了强制业务使用代码管理配置的门槛。

**探索类型安全的 Node.js Web 框架**  
https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/373978696  
随着 TypeScript 的流行，类型系统也逐步进入了大家的视野，类型安全相关的问题也受到了更多人的关注，那今天我就以这个角度带大家感受 Farrow 在类型安全方面优秀方案的设计与思考，希望对大家能有所启发。

In this post, we are sharing for the first time the history and evolution of ZippyDB and some of the unique design choices and trade-offs made in building this service that addressed the majority of key-value store scenarios at Facebook.

**How we’re making Dropbox data centers 100% carbon neutral**  
https://dropbox.tech/infrastructure/making-dropbox-data-centers-carbon-neutral  
We decided to focus our sustainability efforts on customer data storage because—the Edelman 2021 Trust Barometer found that customers are 5.7% more likely to trust companies that embrace sustainable practices. For us there’s a simple metric: You can store all your stuff on Dropbox knowing our data loads are covered by 100% renewable electricity.

**Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2021**  
https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2021  
https://stackoverflow.blog/2021/08/02/q3-2021-ceo-blog-post-communities-catalyst/  
This year, for example, we observed a significant evolution in the way developers educate themselves. For the rising cohort of coders under the age of 18, online resources like videos and blogs are more popular than books and school combined, a statistic that doesn’t hold for any of our other age cohorts. Overall, the profession is full of new joiners, with more than 50% indicating they have been coding for less than a decade, and more than 35% having less than five years in the trade. The challenge and opportunity for us is to continue expanding and improving our ability to help all developers and to make them feel welcome in our community.

**Safari Isn't Protecting The Web, It's Killing It**  
https://httptoolkit.tech/blog/safari-is-killing-the-web/  
I don't want to rehash the basics of that, but I have seen some interesting rebuttals, most commonly: Safari is actually protecting the web, by resisting adding unnecessary and experimental features that create security/privacy/bloat problems. That is worth further discussion, because it's widespread, and wrong.

**How MDN’s autocomplete search works**  
https://hacks.mozilla.org/2021/08/mdns-autocomplete-search/  
Last month, Gregor Weber and I added an autocomplete search to MDN Web Docs, that allows you to quickly jump straight to the document you’re looking for by typing parts of the document title. This is the story about how that’s implemented. If you stick around to the end, I’ll share an “easter egg” feature that, once you’ve learned it, will make you look really cool at dinner parties. Or, perhaps you just want to navigate MDN faster than mere mortals.

**Welcome to the DevOps Platform era**  
https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2021/08/03/welcome-to-the-devops-platform-era/  
This increase in project-tool integrations called for a change in the way organizations adopted DevOps tools. At GitLab, we identified four phases of evolution in the adoption of DevOps tools over time.

**5 Reasons Why Designing Simple Experiences is Psychologically Impossible**  
https://uxmag.com/articles/5-reasons-why-designing-simple-experiences-is-psychologically-impossible  
Simple is exponentially harder than complex, namely because there’s a psychological chasm that most teams cannot surpass… or perhaps they have not been setup to succeed with simplicity due to a lack of time, money, and/or skill.

**腾讯高手都在学的「感知性模式设计」是什么？**  
https://www.uisdc.com/perceptual-pattern-design  
所谓的感知性模式就是物体或者物件的一种外在的呈现而给人的感觉或者感受。例如同样的一个电脑桌上都有电脑、鼠标、或者其他的物件摆设，但根据不同人的使用给人的感觉是完全不同的，或是凌乱、或是整洁、或是简约，而更直观的差异可能来源于这些物件的样式、材料、颜色、纹理的不同而传递出来的视觉感知，

**把人做好，就是改变世界**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/nNwDXrXrBjTz2DPOgsWtqg  
把人做好，就是建立人的成色，人的成色有了，所做一切事的成色也便有了，所谓“君子务本，本立而道生”。人亦是从这里，“为天地立心，为生民立命，为往圣继绝学，为万世开太平”。改造自己即是改造世界的本位成色，改造行为即是改造世界的流通成色，这就是所谓改变世界，是真真实实、实实在在的改变世界，而并没有别的改变世界。
