**Agile at 20: The Failed Rebellion**  
https://www.simplethread.com/agile-at-20-the-failed-rebellion/  
The Agile Manifesto turned 20 this year, and there are two facts that seem self-evident:  
- Agile, as a label, won; nobody wants to be called non-Agile.  
- Agile, as it is practiced, falls woefully short of the revolutionary ideas of its founders.  

How did we get to this point? Everybody says they do Agile and yet almost nobody is Agile.

**Overview of the RenderingNG architecture**  
https://developer.chrome.com/blog/renderingng-architecture/  
In a previous post, I gave an overview of the RenderingNG architecture goals and key properties. This post will explain how its component pieces are set up, and how the rendering pipeline flows through them.

**Headless UI v1.4: The One With Tabs**  
https://blog.tailwindcss.com/headless-ui-v1-4  
We just released Headless UI v1.4, which includes a brand new Tab component, and new APIs for manually closing Popover and Disclosure components more easily.

**Technical blogs worth reading**  
https://web.eecs.utk.edu/~azh/blog/favblogs.html  
This list is so that I can easily share my favorite blogs to colleagues and students. These blogs cover programming, software engineering, startups, product design, usability, research, game development, and academia. They are in no particular order, but I provide a few categories for each and an example post that I recommend.

**Responsible AI: Bridging From Ethics to Practice**  
https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2021/8/254306-responsible-ai/fulltext  
The high expectations of AI have triggered worldwide interest and concern, generating 400+ policy documents on responsible AI. Intense discussions over the ethical issues lay a helpful foundation, preparing researchers, managers, policy makers, and educators for constructive discussions that will lead to clear recommendations for building the reliable, safe, and trustworthy systems6 that will be commercial success. This Viewpoint focuses on four themes that lead to 15 recommendations for moving forward. The four themes combine AI thinking with human-centered User Experience Design (UXD).

**Why Angular is the best front-end for the enterprise**  
https://sredmond.medium.com/why-angular-is-the-best-front-end-for-the-enterprise-edd225094f3  
Since enterprises generally tend to have a wide array of products, standardization is generally an issue. They want all their products to be developed similarly, and they want to share common core code or components. I want to mention right away that these are not easy things to do no matter what you use. And these things may not even be possible or be your best option for your use case. These are just trends I’ve noticed over the years. Another trend I’ve noticed over the years is that Angular has become, by in large, the best front-end technology to help companies do these things.

**多子类型业务架构演进**  
https://yanhaijing.com/program/2021/07/22/decoupling-the-large-subtype/  
最近文章写得少了，都是因为在填耦合架构的坑，人生苦短，填坑不完，o(╥﹏╥)o，对如何治理耦合架构感兴趣，可以看我之前的文章—— [比耦合架构更好的架构](https://yanhaijing.com/program/2021/07/17/coupling-and-composition/)。好不容易从耦合坑里爬出来，又踩到了多子类型的坑，大坑套小坑，放眼望去，我太难了o(╥﹏╥)o

**狼人就是我们自己**  
https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/393299274  
构造出一套全新的开发工具并不会 10x 提效，也不能避免代码越写越往焦油坑里陷。恰恰相反，狼人就是我们自己，各种自作聪明才是加速代码腐化的原因。拆分是必须的，但是拆分总是依赖于每个人的主观判断，无法用自动化工具检查拆分的规则，用静态类型系统约束代码，强制规范一致性，这是目前主流实践最大的盲点。但这也不需要重新发明一套编程工具链，只需要编译期加一些 linter 工具。

**云开发 Webify 正式上线：专为Web开发者打造的云上开发部署平台**

https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/tv5hE_D-NRhxt3-A6w4HcQ  
近日，在 HashiCorp 的博客（https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/mitchell-s-new-role-at-hashicorp）中，宣布了一个重要决定，他表示：作为一名高级管理者，在经过了10年的学习成长之后，已经准备好兴奋的回归到工程师的职位。

**数字化技术战略：技术产品化运营**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/ndnNEaFdBdsxi9Q1HHPKrQ  
技术产品化运营，是将技术产品（如开放 API、开源软件、开放平台、SDK、工具等）视为产品，在组织内部或者外部进行推广，以吸引更多的用户、开发者等参与到其中，加入到技术产品开发中，或者是采用该技术产品在其应用域构建解决方案。

**Running CPU-Bound Tasks in Node.js: Introduction to Worker Threads**  
https://yarin.dev/nodejs-cpu-bound-tasks-worker-threads/  
With that being said, and while running CPU-bound tasks is definitely not Node’s core use case, there are ways to make it work. Since its inception, Node.js has made significant progress on that front, and you should now be able to run occasional CPU-bound tasks with reasonable performance.

**Thinking About The Cut-Out Effect: CSS or SVG?**  
https://ishadeed.com/article/thinking-about-the-cut-out-effect/  
In a recent front-end project, one of the components included an interesting cut-out effect. There are multiple ways to do such an effect in CSS or SVG, but each way has its pros and cons. I thought about exploring the solutions for this challenge and share them with you. To follow along with the article, you need to have basic CSS and SVG knowledge. If not, it’s totally fine as I will try to explain everything in detail.

**Separation of concerns with React hooks**  
https://felixgerschau.com/react-hooks-separation-of-concerns/  
Custom hooks are only one way to increase modularity; I would also highly recommend splitting components and functions into smaller, reusable chunks when possible.

**Simple monorepos via npm workspaces and TypeScript project references**  
https://2ality.com/2021/07/simple-monorepos.html

**Sending Emails with Google Sheets & Scripts**  
https://spin.atomicobject.com/2021/07/27/sending-emails-google-sheets-scripts/  
Google Sheets and Google Scripts have been a powerful combo for me in the past. A recent request to help required a deeper dive into that combo and include sending emails with Google Sheets. We’ll walk through an example covering the key takeaways from this experience. That includes sending emails based on data in a Google Sheet, ways to structure your data importing, and how to schedule the script to run.

**How I Built a Cross-Platform Desktop Application with Svelte, Redis, and Rust**

**My wish-list for the next YAML**  
https://drewdevault.com/2021/07/28/The-next-YAML.html  
I think it’s clear to most that YAML is in dire need of replacement, which is why many have tried. But many have also failed. So what are the key features of YAML which demonstrate its strengths, and key weaknesses that could be improved upon?
