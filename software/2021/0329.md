**从前端角度看企业软件的研发过程**  
https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/149802972  
一直以来，企业软件前端工程体系处于一个很尴尬的局面，无数前端对它有过各种吐槽：技术栈老旧、封闭，体验差，而项目和交付经理又会觉得开发效率太低。据我所见，大部分吐槽的人并没有理解造成这些状况的深层原因，或者说，当自己去构建这么一套体系的时候，并不理解在选型和技术集成过程中，存有哪些可能的决策点。本文尝试从一些角度去给出自己的见解，为了说明构建这个领域前端技术体系的种种考虑，同时也会述及对应的业务特性。

**开发者体验 —— 内部工具的“最后一公里”**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/iwba1flyVpFYryu79-Id0g  
而完善开发者体验是有一些基础条件的：稳定性。SDK、库、框架等具备满足使用方持续可用的状态。功能完备。可以满足大部分的正常的功能需求。简单来说，就是只有在可用的情况下，设计开发者体验会更加有价值，即开发者体验是一个加分项。而如果我们能在开发的前期就考虑用户体验的话，它会为后续的开发带来便利。

**Human-Readable JavaScript: A Tale of Two Experts**  
https://alistapart.com/article/human-readable-javascript/  
Everyone wants to be an expert. But what does that even mean? Over the years I’ve seen two types of people who are referred to as “experts.” Expert 1 is someone who knows every tool in the language and makes sure to use every bit of it, whether it helps or not. Expert 2 also knows every piece of syntax, but they’re pickier about what they employ to solve problems, considering a number of factors, both code-related and not.

**前端还有机会吗？这是蚂蚁前端的答案**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/sE_gIdQtigzxTsvMxEK60w
近年来前端行业飞速发展，需要 学习 的知识越来越多，有些人套用现在一个很火的词，称前端行业“内卷”，咋一听好像前端没有前途了，有些有志于前端的同学因此犹豫。但真相真的是这样吗？3月18日，蚂蚁体验技术部举行了一次直播，部门负责人玉伯和其它前端专家、新晋校招生聚在一起，专门探讨了这些大家关心的话题，让我们看看他们是怎么回答的。

**设计稿（UI视图）自动生成代码方案的探索**  
https://tech.meituan.com/2021/03/25/ui2dsl-dsl2code.html  
设计稿（UI视图）转代码是前端工程师日常不断重复的工作，这部分工作复杂度较低但工作占比较高，所以提升设计稿转代码的效率一直是前端工程师追求的方向之一。此前，前端工程师尝试过将业务组件模块化构建成通用视图库，并通过拖拽、拼接等形式搭建业务模块，从而实现视图复用，降低设计稿转代码的研发成本。但随着业务的发展和个性化的驱动，通用视图库无法覆盖所有应用场景，本文提出了一种设计稿自动生成代码的方案。

**Get better at programming by learning how things work**  
https://jvns.ca/blog/learn-how-things-work/  
When we talk about getting better at programming, we often talk about testing, writing reusable code, design patterns, and readability. All of those things are important. But in this blog post, I want to talk about a different way to get better at programming: learning how the systems you’re using work! This is the main way I approach getting better at programming.

**How MDN’s site-search works**  
https://hacks.mozilla.org/2021/03/how-mdns-site-search-works/  
Periodically, the whole of MDN is built, by our Node code, in a GitHub Action. A Python script bulk-publishes this to Elasticsearch. Our Django server queries the same Elasticsearch via /api/v1/search. The site-search page is a static single-page app that sends XHR requests to the /api/v1/search endpoint. Search results’ sort-order is determined by match and “popularity”.

**The World Has Changed – Why Haven’t Database Designs**  
https://www.nextplatform.com/2021/03/25/the-world-has-changed-why-havent-database-designs/  
Every tool, system, and practice we encounter was designed at some point in time. They were made in particular ways for particular reasons. And those designs often persist like relics long after the rationale behind them has disappeared. They live on – sometimes for better, sometimes for worse. Releated: [It’s Been Decades. Why Don’t Databases Manage Themselves Yet?](https://www.brentozar.com/archive/2021/03/its-been-decades-why-dont-databases-manage-themselves-yet/)

**How we implemented Distributed Multi-document ACID Transactions in Couchbase**  
https://blog.couchbase.com/distributed-multi-document-acid-transactions/  
ACID Transactions are a must when you have strict data consistency requirements in your application. The costs of running transactions on distributed systems can rapidly create bottlenecks at scale. In this article, we will give you an overview of some of the challenges faced by NoSQL and NewSQL databases. Then, we’ll deep dive into how Couchbase implemented a scalable distributed transaction model with no central coordination and no single point of failure. Additionally, I will also give a short overview of how the support for transactions in N1QL looks like on Couchbase 7.0.

https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2021/03/17/why-do-gitlab-designers-contribute-to-the-codebase/  
Working with engineering in the past used to feel so foreign to me. I never truly understood all the complexities of collaborative software development, and in full transparency, I still don’t. However, using GitLab has taught me how to contribute to the success of our product.

**UI Components in Atomic Design**  
https://www.uxpin.com/studio/blog/atomic-ui-components/  
Atomic Design: once an obscure concept, it’s gained popularity in recent years. And it’s a hot design trend for good reason. When done correctly, Atomic Design allows teams to deploy truly unique design systems. What’s more, these design systems offer unparalleled high-quality, consistent UI, which benefits users and developers alike. In this post, we’ll discuss the ins and outs of Atomic Design, and what you need to know about the UI components within it.

**毁掉一个聪明人的方法，是让他变成“解释型人才”**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/o2YubfF8TqZR-Q1eEfEKag  
所谓解释型人才，是指“根据表面规律，作出夹层解释，并且爱上自己的解释”的聪明人。“解释型人才”生产两样东西：安全感和希望。尽管二者都是错觉。对于一个擅长解释的人，3个最大的陷阱是：光说不练、先入为主、事后归因。人类是基于想象的动物。对过去的解释，对现在的幻觉，和对未来的预测，大多属于想象的范畴。人们经常不由自主地像“解释过去”那样去“解释未来”。对于过去，统计比解释重要；对于现在，行动比解释重要；对于未来，信念比解释重要。只有当你懂得了统计、行动和信念时，解释才变得重要。
