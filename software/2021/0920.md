https://www.infoq.com/news/2021/09/api-design-first-addr/  
The API consultant James Higginbotham wrote recently about the advantages of adopting an API design-first approach using the “Align-Define-Design-Refine” (ADDR) process. ADDR is an iterative process meant to guide its adopters through such API design-first techniques. Designing an API iteratively while ensuring that all stakeholders are actively involved is essential to agility in development.

**Reducing The Need For Pseudo-Elements**  
https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/09/reducing-need-pseudo-elements/  
For years, pseudo-elements have faithfully helped front-end developers implement creative designs. While they still have an important place, we can now leave pseudo-elements behind in some scenarios, thanks to newer CSS properties.

**Building apps in minutes, not months**  
https://alexanderobenauer.com/labnotes/001/  
What if you could build an entire, production-ready app not in weeks or months — but in minutes? In order to build the many experiments for my research on the future of personal computing, and the subsequent demos for these Lab Notes, I needed a way to build much faster than was presently possible (the work simply won’t work if it takes weeks or months to scale up each experiment; the learning has to be faster than that).

**The Show Must Go On: Securing Netflix Studios At Scale**  
https://netflixtechblog.com/the-show-must-go-on-securing-netflix-studios-at-scale-19b801c86479

**Superpack: Pushing the limits of compression in Facebook’s mobile apps**  
https://engineering.fb.com/2021/09/13/core-data/superpack/  
Over the past two years, Superpack has been able to check developer-induced app size growth and keep our Android apps small. Superpack’s compression has helped reduce the size of our fleet of Android apps, which are substantially smaller in comparison to regular Android APK compression, with average savings of over 20 percent compared with Android’s default Zip compression. Some apps that use Superpack include Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger. The reduction in the size of these apps thanks to Superpack is illustrated in the table below.

**Why your data needs a QA process**

At this point, most software engineers see the value of testing their software regularly. But are you testing your data engineering as well?

**How to Program Yourself to Program Better**  
https://spin.atomicobject.com/2021/09/20/program-yourself/  
After more than a year of programming, I’ve started to notice some peculiar habits. For a while, these habits seemed like odd tics, until enough of them developed and a pattern emerged. I had begun programming myself.

**High-Fidelity Prototyping vs. Low-Filedity Prototypes: Which to Choose When?**  
https://www.uxpin.com/studio/blog/high-fidelity-prototyping-low-fidelity-difference/  
Low-fidelity prototypes allow teams to test information architecture and user flows, while high-fidelity prototypes introduce UI elements and how the user might interact with the final design. In this article, we will explore low-fidelity and high-fidelity prototypes—which to use and when?

**Designing with JSON in Sketch**  
https://medium.com/sketch-app-sources/designing-with-json-in-sketch-79d9e20fa49b  
I last wrote about using data in Sketch back in 2018. Sketch 52 had just added support for populating designs with a random image selected from a folder of images, or with a random piece of text from a plain text (.txt) file. It was a cool new feature, but was rather limited. There was no way to connect multiple bits of data — an image with an associated piece of text, for example. Sketch 71 added a Linked Data feature — the ability to use a .json file to populate text and image layers.

**如何梳理团队良好关系，避免暴力沟通？**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/CA6vAJ8kBPYDcUE2npDA_A  
写这篇文章的初衷在于一次全面反馈，一次4D团队调查，以及自己在负责百人项目团队过程中面临的各种问题，并结合着点燃团队之火、非暴力沟通以及项目管理中的领导力三本书的学习。在读到暴力沟通的四种来源时，回顾这一年多以来，原来自己在项目管理过程中，也有不同程度的暴力沟通。尽管出发点是好的，或者说最终的项目阶段性成果也不差，但复盘总结时，会发现很多时候并不需要如此，换一种方式可能会更好，换一种沟通方式可能会让团队成员感觉更舒适一些。
