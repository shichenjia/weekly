**Developers can't fix bad management**  
https://iism.org/article/developers-can-t-fix-bad-management-57  
https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27458785  
I keep seeing these articles chastising developers for not understanding why they are making changes, how just blindly implementing changes without understanding the underlying 'why' is a mistake. Cries abound of "look up, stop focusing so much on writing the code!" In my opinion, these articles are targeted at the wrong group of people. Releated: [The Work-From-Home Future Is Destroying Bosses' Brains](https://ez.substack.com/p/the-work-from-home-future-is-destroying), [Are we returning to the office? Or is the future remote?](https://a16z.com/2021/06/08/are-we-returning-to-the-office-or-is-the-future-remote/).

**The Plan for React 18**

https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/379072979  
When it’s released, React 18 will include out-of-the-box improvements (like automatic batching), new APIs (like startTransition), and a new streaming server renderer with built-in support for React.lazy.

**Named arguments in JavaScript**  
https://blog.jcoglan.com//2021/06/07/named-arguments-in-javascript/  
In type theory for named arguments we developed the idea of named arguments as a distinct type whose desired behaviour differs from that of records, which are the usual way of modelling polymorphic objects. We determined that for record types, it’s fine for a caller to pass an object with fields the called function does not use, but for named arguments this should be considered an error.

**Clever vs Insightful Code**  
https://www.hillelwayne.com/post/cleverness/  
“Don’t write clever code.” Why not? “Because it’s hard to understand.” People who say this think of clever code such as Duff’s Device.

**How hard can it be to maintain a rich text editor?**  
https://www.tiny.cloud/blog/how-hard-can-it-be-to-maintain-a-rich-text-editor/  
So, what’s an ‘acceptable’ maintenance level? It’s maintenance that stops software from becoming an ongoing and painful headache for everyone involved. We can see that the maintenance of software, including adding a rich text editor, is actually pretty challenging.

**我为什么放弃360千万期权，走向创业这条搬砖路**  
https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/378359391  
最近半年，我对创业有了新的感悟，清华有句校训：为祖国健康工作50年，那我们创业者也要记住这句：为祖国健康创业50年。很多厉害的人消失了，为什么？不是因为不厉害了，而是心态发生了转变。不愿意再去挑战自己，不愿意再给自己定更高标准。张一鸣推崇的理念：day one心态，对我们何尝不也适用呢？拥有保持一颗成长之心、创业之心，不断给自己设置更高的目标，去突破、去完成。立下的Flag，要一个不丢下的实现！愿我们在创业这条路上，走出精彩人生！

**[译]我终于逃离了 Node**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/nsHF4A6Xry_YsWnNMYlA6g  
像 Elixir 和 Ruby 之类的语言都是创造的行为。JavaScript 恰恰相反：JavaScript 是一种进化。Node 在每个层面，对所有人而言都充满惊奇的事情。JavaScript 总能在细微之处找到破坏你、羞辱你的方法。它不是一个人的设计作品，只是自然选择的冷酷结果。它到处都是神秘的进化怪癖。不管是好是坏，它都是完全民主的结果，是人民的语言。

**Can Firefox’s new look save the web browser?**  
https://www.techradar.com/news/can-firefoxs-new-look-save-the-web-browser  
Web browsers look incredibly similar these days, with the tabs on top, a menu accessible to the right, and a bookmarks bar if you so choose. However, Mozilla has been unique in these browser wars, working on improving its own Gecko engine instead of moving to WebKit or Google’s Chromium variant, as Microsoft Edge has.

**Scaling of Uber’s API gateway**  
https://eng.uber.com/scaling-api-gateway/  
When a platform is used by a large volume of engineers to develop endpoints, it naturally creates points of contention, which can slow people down and ultimately reduce the overall developer velocity across the company. In this article, we will talk about how we scaled this platform to be used by hundreds of engineers at Uber daily. We will dive deep into the code build aspect of our configuration management component, the challenges we faced as we rolled this out, and how we solved them.
