**Complexity Explained**  
https://complexityexplained.github.io/
Complexity science, also called complex systems science, studies how a large collection of components – locally interacting with each other at small scales – can spontaneously self-organize to exhibit non-trivial global structures and behaviors at larger scales, often without external intervention, central authorities or leaders. The properties of the collection may not be understood or predicted from the full knowledge of its constituents alone. Such a collection is called a complex system and it requires new mathematical frameworks and scientific methodologies for its investigation.

**How to hire senior developers: Give them more autonomy**  
https://hiringengineersbook.com/post/autonomy/  
https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26027448  
If we agree with Naur’s assessment of programming, what follows is that the value of a high tech company is inseparably interwoven with the development team, and the model of the problem domain in their heads. What this means, in essence: The main value of a software company is the mapping of source code and problem space in the developer’s heads. This conclusion has important consequences for many aspects of a software company, but especially for management, hiring and overall culture.

**Core Web Vitals – a vital aspect of user experience in 2021?**  
https://www.wholegraindigital.com/blog/core-web-vitals/  
If you’re a digital marketing manager then you work day in, day out to ensure that your websites are working well for your organisation, and you’re always looking for new ways to make them better. Ensuring that you rank well in Google is no doubt always high on your agenda. In May 2021, Google is going to be introducing a significant change to its ranking algorithm, and unusually they’ve told everyone what it is in advance. How nice of them! The new ranking factors are grouped together under the not so catchy name of Core Web Vitals. Let’s take a look at what they are, why they matter, and what you can do about it.

**A Framework for Writing Better Documentation**  
https://documentation.divio.com/  
There is a secret that needs to be understood in order to write good software documentation: there isn’t one thing called documentation, there are four. They are: tutorials, how-to guides, technical reference and explanation. They represent four different purposes or functions, and require four different approaches to their creation. Understanding the implications of this will help improve most documentation - often immensely.

**The web is something different**  
https://daverupert.com/2021/02/the-web-is-something-different/  
To be clear, I hate the “The web is for documents” take as much as I hate the “I build web apps, not websites” take as much as the “The web is a compile target” take as much as I hate the “The web has to compete with native apps” take. Those takes always seem to end up as some kind of scaffolding for a pissing contest, an attempt to denigrate someone else’s line of work.

https://ahl.medium.com/aws-outposts-2021-stories-for-folks-who-love-spreadsheets-72a2adcfb7b9  
AWS Outposts is an extension of the cloud that lives in your own facilities (either your DC or a colo). It’s a 42U rack that comes with different quantities of EC2 instance types (and therefore different quantities of CPU threads (vCPUs), DRAM, GPUs, and SSD capacity). It’s not a private cloud in that it is tightly bound to the AWS control plane (and a particular AWS region and availability zone). Rather, it’s a little chunk of AWS physically close to your other systems. All the analysis below is grounded on calculations you can find in this spreadsheet.
