**front-of-the-front-end and back-of-the-front-end web development**  
https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/front-of-the-front-end-and-back-of-the-front-end-web-development/  
A succinct way I’ve framed the split is that a front-of-the-front-end developer determines the look and feel of a button, while a back-of-the-front-end developer determines what happens when that button is clicked.

**The web didn't change; you did**  
https://remysharp.com/2021/02/11/the-web-didnt-change-you-did  
The web really didn't change. It really didn't become complex. The web development process is not one single path. There is simply more choice and more options. We, you and I, the developers, consumers and businesses are responsible for demanding more complicated (and more thorough) tools. We are not, however, beholden to complexity.

**You probably don’t need a micro-frontend**  
https://blog.scottlogic.com/2021/02/17/probably-dont-need-microfrontends.html  
At Scott Logic we’ve been building complex front-end applications, predominantly for financial services, for many years. Recently I ‘compared notes’ with a number of engineers who had worked on these applications to see whether a micro-frontend pattern had started to emerge. To my surprise - it hadn’t! This blog post asks the question why?

**Behind the Scenes of the Decentralized Web Principles**  
http://blog.archive.org/2021/02/18/behind-the-scenes-of-the-decentralized-web-principles/  
While several thousand people have participated in DWeb-related events and discussions organized by the Internet Archive, we still lacked a general consensus about the principles we collectively stand for. What values do we share beyond giving people more control, and not being “centralized”? What specific features did DWeb projects need to have to be considered, well, DWeb? These were the underlying questions that motivated us to create these DWeb Principles.

**Defining the enterprise technology roadmap**  
https://www.nearform.com/blog/the-enterprise-technology-roadmap/  
The right technology roadmap is more than a route to greater automation or efficiency for businesses: Technology sits at the nexus of so many business and consumer relationships that designing and embracing the right technology strategy can mean the difference between surviving in the marketplace and not.

**Faster JavaScript calls**  
https://v8.dev/blog/adaptor-frame  
The arguments adaptor frame was an ad-hoc solution to calls with a mismatch number of arguments and formal parameters. It was a straightforward solution, but it came with high performance cost and added complexity to the codebase. The performance cost is nowadays exacerbated by many Web frameworks using this feature to create a more flexible API. The simple idea of reversing the arguments in the stack allowed a significant reduction in implementation complexity and removed almost the entire overhead for such calls.

**SVG: The Good, the Bad and the Ugly**  
https://www.eisfunke.com/article/svg-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly.html  
I’ve been using SVG together with Inkscape regularly for a few years for sketches and graphics, and like to write it by hand to satisfy my love for precision and art through code. SVG and I have a kind of love-hate relationship. It’s powerful and has some nice free and open-source tooling, but the format itself is 
pretty ugly.

**API Design Guidance: Extended CRUD**  
https://tyk.io/api-design-guidance-extended-crud/  
A common situation in API design is the need to go beyond the typical CRUD (create-read-update-delete) interaction model. For example, some APIs may need to support actions such as submit, approve, and decline. With our somewhat limited HTTP methods, we must find new ways to offer the extended lifecycle while honouring the HTTP specification. Let’s take a look at how we can extend our API designs beyond the typical CRUD model.

**Fast and Reliable Schema-Agnostic Log Analytics Platform**  
https://eng.uber.com/logging/  
Since starting with ELK for logging in 2014, our system traffic volume and use case variance had both grown significantly. As we reached a scale bottleneck to support this rapidly growing traffic, we decided to take our insights about Uber’s many logging use cases and build our next-gen platform to fundamentally improve the reliability, scalability, performance, and most importantly to ensure a pleasant experience for both its users and operators.

**How we designed our Continuous Integration System to be more than 50% Faster**  
https://medium.com/pinterest-engineering/how-we-designed-our-continuous-integration-system-to-be-more-than-50-faster-b70a59342fe2  
The Engineering Productivity team’s vision is to “build a developer platform that inspires developers to do their best work.” One of the integral pieces of this platform is the Continuous Integration (CI) pipelines. The CI pipelines are responsible for validating code changes and producing release artifacts that can be deployed to one of our supported Continuous Delivery platforms. With over 1,000 engineers at the company, our team is faced with an interesting challenge of providing reliable and fast CI pipelines that serve the major repositories at scale. In order to meet those outcomes, our team made a few key design choices.

**Faster, more efficient systems for finding and fixing regressions**  
https://engineering.fb.com/2021/02/17/developer-tools/fix-fast/  
To enable us to scale our developer infrastructure to this volume — while also mitigating and minimizing regressions — we build tools and mechanisms to help engineers understand whether a diff has introduced (or will introduce) a regression. We consider the feedback we get from these tools as signals. Signals can be generated by automated tests, static analysis frameworks, performance logs, crash dumps, bug reports, production monitoring alarms, and dozens of other sources. These signals can be surfaced at any stage of the development life cycle. A given diff can generate hundreds of signals — including errors, successes, and warnings — that can help an engineer assess whether that diff is ready to be landed into a stable branch and begin making its way into production. After a diff has landed, signals are usually delivered to engineers via our task management system. An individual engineer can easily have hundreds of tasks in their backlog.

**Rearranging the Visual World**  
https://ai.googleblog.com/2021/02/rearranging-visual-world.html  
Transporter Nets bring a promising approach to learning vision-based manipulation, but are not without limitations. For example, they can be susceptible to noisy 3D data, we have only demonstrated them for sparse waypoint-based control with motion primitives, and it remains unclear how to extend them beyond spatial action spaces to force or torque-based actions. But overall, we are excited about this direction of work, and we hope that it provides inspiration for extensions beyond the applications we’ve discussed.

**Building a Rule-Based Platform to Manage Netflix Membership SKUs at Scale**  
https://netflixtechblog.com/building-a-rule-based-platform-to-manage-netflix-membership-skus-at-scale-e3c0f82aa7bc  
To solve the challenges mentioned above and meet our rapidly evolving business needs, we re-architected the legacy SKU catalog from the ground up and partnered with the Growth Engineering team to build a scalable SKU platform. This re-design enabled us to reposition the SKU catalog as an extensible, scalable, and robust rule-based “self-service” platform. It was a massive but necessary undertaking to ensure that Netflix is ready for the next phase of rapid global growth and business challenges.

**How Materialize and other databases optimize SQL subqueries**  
https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/materialize-decorrelation  
Subqueries are a SQL feature that allow writing queries nested inside a scalar expression in an outer query. Using subqueries is often the most natural way to express a given problem, but their use is discouraged because most databases struggle to execute them efficiently. This post gives a rough map of existing approaches to optimizing subqueries and also describes how Materialize differs from them. It is NOT a freestanding or complete explanation - it points to several papers and also assumes background knowledge of SQL and query plans. But it does contain all the things I wish I knew when I started working on this. Releated: [Understanding SQL JOIN](https://thoughtbot.com/blog/understanding-sql-join).

**Why is it so hard to see code from 5 minutes ago?**  
https://web.eecs.utk.edu/~azh/blog/yestercode.html  
A study found that Java developers backtracked every 6 minutes, meaning they reverted their code to a previous state (e.g., by clicking undo or pressing Ctrl-Z).1 These undo actions come in bursts and are often followed by successive redo actions. In fact, one participant in a different study used undo/redo 40 times in 5 minutes!2 When asked why they did this, they revealed they were trying to view some intermediate state of the code in the middle of a change. Why is it so hard to see code from 5 minutes ago while in the middle of a change?
