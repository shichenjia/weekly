**25 Years of CSS**  
https://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2021/05/25/25-years-of-css/  
And it all kicked off 25 years ago this month in a conference room in Paris, May 7th, 1996.  What a journey it’s been.  I wonder now, in the latter half of my life, what CSS — what the web itself — will look like in another 25 years.

**Sparkplug — a non-optimizing JavaScript compiler**  
https://v8.dev/blog/sparkplug  
As we turn to improving the performance of the actual initial JavaScript execution, however, we start to hit limitations when optimising our interpreter. V8’s interpreter is highly optimised and very fast, but interpreters have inherent overheads that we can’t get rid of; things like bytecode decoding overheads or dispatch overheads that are an intrinsic part of an interpreter’s functionality.

**Google is officially releasing its Fuchsia OS, starting w/ first-gen Nest Hub**  
https://9to5google.com/2021/05/25/google-releases-fuchsia-os-nest-hub/  
The Fuchsia-based update for the Nest Hub will roll out over the coming months, starting with those in the Preview Program, before eventually becoming more broadly available. Considering the interface and experience will be unchanged, it’s likely that Nest Hub owners won’t even notice they’ve been switched over to Fuchsia OS. 

**The Expanse UI Design**  
https://www.hudsandguis.com/home/2021/theexpanse  
At the end of the day though, the design needs to support the storytelling first. The screens are far from being perfect, the team put a lot care and passion into them. I learned a great deal on The Expanse, and I was happy that I was able to bring a lot of my training, knowledge, and experience to the show.

**A Vision to Compute like Nature: Thermodynamically**  
https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2021/6/252841-a-vision-to-compute-like-nature/fulltext  
Software developers' ability to imagine and program effective computational abstractions and implementations are clearly challenged in complex domains like economic systems, ecological systems, medicine, social systems, warfare, and autonomous vehicles. Machine learning techniques, such as deep neural networks, can help but their capabilities are limited and they are implemented on top of the digital hardware with the aforementioned challenges.

**Should we rebrand REST?**  
https://kieranpotts.com/rebranding-rest/  
In this blogpost I argue the case for consigning the term "REST API" to history. In its place we should adopt the terms "HTTP API" and "hypermedia API", which better differentiate two distinctive designs for the programmatic interfaces of web services.

**Why Decentralised Applications Don’t Work**  
https://ingrids.space/posts/why-distributed-systems-dont-work/  
What we’re dealing with here is far removed from physical resources, however, and the system has not been adapted at all. Although some like to idealise the aforementioned market as a free and unregulated system, the truth is that it optimises rather poorly under those circumstances, and needs heavy regulation to align profit motives in the direction of efficient processing and distribution of resources. If we are to keep these profit motives at all,7 we need new regulation to align them toward creating software that better serves our society.

**​腾讯低代码OTeam建设概述**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/NMtp0_L4fNWVJprcZrj6Tg  
近年来，低代码/无代码开发热潮又一次袭来，业界对“降本、增效、提质”的声音越来越强。国外有西门子Mendix，微软PowerPlatform等大厂的相关低代码产品，国内有阿里的易搭，Ivx，腾讯的微搭等低代码产品，甚至公司内的低代码产品和平台就有数十种以上。我们在建设低代码产品平台的同时，能否将低代码领域公共、核心的这些能力沉淀和抽离出来，统一提供给业务团队使用呢？我们又该从哪些方面入手去建设这样的公共能力？本文将针对这些问题从公司低代码OTeam的建设层面做简单阐述。另附：[阿里云+钉钉+低代码，或许是To B互联网的正确打开方式](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/MBfaN1sNHOSW3KoRCw5jwQ)、[Stripe Goes No-Code — Stripe Payment Links Explained](https://www.swyx.io/stripe-payment-links/)。

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVWVr_T7kQ0  
Node-RED is a browser-based ‘flow’ programming environment that uses Node.js under the hood and is particularly popular in enterprise IoT systems but works at small scale too. This hour long screencast presents a thorough introduction into really using it productively.

**How we went from supporting 50 languages to all of them**  
https://blog.replit.com/nix  
At Replit, we want to give our users the most powerful, flexible, and easy-to-get-started coding environment. However, it has been limiting because we only support a fixed set of languages and OS packages, some of which are outdated. Ideally, users should be able to use any language and install any package with minimal fuss.

**GraphQL vs DQL**  
https://dgraph.io/blog/post/graphql-vs-dql/  
Dgraph is the world’s first (and only at this time) native GraphQL database. While this statement may sound oxymoronic to some, it tells a story of the advancements made by Dgraph Labs and their journey to becoming the #1 graph database. Dgraph just celebrated 16K Github stargazers, almost doubling that of its closest competition.

**Rethinking Postgres in a Post-Server World**  
https://css-tricks.com/rethinking-postgres-in-a-post-server-world/  
While Cosmos DB gives us a lot of flexibility in terms of what database we use, it still leaves us with many decisions and is not completely free of operational overhead. Fauna has made it so you don’t have to compromise on ACID transactions, relational modeling or normalized data — while still alleviating all the operational overhead of database management. Fauna is a complete rethinking of a database that is truly free of operational overhead. By combining the best of the past with the needs of the future Fauna has built a solution that behaves more like a data API and feels natural in a serverless future.

https://www.fastly.com/blog/quic-is-now-rfc-9000  
The IETF just published QUIC as RFC 9000, supported by RFC 9001, RFC 9002, and RFC 8999. That means QUIC version 1 is officially formalized, and QUIC deployments will now move away from using temporary draft versions to the newly minted version 1. (HTTP/3, the version of HTTP that runs on QUIC, is following closely behind, and should be published soon.) This news is a big deal, both for the IETF and for the internet ecosystem.

https://css-tricks.com/awesome-standalone-web-components/  
In my opinion, Web Components still have a ways to go to be compelling to most developers, but they are getting there. One thing that I think will push their adoption along is the incredibly easy DX of pre-built components thanks to, in part, ES Modules and how easy it is to import JavaScript.

内卷involution，与之对应的是evolution，即演化。直观地说，内卷就是“向内演化，或绕圈圈”。更宽泛一点说，所有无实质意义的消耗都可称为内卷。生活中许许多多低水平重复的工作，貌似精益求精，大家都按部就班，埋头苦干，乐此不疲，但只在有限的内部范围施展，不向外扩张，工作方向是向内收敛的，而不是向外发散的，这就叫内卷。试以7个大家熟悉的事例来作解。
