**3 Truths of Software Projects**  
https://spin.atomicobject.com/2021/07/11/3-truths-software-projects/  
Truth #1: If it’s good, it’s never done; Truth #2: You’ll know more tomorrow; Truth #3: If you want to go fast, increase the quality. Releated: [Creating a “Testing is Fun” Mindset and Learning from Bugs](https://spin.atomicobject.com/2021/07/10/testing-is-fun-mindset/), [Best practices for writing code comments](https://stackoverflow.blog/2021/07/05/best-practices-for-writing-code-comments/).

**npm audit: Broken by Design**  
https://overreacted.io/npm-audit-broken-by-design/  
The way npm audit works is broken. Its rollout as a default after every npm install was rushed, inconsiderate, and inadequate for the front-end tooling.

**Time to say goodbye - Enzyme.js**  
https://www.piotrstaniow.pl/goodbye-enzyme  
There are however many more companies in the world using React, and they would vastly benefit from ditching Enzyme too! Let's have an honest discussion about how the React world has changed in past 5 years, and why Enzyme should be deprecated.

**Data Structure Visualizations**  
https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/Algorithms.html  
The best way to understand complex data structures is to see them in action. We've developed interactive animations for a variety of data structures and algorithms. Our visualization tool is written in javascript using the HTML5 canvas element, and run in just about any modern browser -- including iOS devices like the iPhone and iPad, and even the web browser in the Kindle! (The frame rate is low enough in the Kindle that the visualizations aren't terribly useful, but the tree-based visualizations -- BSTs and AVL Trees -- seem to work well enough). Check the Algorithms menu for all of the latest javascript implementations.

**这是最「没意思」的一届 AI 大会，但大佬们说这就对了**  
http://www.geekpark.net/news/281140  
https://www.worldaic.com.cn/  
在目前的 AI 领域，算力这条腿很粗，运用场景这条腿很细。 我们越来越感觉到，一个全新的人工智能社会即将到来。AI 技术与物理世界不同的人群、场景结合，让其不经意间融入到社会的脉络中，人工智能技术带来的便利，也终将演变成为人与社会的一种『下意识』，在这方面，我一直抱有坚定的信心。在我们真正了解机器的能力之前，我们必须对它有一些经验。我们可能需要多年时间才能适应新的可能性，但我不明白为什么它不能进入通常由人类智力覆盖的任何一个领域，并最终在平等条件下竞争。

**TypeScript and native ESM on Node.js**  
https://2ality.com/2021/06/typescript-esm-nodejs.html  
In this blog post, I’ll explain everything you need to know in order to use and produce native ECMAScript modules on Node.js.

**Exploring the Possibilities of Node’s Virtual Machine Module**

**聊聊中后台前端应用：模块相关的一些事**  
https://ourai.ws/posts/things-about-modules-in-frontend-projects/  
在《聊聊中后台前端应用：目录结构划分模式》中讲述了「野生」、「分层」和「模块化」这三种划分目录结构的模式，本文就在假定项目中已经采用内聚性相对最高的「模块化」模式进行目录结构划分的基础上，聊聊模块相关的一些事儿。

**`export default thing` is different to `export { thing as default }`**  
https://jakearchibald.com/2021/export-default-thing-vs-thing-as-default/  
Dominic Elm DM'd me on Twitter to ask me questions about circular dependencies, and, well, I didn't know the answer. After some testing, discussion, and *ahem* chatting to the V8 team, we figured it out, but I learned something new about JavaScript along the way. I'm going to leave the circular dependency stuff to the end of the article, as it isn't totally related. 

**Webmentions, A Healthier Analytics**  
https://atthis.link/blog/2021/analytics.html  
The truth of the matter is that you don't need analytics to see where your post is being discussed, you just need Webmentions. This easy to implement technology automatically alerts you when your site is mentioned elsewhere online. Regardless of platform. If someone links to your site or gives feedback elsewhere, you'll get an alert. Webmentions is among my favourite web technologies as it offers a far more motivating way of seeing how your site is doing. 

**Functional, Declarative Audio Applications**  
https://www.nickwritesablog.com/functional-declarative-audio-applications/  
Elementary is a JavaScript runtime for writing native audio applications, as well as a library and framework for composing audio signal processes. This is a tool heavily inspired by React.js with which you can write a complete audio DSP application, whether you're targeting web, desktop, mobile, embedded linux, or any of the various native plugin formats for integrating into a modern DAW.

**Why you should choose Aurelia over React (mostly)**  
https://ilikekillnerds.com/2021/07/why-you-should-choose-aurelia-over-react/  
I don’t want this to be a “let’s bash React” article because it’s not. This article aims to point out that while React might be the most popular option, it’s not always the best option. The truth is most front-end developers could not give you a valid reason for why they use React over something that might be better suited. The best you will get is, “it’s the most popular option.”

**Designing a Dataflow Editor with TypeScript and React**  
https://research.protocol.ai/blog/2021/designing-a-dataflow-editor-with-typescript-and-react/  
These topics all deal with the external interface and TypeScript typings; lower-level implementation challenges (like optimizing drag interactions and sharing state between React and D3) have been left to a future post.

**A Look at Building with Astro**  
https://css-tricks.com/a-look-at-building-with-astro/  
Astro is a brand new framework for building websites. To me, the big thing is that it allows you to build a site like you’re using a JavaScript framework (and you are), but the output is a zero-JavaScript static site. You can opt-in to client-side JavaScript as needed, and there are clever options for doing so. Notably, the learning curve is somewhat flattened by the fact that it supports componentry you may already know: React/Preact (JSX), Svelte, Vue, or web components.

**Speeding Up the Webcola Graph Viz Library with Rust + WebAssembly**  
https://cprimozic.net/blog/speeding-up-webcola-with-webassembly/  
This is the story of how I took the initial unoptimized graph visualization - which ran at <10 FPS on my powerful desktop - and optimized it to run at well over 60 FPS, even on weaker mobile devices. I was inspired by this HTTP server performance tuning writeup and kept track of the changes I made and their impact in a similar way. Releated: [Compiling Rust is NP-hard](https://niedzejkob.p4.team/rust-np/).

**Everything Useful I Know About kubectl**  
https://www.atomiccommits.io/everything-useful-i-know-about-kubectl/  
kubectl is self-documenting, which is another reason why it’s 100x better than a UI. If you’re confused about some command, just do k `<command>` --help. e.g. k label --help. There will be lots of examples in the help docs.

**Is everyone starting to work like a developer?**  
https://stackoverflow.blog/2021/07/09/podcast-355-is-everyone-starting-to-work-like-a-developer/  
As most knowledge works goes remote, the asynchronous, merge-driven processes pioneered by developers are becoming widespread.

**The Koyeb Serverless Engine: from Kubernetes to Nomad, Firecracker, and Kuma**  
https://www.koyeb.com/blog/the-koyeb-serverless-engine-from-kubernetes-to-nomad-firecracker-and-kuma  
We wrote this blog post to explain why we moved from Kubernetes to a custom stack to power our users' serverless workloads. This post is written from our point of view as a cloud service provider.

**Building the future of collaborative coding**

We're excited to announce two new features that make collaborating on Replit even easier: Observation Mode and Filetree Presence!

**How we’re creating a threat model framework that works for GitLab**  
https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2021/07/09/creating-a-threat-model-that-works-for-gitlab/  
This is the first in a series of three blog posts where we discuss threat modeling and how we’re using it at GitLab to help secure our product, our company, and most importantly our customer’s data. As usual, we’re doing things a bit differently, but when you hear why it will make a lot of sense

**Against SQL**  
https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/against-sql/  
The core message that I want people to take away is that there is potentially a huge amount of value to be unlocked by replacing SQL, and more generally in rethinking where and how we draw the lines between databases, query languages and programming languages.

**What is a “Databaseless” (DBLess) Architecture, and Why It’s the Future**  
https://redislabs.com/blog/dbless-architecture-and-why-its-the-future/  
DBLess architecture provides a new approach to data pipeline and backend architecture. Just like the terms serverless, stateless, and NoSQL, it attempts to provide more options for architects to think about.

**Write a time-series database engine from scratch**  
https://nakabonne.dev/posts/write-tsdb-from-scratch/  
This blog post walks you through how to implement a time-series database engine based on what I’ve learned from my experience of writing a lightweight one from scratch.


While there are many resources to help programmers write better code—such as books and static analyzers—there are few for writing better comments. While it's easy to measure the quantity of comments in a program, it's hard to measure the quality, and the two are not necessarily correlated. A bad comment is worse than no comment at all. Here are some rules to help you achieve a happy.
