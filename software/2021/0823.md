**研发效能度量引发的血案**

优秀的度量体系设计对目标会有很强的正向牵引作用，不恰当的度量体系往往会引发一场“腥风血雨”。另附：[量化设计目标为何会成为行动阻碍力？](https://www.uisdc.com/goals-and-action)。

**Jamstack CMS: The Past, The Present and The Future**  
https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/08/history-future-jamstack-cms/  
The story of Jamstack CMSs goes all the way back to the 90s. In this article, we take a trip down memory lane to see how we got to the modern Jamstack CMSs we have today, and where they’re heading in the next decade.

**The State of Mobile First and Desktop First**  
https://ishadeed.com/article/the-state-of-mobile-first-and-desktop-first/  
In this article, I will explore with you what each method means, and I will try to discover and see if it’s still relevant for today, along with some tips for responsive design today.

**From a Single Repo, to Multi-Repos, to Monorepo, to Multi-Monorepo**  
https://css-tricks.com/from-a-single-repo-to-multi-repos-to-monorepo-to-multi-monorepo/  
Let me take you on the journey of how this took place, explaining why and when I felt I had to switch to a new approach. The journey consists of four stages (so far!) so let’s break it down like that.

**Is there a need for speed in the Cloud?**  
https://blog.scottlogic.com/2021/08/18/hpc-in-cloud.html  
Cloud computing gives software applications the ability to scale up on demand. With sufficient financial resources, enough compute power can be thrown at a (well-written) software application to achieve desirable performance goals. Why then have cloud providers introduced High Performance Computing components (think hardware accelerators, fast network adapters, etc.) into their clouds? If you can already scale vertically (to a large extent) with high-level programming languages, why would you add the complexity of hardware-level programming into the mix?!

**Computer Scientists Discover Limits of Major Research Algorithm**  
https://www.quantamagazine.org/computer-scientists-discover-limits-of-major-research-algorithm-20210817/  
The most widely used technique for finding the largest or smallest values of a math function turns out to be a fundamentally difficult computational problem.

**HTML is Not a Programming Language?**  
https://css-tricks.com/html-is-not-a-programming-language/  
My goal is not to prove that HTML is or is not a programming language, but to show that the three main arguments used for claiming it is not are flawed or incorrect, thus invalidating the conclusion from a logical point of view.

**Smooth and simple page transitions with the shared element transition API**

**Modern web apps without JavaScript bundling or transpiling**

I didn't much care for vanilla JavaScript prior to ES6. Through all of the 2000s, I chased different approaches to avoid writing too much of it. First there was RJS (Ruby-to-JavaScript). Then there was CoffeeScript. Both transpiling approaches that turned more enjoyable-to-write source code into the kind of JavaScript that browsers would execute. It sorta worked. But it was clearly a clutch. A stop-gap while we waited for browsers to understand a better JavaScript. Though for a while  it looked like that might never happen, and we'd forever be stuck with these clutches!

**渲染性能优化的全局视角，教你做的比别人好**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/lHeSXC963L7hIDKo18HR8w  
遇到性能优化的问题，大抵都会从两个方向入手：行业标准优化手段、实际性能瓶颈问题。既能够从先进的模式、方法、套路吸收借鉴，又能够结合实际性能情况设计应对方案，已然是高质量工作的路径了，但是，路上还充斥着各种判断和选择，稍有不慎还是会泥足深陷，走上“要你命 3000 ”的道路。在这条“要你命 3000”的道路上，大体可以分为三个部分：感知、愈合、防腐。

**Creating An Interactive Gantt Chart Component With Vanilla JavaScript**  https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/08/interactive-gantt-chart-component-vanilla-javascript/  
With a Gantt chart, you can visualize schedules and assign tasks. In this article, we will code a Gantt chart as a reusable Web component. We will focus on the architecture of the component, rendering the calendar with CSS Grid and managing the state of the draggable tasks with JavaScript Proxy Objects.

**We had 90% unused CSS because everybody was afraid to touch the old stuff**  
https://css-tricks.com/we-had-90-unused-css-because-everybody-was-afraid-to-touch-the-old-stuff/  
That’s one of the reasons I sometimes like component-based-styling solutions (CSS-in-JS, if you’re nasty). Not because I love complex tooling. Not because I like JavaScript syntax better than CSS. Because of the co-location of styles and componentry. Because nobody is afraid of the styles anymore — they are tightly coupled to what they are styling. It’s not needed on every project, but if you’re building with components anyway (an awfully nice way to architect front-ends that doesn’t require JavaScript), you might as well style this way.

**A Simple Way to Build Collaborative Web Apps**  
https://zjy.cloud/posts/collaborative-web-apps  
By collaborative web app I mean apps with desktop-like interactions and realtime collaborations, such as Notion, Discord, Figma, etc. I want to find an approach suitable for small teams, simple but not necessarily easy, fast by default, and scalable when it grows.

**Video-Touch: Multi-User Remote Robot Control in Google Meet call by DNN-based Gesture Recognition**

**Introducing Spamcheck: A data-driven, anti-abuse engine**  
https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2021/08/19/introducing-spamcheck-data-driven-anti-abuse/  
This tool was designed, tested and integrated by our GitLab Security Automation team (with amazing partnership from our Trust and Safety team and our Create and Plan Engineering Development teams here at GitLab) with the purpose of improving GitLab's resilience to spam and abuse – in respect to both user experience and infrastructure robustness. We're continuing to develop and mature Spamcheck, but this two-part blog series will detail the development of this tool thus far (part one) and the tech stack behind it (part two).

**Service Architecture at SoundCloud — Part 2: Value-Added Services**  
https://developers.soundcloud.com/blog/service-architecture-2  
Unnecessary complexity and duplicate code developed. Even worse, we had business and divergent authorization logic living in each of the BFFs, which is a dangerous pattern, as the maintenance and synchronicity of this code is of paramount importance. It became clear that we needed a different approach: Enter Value-Added Services (VAS).

**Measuring Developer Relations**  
https://www.swyx.io/measuring-devrel/  
DevRel is hot but nobody knows how to measure it. That's because we don't agree on what effective DevRel *is*, and we don't agree on the tradeoffs of lagging vs leading metrics for a creative, unattributable, intimately human endeavor. #dx #devrel #content

**Zero Trust controls for your SaaS applications**

We’re excited to give your team the tools to solve that challenge. With Access in front of your SaaS applications, you can build Zero Trust rules that determine who can reach your SaaS applications in the same place where your rules for self-hosted applications and network access live. 

**Low-Code and No-Code Tools – What Are They?**  
https://www.uxpin.com/studio/blog/low-code-no-code-tools/  
Low code development is also beneficial for UX research and testing. UX designers can create fully functioning prototypes using an LCAP to conduct better user tests before handing designs to engineering teams. This type of low-code workflow could save significant time and money when shipping new products or features.

众所周知，人机交互是一门集调研，构思，设计和测试为一体的学科。作为一门覆盖多领域的多学科，包括并不限于心理学，行为学，编程，工程，设计，调研，和工商管理，现代人机交互的核心已经不再是从技术层面去解决问题， 而是侧重于以多个视角去挖掘问题的本质并思考问题背后的价值。也因此，人机交互学术界一直以来都试图寻找一种思考模式，或者理论模型，去将复杂的思考流程提炼出来。

**Two perspectives on the designer who Steve Jobs could not hire**  
https://www.arun.is/blog/richard-sapper/  
Richard Sapper isn’t a household name like Jony Ive, Dieter Rams, or Phillipe Stark. Yet, his impact on the world earns him a place in the pantheon of design. When Apple was still a fledgling manufacturer of personal computers, Steve Jobs tried to hire him. The job would have required Richard to move from Milan to the Bay Area and abandon his exclusivity contract with IBM, two things he could not do.
