**Thank you, Angular**  
https://blog.angular.io/thank-you-angular-d90d70f2e9d8  
At Google we’ve reached some major milestones recently as well. Angular’s growth has accelerated and has over 2500 applications, and thousands of Googlers using it. Angular has become the most used web solution at Google across all categories we currently track. While we don’t have the exact metrics for this, I do believe it’s safe to say that Angular has impacted billions of people around the world.

**Faster Chrome - Let The Compiler do the work**  
https://blog.chromium.org/2021/12/faster-chrome-let-the-compiler-do-the-work.html  
Chrome is fast, but there's always room for improvement. Often, that's achieved by carefully crafting the algorithms that make up Chrome. But there's a lot of Chrome, so why not let computers do at least some part of our work? In this installment of The Fast And the Curious, we'll show you several changes in how we build Chrome to achieve a 25.8% higher score on Speedometer on Windows and a 22.0% increase in browser responsiveness.

**Writing Maintainable Code is a Communication Skill**  
https://max.engineer/maintainable-code  
Maintainable code is code that eloquently and considerately communicates to its reader how, what, and why it implements.

**The next big evolution in serverless computing**  
https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/serverless/the-next-big-evolution-in-cloud-computing  
The next generation of serverless platforms will need to maintain the core, high-value characteristics of the first generation, things like: Rapid auto-scaling from, and to zero; The option of pay-per-use billing models; Low barriers to entry through simplicity. Looking ahead, serverless platforms will need a much more robust set of capabilities to serve a new, broader range of workloads and customers. Here are the top five trends in serverless platforms that we see for 2022 and beyond. Releated: [Cloudflare Pages Goes Full Stack](https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-pages-goes-full-stack/)  

**Tech Predictions for 2022 and Beyond**  
https://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2021/12/tech-prediction-for-2022-and-beyond.html  
We have reached an inflection point. After AWS pioneered cloud technology more than 15 years ago, cloud infrastructure has evolved to a place where we are seeing all parts of the cloud reach practically anywhere on the planet—and even into space. The cloud has allowed what was once science fiction to become science fact. Models and techniques in the artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) realm have gotten better and better—so much so that we see glimpses of new kinds of use cases emerging that we previously only imagined in movies and comics. We are entering a phase where data is abundant, access to it is almost instantaneous, and our ability to make sense of it in new and subtle ways is practically automatic. But this technology is not replacing humans; it is augmenting how we engage with the world. 2022 will be an exciting year for technology, with it pushing all of us, and our planet, forward in the process.

**Low-code/no-code: why it's the future, not a fad**

**Scaling the Practice of Architecture, Conversationally**  
https://martinfowler.com/articles/scaling-architecture-conversationally.html  
Architecture need not be a monologue; delivered top-down from the minds and mouths of a centralised few. This article describes another way to do architecture; as a series of conversations, driven by a decentralised and empowering decision-making technique, and supported by four learning and alignment mechanisms: Decision Records, Advisory Forum, Team-sourced Principles, and a Technology Radar

**Is SOLID Still Relevant in Modern Software Architecture?**  
https://www.infoq.com/news/2021/11/solid-modern-microservices/  
Other authors have different perspectives regarding microservices. Paulo Merson argues that SOLID principles are good for OOP but do not fully apply to microservices. Therefore, Merson proposes a different set of principles for microservice design: IDEALS. These are: interface segregation, deployability, event-driven, availability over consistency, loose-coupling, and single responsibility.

**Here’s what people in tech had to say about JavaScript when it debuted in 1995**  
https://superhighway.dev/javascript-25-years-1995  
Time and time again JavaScript is crowned the most popular programming language in the World. Whether you agree with that or not, one thing’s for sure: It’s come a long way since its debut back in 1995.

**Firefox is the Only Alternative**  
https://batsov.com/articles/2021/11/28/firefox-is-the-only-alternative/  
Obviously for a proprietary browser it’s pretty hard to assess how it (mis)handles your browsing data. I’m fairly certain that you can have a privacy-respecting browsing experience based on Chromium (we have Brave), but for me that has never been the problem. The problem is having real competition and real alternatives. As it stands today we have a browser duopoly (Chrome and Safari) and pretty much a monopoly outside of Apple’s walled garden. Firefox remains our only real alternative. Remember that next time you decide you don’t care about Chrome slowly eating the web.

**[译]在 Hermes 成为 React Native 默认 JS 引擎的路上**  
https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/440738845  
自 2019 年我们发布 Hermes 以来，它在社区已经获得了越来越多的认可。比如，React Native 应用程序元框架团队 Expo 就在最近宣布了对 Hermes 的实验性 支持，这一度是 Expo 论坛上呼声最高的功能之一。移动端数据库团队 Realm 也在近期对 Hermes 提供了 alpha 支持。本文将重点介绍过去两年以来，我们在推动 Hermes 成为 React Native 最佳 JavaScript 引擎方面取得的最令人兴奋的一些成果。展望未来，我们有信心通过进一步的改进，使 Hermes 成为 React Native 在所有平台上的默认 JavaScript 引擎。

**React folder structure for enterprise level applications**  
https://engineering.udacity.com/react-folder-structure-for-enterprise-level-applications-f8384eff162b  
The goal of this article is to explain the reasoning behind this structure so that you can use these ideas to architect the best solution for your project.

**useEffect sometimes fires before paint**  
https://thoughtspile.github.io/2021/11/15/unintentional-layout-effect/  
useEffect should run after paint to prevent blocking the update. But did you know it’s not really guaranteed to fire after paint? Updating state in useLayoutEffect makes every useEffect from the same render run before paint, effectively turning them into layout effects. Confusing? Let me explain.

**Building a server-driven foundation for mobile app development**  
https://engineeringblog.yelp.com/2021/11/building-a-server-driven-foundation-for-mobile-app-development.html  
In this blog post, we’ll cover the Biz Native Foundation (BNF), which provides a foundation for building, testing, deploying, and monitoring server-driven features in our Biz App. At the end, we’ll share future plans for extending this foundation to our Consumer App.

**Using WebAssembly (created in Rust) for Fast React Components**  
https://www.joshfinnie.com/blog/using-webassembly-created-in-rust-for-fast-react-components/  
With the recent update to Rust, it is time to relook at using Rust and React together. I have a new found love for Rust and everything it can do as a language. One of its more impressive features is its ability to write WebAssembly(Wasm) without much overhead. I have explored how to use Rust to write Wasm before (Blog post coming soon!). But I wanted to see how easy it would be to integrate it into a standard React workflow.

**Exiting the Vietnam of Programming: Our Journey in Dropping the ORM (in Golang)**

**Will Nix Overtake Docker?**  
https://blog.replit.com/nix-vs-docker  
In many discussions about Nix, the comparison of Nix and Docker comes up frequently. This question could be dismissed by saying that Nix and Docker are different tools that solve different problems. One is a toolkit for building and deploying containers and the other is a package and configuration manager. However, these tools do have some overlap: they can both be used to create reproducible environments. A reproducible environment is one that can be recreated from scratch in an identical way (ideally bit-for-bit). Practically, this means having the same tools, versions, and configuration between the environments.

**How to Translate Business Requirements into Code**  
https://sredmond.medium.com/how-to-translate-business-requirements-into-code-d22c7ec134eb  
How does one take business requirements and translate them into technical requirements? If you’re a new team lead or an aspiring team lead, this is something you might think about. As a leader in the development world, you will be asked to attend meetings to receive high-level requirements. Your job will then be to take those high-level requirements and turn them into technical requirements that your developers can then work on. I don’t claim to be the absolute authority on this topic, but I will take you through what has worked for me.

**The big idea around unikernels**  
https://changelog.com/posts/the-big-idea-around-unikernels  
Did you know Linux is approaching 30 years old? Did you know Unix is around 50 years old? I’m not knocking them — I’ve been using Linux since they were distributed on floppies. However, Unix was built for machines like the PDP-7 — you know, the kind that takes up an entire wall. But, have you ever wondered what an operating system built in 2022 would look like? Today, cloud infrastructure is so complex that devops/SRE folks are attracting salaries that sometimes exceed normal software engineers.

**Building a Now Playing Display**  
https://taoofmac.com/space/blog/2021/12/01/1920  
Today’s a bank holiday, so I decided to spend a little while having fun. As it happens, yesterday I came across this neat “Now Playing” desktop display build, and since I have an official 7” Raspberry Pi LCD on my desk for controlling my lights, I decided to do something similar, but to display what’s currently playing on Plex (since I use PlexAmp for my music collection).

**Wikipedia and Apps: A Love Story**  
https://diff.wikimedia.org/2021/11/30/wikipedia-and-apps-a-love-story/  
Wikimedia Foundation’s apps are an essential piece to meet our “this is for everyone” design principle. Wikimedia apps are designed with the philosophy of mobile first in mind. One of the core principles of mobile first is to embrace the constraints of a mobile environment and with it, prioritize essential information, as there’s simply not enough room for everything.

https://medium.com/designing-atlassian/create-accessible-designs-using-the-figma-a11y-annotation-kit-35371f00dac5  
Accessible experiences don’t design themselves. If designers don’t annotate their designs with accessibility properties and behaviors then developers won’t code an accessible experience… and we’ve failed to shift accessibility to the left in the software development life cycle (SDLC).
