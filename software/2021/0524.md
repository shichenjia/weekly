https://blog.google/technology/developers/io-2021/
This year, Google I/O went digital — available for everyone, for free — and was dedicated to showcasing a more helpful Google for all. The event brought together people from around the world for a first look at updates across our products, including new milestones in AI, helpful features in Android, Photos and Maps, and ways we’re building with security and privacy in mind. Here are more details about everything we announced this year.

https://origami.kosmulski.org/blog/2021-05-16-building-personal-origami-website-2021  
In early 2021, I rebuilt my website at origami.kosmulski.org from scratch. It was a complete redesign which started with planning what I wanted the site to be and who its intended audience was, followed by looking at a few potential technologies, checking them out and choosing one, building the site, and tuning its load times and SEO. While a few details are specific to origami, most are completely general and should be interesting to anyone planning to create their personal web page, regardless of topic.
