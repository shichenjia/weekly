**How many happy users did your product have this month?**  
https://christianheilmann.com/2021/07/15/how-many-happy-users-did-your-product-have-this-month/  
We need a new metric of happy users. But I am still at a loss how to get to that one. One thing I know though is that chasing more users or interactions for the sake of growth doesn’t make better products.

**Sharing our Engineering Career Framework with the world**  
https://dropbox.tech/infrastructure/sharing-our-engineering-career-framework-with-the-world  
https://dropbox.github.io/dbx-career-framework/  
At Dropbox, we strive to be a great place for all engineers to grow and be recognized for that growth. Our Engineering Career Framework helps keep us accountable there and is viewable by anyone within the company. Today, we are also making it viewable by anyone outside the company.

**Give me /events, not webhooks**  
https://blog.syncinc.so/events-not-webhooks  
Webhooks are intended to eliminate or reduce the need to constantly poll for data. But in my experience, webhooks come with a few challenges. In general, you can't rely on webhooks alone to keep two systems consistent. Every integration I've ever worked on has realized this fact by eventually augmenting webhooks with polling. This is due to a few problem areas.

**WriteFreely**  
https://writefreely.org/  
An open source platform for building a writing space on the web. WriteFreely powers tens of thousands of individual blogs, and hundreds of communities. WriteFreely is stubbornly focused on being a truly simple blogging platform, doing more than other platforms to help you focus, write, and publish your thoughts.

## 深阅读

**Learning from the real world: A hardware hobby project**  
https://stackoverflow.blog/2021/07/12/the-difference-between-software-and-hardware-projects/  
If you think your software experience will let you build a hardware project easily, you might be a bit too ambitious. It's very different from software.

***Designing for the Unexpected**  
https://alistapart.com/article/designing-for-the-unexpected/  
Your company’s survival is tied to the ability of the products it makes to work in situations you haven’t imagined, and on devices that don’t yet exist — Jeffrey Zeldman. I’m not sure when I first heard this quote, but it’s something that has stayed with me over the years. How do you create services for situations you can’t imagine? Or design products that work on devices yet to be invented?

**Intro to Web Components: Vanilla JS**  
https://unicorn-utterances.com/posts/intro-to-web-components-vanilla-js/  
In this article, we’ll touch on what web components are, how we can build them without a framework, and some limitations to keep in mind during development. Later, in a follow-up article, we’ll show how a lightweight framework (such as Lit) can provide quality-of-life improvements for those looking to build larger scale applications.

**Angular is Costing Companies Billions**  
https://javascript.plainenglish.io/enough-why-its-time-to-rip-out-angular-7d831802c8a2  
The Holy Grail of writing code, any code, lies within its simplicity. However, as modern engineers, we’ve all but totally lost sight of that simplicity. We’ve gotten caught up in the fad of whatever shiny new tech has gotten released from which ever fav tech giant or college has shoved in our face as “state-of-the-art”.

**聊聊中后台前端应用：业务中的组件体系**  
https://ourai.ws/posts/the-system-of-ui-components-in-frontend-projects/  
普通的组件通用性很差，也就是说，它基本只能用于某个特定的系统且不能被替换。有一种组件，它是基于标准化的接口规范开发出来的，能用在任何对接了该接口的系统，也能被任何符合该接口规范的组件替换——它就是「可交换组件」，就像制造业所使用的「标准件」。可交换的 UI 组件是前端 GUI 开发从手工作坊到自动装配的关键所在。

**Python 与 Excel 终于互通了**  
https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/386285754  
很多开发者说自从有了 Python/Pandas，Excel 都不怎么用了，用它来处理与可视化表格非常快速。但是这样还是有一大缺陷，操作不是可视化的表格，因此对技能要求更高一点。近日，开发者构建了名为 Grid studio 的开源项目，它是一个基于网页的表格应用，完全结合了 Python 和 Excel 的优势。另附：[Why do we use R rather than Excel](https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2021/07/why-do-we-use-r-rather-than-excel/)。

**低门槛游戏制作工具漫谈（第一节） -- 任天堂《Game Builder Garage》**  
https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/387971740  
这篇专题初看时，与低代码看似并无任何联系，但是深入分析后会发现，游戏制作工具与低代码平台之间诸多的共通之处。在对谈中，不穷详细介绍了钉钉如何从一个办公应用，进化到 to B 领域企业和组织数字化的管理工具，再到现在联合生态，向所有组织开放数字化能力的平台的转变。不穷认为，数字化能够在未来让组织变得更加透明，释放每个个体的创造力，这在本质上是「反内卷」的。同时，企业的数字化一定是「齐头并进」，上下游共同进行，单个企业的数字化只会形成「数字孤岛」。

**SolidJS硬气的说：我比React还react**  
https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/385841019  
本文会比较SolidJS与React的异同，阐述他的独特优势，看完后不知道你会不会和我发出同样的感叹：这简直比React还react（react译为响应）。相信看完本文后，不仅能认识一个新框架，还能对React有更深的认识。

**The Ultimate Guide to Browser-Side Storage**  
https://blog.openreplay.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-browser-side-storage  
It’s usually necessary to store user data server side in a database or similar repository. This guarantees persistence and ensures users can access their data from any web-connected browser (presuming your storage system is reliable, of course!)

**One React mistake that's slowing you down**  
https://epicreact.dev/one-react-mistake-thats-slowing-you-down/  
One thing that I like about React is that it allows me to write my components like little black boxes of abstraction. I can look at a design and draw lines around the UI elements and I know the components that I'm going to be making.

**Not All Components Are Created Equal**  
https://formidable.com/blog/2021/react-components/  
We used to argue about dividing our components into categories, until we renounced this pattern as a community. But what if we missed out on valuable lessons about what makes our components more comprehensible?

**Towards richer colors on the Web**  
https://darker.ink/writings/Towards-richer-colors-on-the-Web  
This article will talk about the ongoing efforts to specify richer colors on the Web platform, plus some ideas about directions for future development on Blink/Chromium.

**How WhatsApp enables multi-device capability**  
https://engineering.fb.com/2021/07/14/security/whatsapp-multi-device/  
For years, people have been asking us to create a true multi-device experience that allows people to use WhatsApp on other devices without requiring a smartphone connection. Today, we’re announcing the rollout of a limited public beta test for WhatsApp’s updated multi-device capability. 

**How Airbnb Measures Future Value to Standardize Tradeoffs**

The propensity score matching model powering how we optimize for long-term decision-making

**Modeling an Instagram clone using GraphQL and Dgraph Cloud**  
https://dgraph.io/blog/post/modeling-instagram-clone/  
In this article, our aim is to make a backend that can be used to power an Instagram clone application. We’ll start simple and small in order to build up some core principles of data modeling and how to do so within Dgraph Cloud.

**Updating the Go Memory Model**  
https://research.swtch.com/gomm  
This post restates Go's overall philosophy and the current memory model and then outlines the relatively small adjustments I believe that we should make to the Go memory model. It assumes the background presented in the earlier posts “Hardware Memory Models” and “Programming Language Memory Models.”

**From symbols to AI pair programmers**  
https://changelog.com/practicalai/140  
How did we get from symbolic AI to deep learning models that help you write code (i.e., GitHub and OpenAI’s new Copilot)? That’s what Chris and Daniel discuss in this episode about the history and future of deep learning (with some help from an article recently published in ACM and written by the luminaries of deep learning).

**Why we will win the war for general-purpose computing**  
https://cheapskatesguide.org/articles/war-on-gp-computing-farnell.html  
Dr. Andy Farnell is a regular reader of the Cheapskate's Guide. When he read "Taking a Stand in the War on General-Purpose Computing" in February, he felt it was too pessimistic. So, he decided to write his own article to give his perspective. This is his article.

**The unreasonable effectiveness of just showing up everyday**  
https://typesense.org/blog/the-unreasonable-effectiveness-of-just-showing-up-everyday/  
With no self-imposed time pressure, I was able to focus on just one thing: showing up every day and writing some code. Some features took an hour to implement, some took several hours spread over days, some even stretched into weeks, but it did not matter because there were no deadlines of any sort.

**Goodbye, Fleets**  
https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/product/2021/goodbye-fleets  
We built Fleets as a lower-pressure, ephemeral way for people to share their fleeting thoughts. We hoped Fleets would help more people feel comfortable joining the conversation on Twitter. But, in the time since we introduced Fleets to everyone, we haven’t seen an increase in the number of new people joining the conversation with Fleets like we hoped. Because of this, on August 3, Fleets will no longer be available on Twitter. Releated: [Twitter is Killing a Big Feature, Fleets. More Products Should Do the Same](https://onezero.medium.com/twitter-is-killing-a-big-feature-fleets-why-more-products-should-do-the-same-48a12f16462e).

**想要离开互联网，最好是在10年前，其次是现在**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/xzA47ST5tEN2e9M2K-Ys0w  
随着互联网的拓展与加深，我们能感受到互联网的一些晦暗面也相伴而生：信息过载和好友关系庞杂，加重了现代人的焦虑和负担；身在人群，目光却在手机屏幕，出现了“群体性孤独”；永远在线，碎片化生存，真实生活备受分心所扰。近年来，越来越多人喊着“”逃离互联网”“社交网络斋戒”和“互联网排毒”，并且声音越来大，那让我们来看看那些逃离互联网的人，他们的生活是什么样，后来都怎么了？

**任正非与华为是如何看待和防止内卷的**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/vee7-I0DAoDGJflDYI-qaA  
长期被任总高度关注的问题可以归纳为一句话，这就是：“方向大致正确，组织要充满活力”。任总认为这是“华为长期成功的法宝”“战略是明确公司发展方向，真正实现目标是靠组织活力”。正如任总在2017年6月的一次讲话中所指出的那样：“一个公司取得成功有两个关键：方向要大致正确，组织要充满活力。”前者是战略问题，后者是管理问题。另附：[从取消大小周，联想到互联网英雄主义时代的落幕](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/O-aTvcT0rdrwqa476gW9NA)。

**服务机器人行业正在大爆发**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/EaLHkJujnPEI88w64rF8OA  
服务机器人的风口已经到来，服务机器人成本开始急剧下降，产品开始达到了实用，越来越多中小企业愿意为服务机器人买单，这印证了服务机器人行业正在大爆发。我认为服务机器人硬件的定义已经完成，后面拼的就是软件和智能化。在垂直、重复、定义清楚的劳动岗位，服务机器人完全可以胜任工作。在这个领域，我们要做服务机器人的“蓝翔技校”。

**尴尬的KPI**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/Sgofmevtv9sdO8X6OUQVvA  
OKR和KPI大同小异。它们没有本质区别，只是在细节上有点差别。今天很多人学习谷歌，把谷歌的OKR当做唯一正确的灵丹妙药，一吃下去百病全消。但其实，它只是普通的维生素而已。每家公司都在吃维生素，关键不是你要吃哪一种维生素，而是你要坚持吃、按时吃，坚持做正确的事。不要期待自己能获得一种灵丹妙药，吃下去就能马上成功。这个世界上哪有什么灵丹妙药，所谓的灵丹妙药，换一个词，其实就是不劳而获。
