**突破web 应用研发效能的叹息之墙**  
https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/370441727  
这篇文章可以看做是《长夜未央——企业级研发提效的下一阶段》的后续。相比两年前只是架构思路和局部的技术积累，随着240 计划 的推进，我对架构中关键部分做了更详尽可执行的设计。并且以上线一个真实社区类产品为目标，完成了”最小化“的实现。同时这一两年我还做了一些质量、项目管理相关的工作，这些经验给了我更全面的视角去看待”技术架构如何结合团队职能等方面的改进来进一步突破 web 研发中的效能瓶颈“这一问题。这篇文章的内容分成两个部分：对架构的关键部分的详细设计以及实现；架构对对工程质量、项目管理产生的意义。希望能为读者提供一些启发。附：[软件开发提效哪有那么容易](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/370490326)，[在提赋能之前先想想这5个问题](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/370832699)。

**建立元数据驱动的前端架构**  
https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/370499228  
在广义的前端领域，模型驱动视图已经不是什么新鲜话题了，“低代码”和“搭建”也炙手可热，而这些概念都是以增强应用系统的可配置性为前提的。在这个大前提下，建立元数据驱动的前端架构就变得很重要了。本次分享的目标是希望从零开始，初步建立一个小小的元数据驱动的原型系统（暂时只包括前端部分），并以此介绍这套系统与业务领域的可能结合方式。

**How we use Web Components at GitHub**  
https://github.blog/2021-05-04-how-we-use-web-components-at-github/  
Like many front-end codebases, we leverage components, independent, isolated, and reusable pieces of code that allow application teams to deliver high fidelity UI quickly and efficiently while still keeping to our high standards of quality. We’re using Web Components in a big way at GitHub. We have over a dozen open-source Web Components and with dozens more that are closed source.

**Why Is Cloud Infrastructure So Complicated?**  
https://somehowmanage.com/2021/05/06/why-is-cloud-infrastructure-so-complicated/  
How did cloud infrastructure get so complicated? Why is AWS such a hot mess of insane configurability and complexity? I ponder this a lot. As a manager of software teams, any minute not spent on building an awesome product kills me a little.

**Querying a petabyte of cloud storage in 10 minutes**  
https://www.elastic.co/cn/blog/querying-a-petabyte-of-cloud-storage-in-10-minutes  
Elastic's new frozen data tier decouples compute from storage and leverages low-cost object stores such as Google Cloud Storage, Azure Blob Storage, or Amazon S3 to directly power searches. It provides unlimited scaling of storage while preserving the ability to efficiently query the data without any need to rehydrate it first, making it easier and cheaper to manage data at scale. In this blog post we compare search performance on the new frozen tier with the existing Elasticsearch data tiers, and we show how with the frozen tier you can store and search far larger amounts of data at lower performance.

**Hosting SQLite databases on Github Pages**  
https://phiresky.github.io/blog/2021/hosting-sqlite-databases-on-github-pages/  
Hosting a static website is much easier than a "real" server - there’s many free and reliable options (like GitHub, GitLab Pages, Netlify, etc), and it scales to basically infinity without any effort. So I wrote a tool to be able to use a real SQL database in a statically hosted website!

**The Evolution of UX at GitLab**  
https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2021/05/04/the-evolution-of-ux-at-gitlab/  
Since hiring our first designer at GitLab in 2014, there have been numerous milestones for the product and our organization. It's easy to get lost in the day-to-day and lose sight of the accomplishments that brought us to where we are today, so let's look back to remind ourselves of how far we've come.

**从目标到工具再到方法，十年产品人的知识管理体系**  
https://sspai.com/post/66474  
我的背包里面有一把朋友送的瑞士军刀，功能非常多，但是我使用最频繁的其实是用它来拆快递。并非是不知道这把刀能做别的事情，而是在生活中缺少使用的情境。思维工具亦是如此。日常经常看到许多基于产品功能的讨论，以至于许多新上手的用户也被带到了这个漩涡中，试图寻找到一个「完美」的工具，然后才开始动手建立自己的知识体系。任何工具的使用，不取决于工具本身的丰富程度，而取决于我们的情境和需求。本文无意讨论工具的好坏之分，更多的是希望通过一个具体的案例，提供一种「思维上的工具」，来看到底该在什么情境下，使用哪些工具来解决自己的问题。与其关注功能，不如多问自己要解决的核心问题是什么。
