**A year of transformation: The web and the world**  
https://www.w3.org/blog/2021/03/a-year-of-transformation-the-web-and-the-world/  
Today we mark a yearly celebration, that of the invention of the Web in March 1989 by our Director Sir Tim Berners-Lee. Releated: [To build a better world from the Covid crisis, we need a global push to connect the world’s young people](https://webfoundation.org/2021/03/web-birthday-32/).

**The Death of a Node.js Process**  
https://thomashunter.name/posts/2021-03-08-the-death-of-a-nodejs-process  
This post is based on content from my recently published book, Distributed Systems with Node.js. If you're interested in building Node.js services, especially those that interact with external systems, then I highly recommend checking it out. It contains a wealth of information, and this post provides but a tiny taste.

**Infrastructure as code: Create and configure infrastructure elements in seconds**  
https://stackoverflow.blog/2021/03/08/infrastructure-as-code-create-and-configure-infrastructure-elements-in-seconds/  
IaC allows developers to supply IT environments with multiple lines of code and can be deployed in a matter of minutes (in contrast to manual infrastructure, which can take hours if not days to be deployed).

**Write libraries instead of services, where possible**  
http://catern.com/services.html  
By avoiding the maintenance and upgrade costs of a service, a library can afford to contain more functionality. That's good for both the developer and the user.

**Nodes is your thinking space for exploring ideas with code**  
https://nodes.io/  
What if programming was about ideas, not semicolons? Compose, abstract, generalise. Start from top down or bottom up and refine as you go. With Nodes, programming feels like sketching on a canvas. Zoom in and out of problems, experiment on the side and easily re-use parts of other projects. Nodes is created by variable.io, a generative design and data visualisation studio.

**我对 Svelte 的看法**  
https://lutaonan.com/blog/svelte/  
我在很早前已经听说过 Svelte, 但是一直没有机会在新的项目真正地用上。最近在尝试模仿实现一个 Roam Research 的编辑器，考虑到可能会有大量和 DOM 交互的逻辑，所以我趁这个机会选择了 Svelte, 目前这个编辑器的已经完成了大部分的功能，开源在 https://github.com/djyde/plastic-editor . 在开发的过程中我对 Svelte 非常满意，这篇文章打算就我的体验来说说我对 Svelte 的一些看法。

**Compressing data with Parquet**  
https://dev.l1x.be/posts/2021/03/08/compressing-data-with-parquet/  
Many times I see that people use Sqlite for distributing large datasets. When the use case is analytical (OLAP), there are often better options. We are going to investigate how much better we could do if we use something other than Sqlite. To make sure, I love Sqlite and use it a lot when a simple SQL single file database does it. For this particular use case, I think using [Parquet](http://parquet.apache.org/) is better suited. We are going to explore why.

**Navigate your code like it's 2021**

**Chromebook turns 10: Looking back and moving forward**  
https://blog.google/products/chromebooks/chromebook-turns-10/  
10 years ago, computing was complicated. Slow boot times, clunky hardware and intrusive updates were the norm. Computers were invented before the internet, and they hadn’t fully caught up to how people were using the web. So Google set out to design something new. The idea was to create a cloud-first experience that was fast, secure and easy to use — with software that stays up-to-date, automatically. A computer that boots up in seconds, and stays fast over time.
