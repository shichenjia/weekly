**What goes into curl**  
https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2021/06/16/what-goes-into-curl/  
curl is a command line tool and library for doing Internet data transfers. It has been around for a loooong time (over 23 years) but there is still a flood of new things being added to it and development being made, to take it further and to keep it relevant today and in the future. I’m the lead developer and head maintainer of the curl project. How do we decide what goes into curl? And perhaps more importantly, what does not get accepted into curl? Let’s look how this works in the curl factory.

**Utopia, a visual design tool for React, with code as the source of truth**  
https://utopia.app/  
We’re announcing the alpha version of Utopia, a design and coding environment for React projects and components that runs in the browser. It combines VSCode with a design and preview tool, and full two-way synchronisation: design and code update each other, in real time. And unlike any design tool out there, it uses React code as the source of truth.

**Why you should consider using Svelte**  
https://medium.com/geekculture/why-you-should-consider-using-svelte-b1268140e481  
This week I decided to give Svelte a go and build an app. I wanted to answer a few questions, namely, what is it? What does it bring to the table? Should you consider it for your next project? I’ve never used Svelte before so this will be a learning experience for me as well. This will be part 1 in a 2 part series of my journey into learning Svelte. I wanted to do this all in 1 post but I feel like I have too much to write…

**How Much Testing is Enough?**  
https://testing.googleblog.com/2021/06/how-much-testing-is-enough.html  
A familiar question every software developer and team grapples with is, “How much testing is enough to qualify a software release?” A lot depends on the type of software, its purpose, and its target audience.

**Setting up a Decentralised Website (ENS + IPFS = dWeb)**  
https://bitsofco.de/setting-up-a-decentralised-website/  
One thing that I’ve been really into lately has been ENS names. As someone who’s already obsessed with buying domain names, ENS names have been an even greater obsession (mostly because of emoji names, like ✊🏾✊🏾✊🏾.eth)! So what are ENS names, exactly? And what is a “decentralised website”? Releated: [OpenSea stores NFTs with IPFS and Filecoin](https://blog.ipfs.io/2021-06-17-opensea-ipfs-filecoin/).

https://2ality.com/2021/06/error-cause.html

It describes a feature where instances of Error can optionally specify that they were caused by another error.

**History of the Web: Part 1**

Forgive me if I skip the wonderful stories of Macromedia Flash, Java in the browser, or whatever other detour you can think of. While those were important to development of the web, most of us will never run into them again.

**纯CSS实现标题栏、表格头水平滚动垂直不滚动**  
https://www.zhangxinxu.com/wordpress/2021/06/css-scroll-sticky/  
有些报表会很宽，浏览器水平放不下，需要水平滚动显示，这个可以设置overflow-y:hidden实现，很基本的实现，没什么难度。但是，如果同时希望垂直滚动的时候，表格头是固定的。此时该如何实现呢？此时，使用传统的position:fixed定位是不行的，因为此时水平滚动也会纹丝不动。此时可以试试position:sticky粘性定位试试。

**When CSS Isn’t Enough: JavaScript Requirements For Accessible Components**  
https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/06/css-javascript-requirements-accessible-components/  
Spoiler alert: tooltips, modals, tabs, carousels, and dropdown menus are some of the user interface components that require more than CSS. To ensure accessibility of your interface, JavaScript is a necessary addition to accomplish focus management, respond to keyboard events, and toggle ARIA attributes.

**Explicit ESM in Node.js with .mjs**  
https://dev.to/bnb/explicit-esm-in-node-js-with-mjs-3ooh  
There are a number of different components of Node.js that have been intentionally structured to allow you to use standard (as in, how the ECMAScript Specification defines it) ESM by default and extend/augment that experience if you'd like to. Today, I want to get into one of the baisc elements of ESM in Node.js: the .mjs and .cjs extensions.

**A Visual Guide to NodeJS Streams**  
https://blog.insiderattack.net/a-visual-guide-to-nodejs-streams-9d2d594a9bf5  
In NodeJS, stream module provides the capability to work with streams. Even if you haven’t used stream module explicitly there are a lots of underlying functionality in NodeJS applications which use streams. “Streams” is an easy concept, but it may sound very complex if you are unfamiliar with it. Therefore, I thought of describing a few key concepts in NodeJS streams in visuals so that it can be easily understood.

**Benchmarking JavaScript Memory Usage**  
https://blog.webpagetest.org/posts/benchmarking-javascript-memory-usage/  
And because we don't have better tooling or metrics...well, you can probably see the circular logic here. It's a chicken or the egg problem. The first issue, not knowing the business impact, is gonna require a lot of individual sites doing the work of adding memory tracking to their RUM data and connecting the dots. The second problem, not having benchmarks, is something we can start to fix.

**Just How Niche is Headless WordPress?**  
https://css-tricks.com/just-how-niche-is-headless-wordpress/  
I wonder where headless WordPress will land. And by “headless” I mean only using the WordPress admin and building out the user-facing site through the WordPress REST API rather than the traditional WordPress theme structure. Is it… big? The future of WordPress? Or relatively niche?

**Network hose: Managing uncertain network demand with model simplicity**  
https://engineering.fb.com/2021/06/15/data-infrastructure/network-hose/  
To meet service bandwidth expectations we need an accurate long-term demand forecast. However, because of the nature of our services, the fluidity of the workloads, and the difficulty in predicting future service behavior, it is difficult to predict future traffic between each data center pair (i.e., the traffic matrix). To account for this traffic uncertainty, we’ve made design methodology changes that will eliminate our dependence on predicting the future traffic matrix.

**How to Become a Bad Developer**  
https://rafaelquintanilha.com/how-to-become-a-bad-developer  
If your goal, fellow reader, is to become a good developer instead, don’t worry. Remember that via negativa is way more powerful than via positiva. That means that knowing what not to do is safer and easier to figure out than exactly what to do. So pay attention to the following topics and decide which type of developer you want to be.

**1931: Kurt Gödel, founder of theoretical computer science, shows limits of math, logic, computing, and artificial intelligence**  
https://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/goedel-1931-founder-theoretical-computer-science-AI.html  
In 2021, we are celebrating the 90th anniversary of Kurt Gödel's groundbreaking 1931 paper which laid the foundations of theoretical computer science and the theory of artificial intelligence (AI). Gödel sent shock waves through the academic community when he identified the fundamental limits of theorem proving, computing, AI, logics, and mathematics itself. This had enormous impact on science and philosophy of the 20th century. Ten years to go until the Gödel centennial in 2031!

People who view the venerable Mac OS user interface as an older person whose traits must be experimented upon, plastic surgery after plastic surgery, until this person looks younger. Unfortunately the effect is more like this person ends up looking… weird.

https://www.uxpin.com/studio/blog/ui-component-library/  
A component library is a pretty handy thing to have, especially if you need to scale fast. And while some would argue the case for building their own as part of their enterprise design system, the time and resources needed to build from scratch often outweigh any long-term gain. Instead, when optimizing development across many platforms, it’s wise to consider using a component library.
