**Software infrastructure 2.0: a wishlist**  
https://erikbern.com/2021/04/19/software-infrastructure-2.0-a-wishlist.html  
In the last few months, I've thought a lot about where it's going in the next 5-10 years and an wishlist has taken shape in my head. It's very opinionated! As in, you may not agree with these. That's fine — these are fundamentally predictions I'm making, or at least a wishlist. I'm OK if I'm right about some but not all of these. Let's dive right in.

**Introducing .NET Multi-platform App UI (MAUI)**  
https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/introducing-net-multi-platform-app-ui/  
[.NET MAUI](https://github.com/dotnet/maui ) is an evolution of the increasingly popular Xamarin.Forms toolkit that turns 6 years old this month. For years companies such as UPS, Ernst & Young, and Delta have been leveraging the mobile expertise of Xamarin atop .NET to power their businesses; some since the very beginning. It has also been very successful in helping small businesses maximize their development investment sharing upwards of 95% of their code, and beating their competitors to market.

https://earthly.dev/blog/brown-green-language/

**美团Serverless平台Nest的探索与实践**  
https://tech.meituan.com/2021/04/21/nest-serverless.html  
Serverless一词于2012年被提出，2014年由于亚马逊的AWS Lambda无服务器计算服务的兴起，而被大家广泛认知。Serverless通常被直译成“无服务器”，无服务器计算是可以让用户在不考虑服务器的情况下构建并运行应用程序。使用无服务器计算，应用程序仍在服务器上运行，但所有服务器管理工作均由Serverless平台负责。如机器申请、代码发布、机器宕机、实例扩缩容、机房容灾等都由平台帮助自动完成，业务开发只需考虑业务逻辑的实现即可。

Our challenge as an engineering team was how to rethink our search infrastructure in a way that would enable our members to better connect with the opportunities, resources, and communities on LinkedIn, while also empowering our team internally by removing the roadblocks that sprung up as we grew to nearly 740 million members.

一个名词，一个叫作Metaverse的名词，正在全世界喧嚣，令众多企业、无数资本着迷。这个名词出自一本陈旧的科幻小说《雪崩》(Snow Crash)，它构建了一个新世界，就叫Metaverse。29年前出版的这本小说「预见了即将发生的事情」，一个脱胎于现实世界、又与现实世界平行、且始终在线的新世界在迭代中正慢慢显露出来。但到底应该怎么理解Metaverse？它离我们到底有多远？去往Metaverse有哪些路径？以及在这个进程会否出现下一代的平台型公司，下一代的微信、Facebook又会出现在哪里？本文作者陈军宏就此分享了他的观点和预判，他期望能引发更多讨论甚至争论，为看见未来、看清前路贡献一份力量。因为对于Metaverse，还没有谁能明确前路。本文提出了透视未来的七个观察，提出了由近及远的一系列预测，探讨了下一代互联网可能的特征，讨论了未来世界中人类将面临的机会与生存危机。另附：[2022：关于下一代网络的思考](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/367365574)。
