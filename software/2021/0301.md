**10 Years of Open-Source Visualization**  
https://observablehq.com/@mbostock/10-years-of-open-source-visualization  
Did I learn anything from D3.js? Let’s see… In honor of D3 1.0’s tin anniversary, I thought I’d reflect on lessons learned. This isn’t intended to be too comprehensive or serious — just a handful of observations as I look ahead to the next ten years. But I hope a nugget or two will interest you, too.

**The Future of Web Software Is HTML-over-WebSockets**  
https://alistapart.com/article/the-future-of-web-software-is-html-over-websockets/  
The future of web-based software architectures is already taking form, and this time it’s server-rendered (again). Papa’s got a brand new bag: HTML-over-WebSockets and broadcast everything all the time.

**Modules, monoliths, and microservices**  
https://tailscale.com/blog/modules-monoliths-and-microservices/  
Lately, I get people asking me when microservices are a good idea. In systems design explains the world, I talked about big-picture issues like second system effect, innovator’s dilemmas, and more. Can systems design answer the microservices question?

**Open source in the 5G stack**  
https://github.blog/2021-02-23-open-source-in-the-5g-stack/  
Time and again, the developer community has created open source solutions to address pressing needs. Many of these solutions, including for government challenges and in the 5G stack, have been developed on GitHub. We stand committed to helping policymakers around the world understand how collaborative development and open source can address legitimate concerns around participation, security, sovereignty, and interoperability—in 5G and beyond.

**JavaScript performance beyond bundle size**  
https://nolanlawson.com/2021/02/23/javascript-performance-beyond-bundle-size/  
A JavaScript dependency can affect all of these metrics. But they’re less discussed than bundle size, and I suspect it’s because they’re less straightforward to measure. In this post, I want to talk about how I approach bundle size, and how I approach the other metrics too.

**Dependency Injection in React**  
https://8thlight.com/blog/rani-zilpelwar/2021/02/18/dependency-injection-react.html  
This blog details some techniques for using dependency injection in React.

**Timed Finite State Machines with React and XState**  
https://altrim.io/posts/timed-finite-state-machines-with-react-and-xstate  
In particular I remember I enjoyed playing around with Timed Automatons. A timed automaton is a finite-state machine extended with clock variables. To demonstrate what a timed automaton is I will use XState with React.

**Recreating Real-World Terrain With React, Three.js & WebGL Shaders**  
https://techblog.geekyants.com/recreating-real-world-terrain-with-react-threejs-and-webgl-shaders-1  
This article is going to help you recreate something similar, albeit in much lower detail and on a much, much smaller scale. However, I think you'll find it's exciting nonetheless.

**Before You memo()**  
https://overreacted.io/before-you-memo/  
In this post, I want to share two different techniques. They’re surprisingly basic, which is why people rarely realize they improve rendering performance. These techniques are complementary to what you already know! They don’t replace memo or useMemo, but they’re often good to try first.

**一款可以让大型iOS工程编译速度提升50%的工具**  
https://tech.meituan.com/2021/02/25/cocoapods-hmap-prebuilt.html  
cocoapods-hmap-prebuilt 是美团平台迭代组自研的一款 cocoapods 插件，以 Header Map 技术 为基础，进一步提升代码的编译速度，完善头文件的搜索机制。虽然以二进制组件的方式构建 App 是 HPX （美团移动端统一持续集成/交付平台）的主流解决方案，但在某些场景下（Profile、Address/Thread/UB/Coverage Sanitizer、App 级别静态检查、ObjC 方法调用兼容性检查等等），我们的构建工作还是需要以全源码编译的方式进行；而且在实际开发过程中，大多是以源码的方式进行开发，所以我们将实验对象设置为基于全源码编译的流程。另附：[How Uber Deals with Large iOS App Size](https://eng.uber.com/how-uber-deals-with-large-ios-app-size/).

**Building a WebAssembly Runtime for BBC iPlayer and enhanced audience experiences**  
https://medium.com/bbc-design-engineering/building-a-webassembly-runtime-for-bbc-iplayer-and-enhanced-audience-experiences-7087455808ef  
The Render Engine Broadcasting (REB) project has therefore been investigating new technologies that will allow the BBC to deliver these OBM experiences at scale to all BBC audiences, no matter what device they use. Our ultimate goal is to be able to deliver real time and fully rendered experiences on any device or platform, and write the software to do it only once. We have been investigating the use of WebAssembly as a cross-platform technology for this.

**What I wish I had known about single page applications**  
https://stackoverflow.blog/2021/02/24/what-i-wish-i-had-known-about-single-page-applications/  
Single page apps are all the rage today, but they don't always operate the same as traditional web pages.

**Visualizing Data Timeliness at Airbnb**  
https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/visualizing-data-timeliness-at-airbnb-ee638fdf4710  
In this project, we have applied data visualization and UI/UX design — the interdisciplinary craft we refer to as “Data Experience” — to important data timeliness problems that require deep understanding of complex temporal and hierarchical information. This has enabled us to make data timeliness insights accessible, even in the complex data ecosystem of a large-scale company. It requires time and iteration to develop sophisticated visual analytics tools but the resulting product can provide great value to your organization.

**FOQS: Scaling a distributed priority queue**  
https://engineering.fb.com/2021/02/22/production-engineering/foqs-scaling-a-distributed-priority-queue/  
Facebook Ordered Queueing Service (FOQS) fills that role. It’s a fully managed, horizontally scalable, multitenant, persistent distributed priority queue built on top of sharded MySQL that enables developers at Facebook to decouple and scale microservices and distributed systems. We’re openly sharing the design of FOQS, with the hope that the broader engineering community can build upon the ideas and designs presented here.

**Go is not an easy language**  
https://www.arp242.net/go-easy.html  
Go is not an easy programming language. It is simple in many ways: the syntax is simple, most of the semantics are simple. But a language is more than just syntax; it’s about doing useful stuff. And doing useful stuff is not always easy in Go. Releated: [A Proposal to Add Fuzzing to the Go Standard Library ](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/44551), [You'll be Back (to Go) - Go generics is coming in Go 1.18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rzo8u03vC7Y).

**Nuklear**  
https://github.com/Immediate-Mode-UI/Nuklear  
This is a minimal-state, immediate-mode graphical user interface toolkit written in ANSI C and licensed under public domain. It was designed as a simple embeddable user interface for application and does not have any dependencies, a default render backend or OS window/input handling but instead provides a highly modular, library-based approach, with simple input state for input and draw commands describing primitive shapes as output. So instead of providing a layered library that tries to abstract over a number of platform and render backends, it focuses only on the actual UI.

**中国to B故事：为什么渐次抛弃Salesforce？**  
https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/352849913  
「甲子光年」采访了十余家to B创业公司和三位to B赛道投资人，总结出了以下四个观点：  
1. Salesforce在中国市场失灵的原因在于中国中小企业生命周期短暂、销售成本过高，吞掉了利润、标准化的理想最终只能走向定制化。  
2. 从SMB到KA的转型根本解决了工具产品与使用企业之间的粘性问题。  
3.SMB和KA并没有孰是孰非，关键在于企业自身的定位和如何保持与使用者之间的粘性。  
4.以工具为钩子、从其他相关产品中盈利，是更普遍的做法，也更能增强工具与使用者之间的粘性。
