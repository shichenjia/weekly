**Why I'm losing faith in UX**  
https://creativegood.com/blog/21/losing-faith-in-ux.html  
https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25950351  
Digital design increasingly exploits users. The unholy rebirth of UX has had a staggering cost. It's well beyond the stupid hassle of Prime cancellations, and even beyond the Big Tech criminality I've written about. In the end, turning UX into an actively harmful discipline has drained talent and expertise away from projects that could, and should, have had more help.

**Organizational Effectiveness**  
https://martinfowler.com/articles/developer-effectiveness.html#OrganizationalEffectiveness  
Highly effective organizations have designed their engineering organization to optimize for effectiveness and feedback loops. Leadership over time creates a culture that leads to empowering developers to make incremental improvements to these feedback loops. It starts with a recognition by leadership that technology — and removing friction from development teams — is vital to the business. This is manifested in a number of ways.

**The State of Virtual Reality Hardware**  
https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2021/2/250071-the-state-of-virtual-reality-hardware/fulltext  
For decades, virtual reality (VR) has seemed like a futuristic dream that is just around the corner, but never reaches its full potential. This time, however, might really be different. Recent advances in the power of VR hardware, notably the headsets and processors used to produce realistic VR experiences, suggest that VR is finally powerful enough and cheap enough to go mainstream.

**Software development topics I've changed my mind on after 6 years in the industry**  
https://chriskiehl.com/article/thoughts-after-6-years  
Typed languages are better when you're working on a team of people with various experience levels. Bad code can be written in any paradigm. In general, RDBMS > NoSql. Functional programming is another tool, not a panacea...

**Improving how we deploy GitHub**  
https://github.blog/2021-01-25-improving-how-we-deploy-github/  
Over the last year GitHub has doubled the number of developers contributing to the main GitHub.com application. While this seems like a solely positive thing on the surface, the 2x increase in folks contributing to the core software exposed some problems in terms of tooling. Tooling that worked for us a year ago no longer functioned in the same capacity. While GitHub itself has been a fantastic vehicle to drive change for GitHub, the deployment tooling and coordination has not enjoyed the same levels of success. One of those areas was our deployments. Releated: [Making GitHub’s new homepage fast and performant](https://github.blog/2021-01-29-making-githubs-new-homepage-fast-and-performant/).

**Tao of React - Software Design, Architecture & Best Practices**  
https://alexkondov.com/tao-of-react/  
The purpose of a software’s architecture and design is to keep it productive and flexible. Developers need to work on it effectively and modify it without rewriting its core. This article is a collection of principles and rules that have proven to be effective for me and the teams I’ve worked with. I outline good practices about components, application structure, testing, styling, state management and data fetching. Some of the examples are oversimplified so we can focus on the principle not on the implementation. Releated: [I Almost Got Fired for Choosing React in Our Enterprise App](https://medium.com/better-programming/i-almost-got-fired-for-choosing-react-in-our-enterprise-app-846ea840841c).

**Responsible Web Applications**  
https://responsibleweb.app/  
Luckily, with modern HTML and CSS, we can create responsive and accessible web apps with relative ease. In my years of doing software development, I have learned some HTML and CSS tips and tricks, and I want to present these in this post. This list is not exhaustive, but these are tried and true patterns that I frequently use in different projects.

**Can you make a basic web app without googling?**  
https://web.eecs.utk.edu/~azh/blog/webappwithoutgoogling.html  
I wanted to test my mastery of Node.js and my reliance on Google and Stack Overflow, so I set out on an adventure to make a todo list web app without touching any external resource for help. I just couldn't do it. To be fair, I'm not a web developer so I'm not entirely shocked by this. I only have the itch (and time) to throw together a small web app about once every 6 months. But this got me thinking. How many people out there, especially professional web developers, can do this? It isn't to say that you should be able to. But it is an interesting thing to study.

**Website Fingerprinting on Early QUIC Traffic**  
https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.11871  
Whether QUIC protocol can effectively resisting to such attacks is worth investigating. In this work, we demonstrated the extreme vulnerability of QUIC under WFP attacks by comparing attack results under well-designed conditions. We also study the transferability of features, which enable the adversary to use proven effective features on a special protocol attacking a new protocol. This study shows that QUIC is more vulnerable to WFP attacks than HTTPS in the early traffic scenario but is similar in the normal scenario. 

**undefined vs. null revisited**  
https://2ality.com/2021/01/undefined-null-revisited.html  
Many programming languages have one “non-value” called null. It indicates that a variable does not currently point to an object – for example, when it hasn’t been initialized yet. In contrast, JavaScript has two such non-values: undefined and null. In this blog post, we examine how they differ and how to best use or avoid them.

**10 bad TypeScript habits to break this year**  
https://startup-cto.net/10-bad-typescript-habits-to-break-this-year/

Here's a list of 10 habits that we all should break.

**How machine learning powers Facebook’s News Feed ranking algorithm**  
https://engineering.fb.com/2021/01/26/ml-applications/news-feed-ranking/  
Designing a personalized ranking system for more than 2 billion people (all with different interests) and a plethora of content to select from presents significant, complex challenges. This is something we tackle every day with News Feed ranking. Without machine learning (ML), people’s News Feeds could be flooded with content they don’t find as relevant or interesting, including overly promotional content or content from acquaintances who post frequently, which can bury the content from the people they’re closest to. Ranking exists to help solve these problems, but how can you build a system that presents so many different types of content in a way that’s personally relevant to billions of people around the world? We use ML to predict which content will matter most to each person to support a more engaging and positive experience.
