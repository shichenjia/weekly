**20 Things I’ve Learned in my 20 Years as a Software Engineer**  
https://www.simplethread.com/20-things-ive-learned-in-my-20-years-as-a-software-engineer/  
You’re about to read a blog post with a lot of advice. Learning from those who came before us is instrumental to success, but we often forget an important caveat. Almost all advice is contextual, yet it is rarely delivered with any context.

**The Case for ‘Developer Experience’**  
https://future.a16z.com/the-case-for-developer-experience/  
There’s been a lot of buzz around APIs, “no code,” and “low code”: Developers can add new features more easily than ever before! While it’s true that this new wave of tools has helped developers build bigger systems, and build them faster, it turns out that developers are now spending their time worrying about an unintended consequence: How exactly are they supposed to manage and coordinate these fast-moving, heterogeneous systems — and free themselves to build?

**Why Web3 Matters**  
https://future.a16z.com/why-web3-matters/  
Web3 is the internet owned by the builders and users, orchestrated with tokens. Why does web3 matter? First, let’s look at the problems with centralized platforms. Centralized platforms follow a predictable life cycle. At first, they do everything they can to recruit users and third-party complements like creators, developers, and businesses.

**RenderingNG: an architecture that makes and keeps Chrome fast for the long term**  
https://blog.chromium.org/2021/10/renderingng.html  
https://developer.chrome.com/en/blog/layoutng/  
RenderingNG is a long-term project to systematically improve Chrome performance as experienced by our users over time, while also anticipating future needs. This enables the web to stay fast even as the web becomes ever richer and more featureful.

**AI Is No Match for the Quirks of Human Intelligence**  
https://thereader.mitpress.mit.edu/ai-insight-problems-quirks-human-intelligence/  
We may sometimes behave like computers, but more often, we are creative, irrational, and not always too bright.

**Understanding how Facebook disappeared from the internet**  
https://blog.cloudflare.com/october-2021-facebook-outage/  
https://engineering.fb.com/2021/10/05/networking-traffic/outage-details/

https://www.npr.org/2021/10/04/1042921981/facebook-whistleblower-renewing-scrutiny-of-social-media-giant  
This wasn't a DNS issue itself, but failing DNS was the first symptom we'd seen of a larger Facebook outage. How's that even possible?

**My Challenge to the Web Performance Community**  
https://philipwalton.com/articles/my-challenge-to-the-web-performance-community/  
In my experience working on the Web Vitals initiative at Google, the number one issue we hear from the community—by far—is confusion around why the numbers that they see in one tool don’t match the numbers they see in another tool, and in most of these cases the reason is because one tool reports lab data and the other reports field data. Of course, performance is a complex topic, and it’s perfectly understandable that some confusion exists. But when I really step back and think about why there’s so much confusion, I just keep coming back to what I touched on above: the way people talk about performance publicly and on social media.

**Safe DOM manipulation with the Sanitizer API**  
https://web.dev/sanitizer/  
The new Sanitizer API aims to build a robust processor for arbitrary strings to be safely inserted into a page.

**GraphQL 为何没有火起来?**  
https://www.zhihu.com/question/38596306/answer/2152153081  
我个人的观点是，截止目前为止（2021），graphql 并不是一个后端值得尝试的东西，接口怎么定义是一个次要问题，后端关注的重点仍然是业务功能的实现以及更加传统的东西（安全，稳定，可靠，高并发，。。。），比如，作为一个前电商后端，双11、618的高 qps 才是我需要应对的问题。graphql 更多的需要前端去主动推动，并且需要清晰的结果阐明带来的整体性收益来说服后端，比如 github api 改成 graphql 带来的好处对于前端、后端各有哪些？后端er把时间放在数据库优化，缓存，中间件，微服务，service mesh上不香吗？最后，后端不是 CURD。

**How I built a modern website in 2021**  
https://kentcdodds.com/blog/how-i-built-a-modern-website-in-2021  
This blog post isn't about these and other features of the new site, but how I built it. There's too much to dive deep in a single blog post. I just want to give you an overview of the technologies and libraries I used to make this experience for you.

**React Philosophies: Simple, Practical, Easy-to-Follow Guidelines**  
https://github.com/mithi/react-philosophies

**A Guide To CSS Debugging**  
https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/10/guide-debugging-css/  
Debugging in CSS means figuring out what might be the problem when you have unexpected layout results. We’ll look at a few categories bugs often fit into, see how we can evaluate the situation, and explore techniques that help prevent these bugs.

**How I Make CSS Art**  
https://yosracodes.hashnode.dev/how-i-make-css-art  
On the third of June 2021, I created my very first CSS art. I had so much fun building this, and I continued building more and experiencing different methods to create them. My CSS art became better the more I practiced, and I got to know CSS better because of it. In fact, CodePen picked two (out of four) of my CSS arts to feature before. I decided to write this blog post to illustrate my thought process from the very beginning up until publishing the art on codepen. Hopefully, this will attract more people into creating CSS art and have fun with it,

**How to Store and Maintain NFT Metadata**  
https://blog.ipfs.io/how-to-store-and-maintain-nft-metadata/  
Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are among the most exciting recent developments in the cryptoverse. For those unaware of these gems, NFTs are like digital collectibles, each unique in its own way and linked to a particular user. Ownership aside, what also makes an NFT valuable is its metadata. If you're someone who spends a lot of time on the internet, you would probably recognize the term as data that exists about a particular digital signature or website. NFT metadata is similar but with some significant differences.

**Designing for Productivity in a Large-Scale iOS Application**

**Safe Updates of Client Applications at Netflix**  
https://netflixtechblog.com/safe-updates-of-client-applications-at-netflix-1d01c71a930c  
Our team was formed to mine health signals from the field to quickly evaluate new versions of the client applications. As we invested in systems to enable this vision, it led to increased development velocity, which arguably led to better development practices and quality of the applications. The goal of this blog post is to highlight the investment areas for this vision and the challenges we are facing today.

**Best practices for authentication and authorization for REST APIs**  
https://stackoverflow.blog/2021/10/06/best-practices-for-authentication-and-authorization-for-rest-apis/  
If you have a REST API accessible on the internet, you're going to need to secure it. Here's the best practices on how to do that.

**Who is empowered by your API design?**  
https://thoughtbot.com/blog/who-is-empowered-by-your-design  
Don brings up a fascinating question when it comes to language and API design: what kind of user do you most want to empower?

**SOA vs microservices: going beyond the monolith**  
https://circleci.com/blog/soa-vs-microservices/  
Since SOA is an admittedly older style, it may not be appropriate for modern cloud-native applications. But it still offers a number of benefits that make it a great choice in many different scenarios. By understanding which aspects of SOA are still relevant and which parts have been discarded in favor of microservices, you will be well equipped to choose between the two for your next service-based application. Let’s start by getting a feel for what SOA really is.

**How the Wikimedia Foundation deploys code**

**Herding elephants: Lessons learned from sharding Postgres at Notion**  
https://www.notion.so/blog/sharding-postgres-at-notion  
Earlier this year, we took Notion down for five minutes of scheduled maintenance. While our announcement gestured at “increased stability and performance,” behind the scenes was the culmination of months of focused, urgent teamwork: sharding Notion’s PostgreSQL monolith into a horizontally-partitioned database fleet.

**Is this the simplest (and most surprising) sorting algorithm ever?**  
https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.01111  
We present an extremely simple sorting algorithm. It may look like it is obviously wrong, but we prove that it is in fact correct. We compare it with other simple sorting algorithms, and analyse some of its curious properties.

**Open source software and managing technical debt**  
https://www.tiny.cloud/blog/open-source-manage-technical-debt/  
All projects, both private products and open source, have some kind of technical debt. If you don’t make a plan to manage that debt, small bugs build up overtime and can cause a codebase to run slowly, and test even more slowly. There are a range of other consequences that can build up when technical debt is left unmanaged.

**How to Build a Low-tech Solar Panel?**  
https://www.lowtechmagazine.com/2021/10/how-to-build-a-low-tech-solar-panel.html  
George Cove, a forgotten solar power pioneer, may have built a highly efficient photovoltaic panel 40 years before Bell Labs engineers invented silicon cells. If proven to work, his design could lead to less complex and more sustainable solar panels.

**A Product Story: Three Lessons We Learned from Developing the Mobile App**  
https://engineering.atspotify.com/2021/10/05/a-product-story-three-lessons-we-learned-from-developing-the-mobile-app/  
Remember what life was like before smartphones? Remember manually having to sync your computer’s playlists with your iPod every time you added a few songs? One of Spotify’s core products, our mobile app, was designed specifically to leave all of that busywork in the past, changing how we travel with our music forever.

**Are awesome lists really awesome?**  
https://shekhargulati.com/2021/10/08/are-awesome-lists-really-awesome/  
When I first learnt about these lists 4-5 years back I also started collecting(hoarding :)) them. Over time I realized most of these lists are not useful. They are just a laundry list of web links. They don’t tell you what to do with that stuff, how to navigate the landscape for that specific technology/topic, and how to answer real questions. To make it more clear, let’s take awesome-microservices[2] as an example. It has more than 10000 stars. Below is the table of content of this awesome list.

**What Is a Good User Experience?**  
https://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2021/10/what-is-a-good-user-experience.php  
To get us all on the same page about capital G, good design, I’m kicking off my column with a discussion about design ethics. This topic feels particularly relevant given the recent news from Menlo Park, California. As I write this, The Wall Street Journal has released The Facebook Files, investigative research that concludes what many of us have suspected for years: Facebook has some special rules for elite users. Instagram is toxic for teenage girls. Facebook is an angry place and makes the world an angrier place.
