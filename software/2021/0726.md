**你可能并不需要微前端**  
https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/391248835
基于此，微前端很多时候是「悲观主义工程师」在工程上的妥协，是一种防御性，有时候甚至是「掩耳盗铃」式的架构策略。当然在理想状态下，对于一个有追求的工程师而言，所有的技术问题都应该是被正面修复、正确治理的，而不是起手就来一个 workaround。但同时所有的软件工程原则也都会告诉我们，不遗余力、不计成本的去优化、解决一个技术问题是不可取的，尤其是在这个问题的投入产出比不高的情况下。微前端倡导的不是消极的、投降主义的去回避系统中的历史遗留问题，而是告诉我们，很多时候我们可以通过分而治之的手段，让「上帝的归上帝，凯撒的归凯撒」。大部分时候，一个「流行」的东西，你都无法阻止不需要它的人去使用它。另附：[对巨石应用说不：转转商业微前端qiankun历史项目迁移升级实践](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/jFjbPpWoWH2b6QfWL1W7yw)。

**3 Problems Big Software Teams Face and How To Mitigate Them**  
https://spin.atomicobject.com/2021/07/25/problems-big-software-teams/  
At Atomic Object, we prefer to work in small, self-managing teams (2-10 people). However, as consultants, we recognize that some circumstances necessitate larger teams. In those situations, it’s important to understand the trade-offs and consequences and work to mitigate them. Below are three common issues big software teams face and how you can work to mitigate them.

**The Future Of The Web**  
https://www.hazem.cool/blog/the-future-of-the-web   
The web will be the final OS, all connected, forever evolving. There will come a time when somebody points to their computer device and they'll not point to their laptop, or their phone, or their glasses, or even their microwave, they'll point to the sky and say "it's somewhere...everywhere

**Node-RED Version 2.0 released**  
https://nodered.org/blog/2021/07/20/version-2-0-released  
The main focus of this release has been dropping support for old versions of Node.js that are themselves no longer supported. This in turn has allowed us to make some major dependency updates internally. This has required time and effort to do properly. As such, there are not a lot of big new features in this release - but there are certainly plenty of useful things to play with.

**Temporal - the iPhone of System Design**  
https://www.swyx.io/why-temporal/  
I'm excited to finally share why I've joined Temporal.io as Head of Developer Experience. It's taken me months to precisely pin down why I have been obsessed with Workflows in general and Temporal in particular. It boils down to 3 core opinions: Orchestration, Event Sourcing, and Workflows-as-Code.

**Why self hosting is important**  
https://dataswamp.org/~solene/2021-07-23-why-selfhosting-is-important.html  
I'm self hosting since I first understood running a web server was the only thing I required to have my own PHP forum 15 years ago. I mostly keep this blog alive to show and share my experiments, most of the time happening when playing with my self hosting servers. I have a strong opinion on the subject, hosting your own services is a fantastic way to learn new skills or perfect them, but it's also important for freedom. In France we even have associative ISP and even if they are small, their existence force the big ISP companies to be transparent on their processes and interoperatibility. If you disagree with me, this is fine. Releated: [Hashnode: A Blogging Platform for Developers](https://css-tricks.com/hashnode-a-blogging-platform-for-developers/).

**聊聊中后台前端应用：上下文的那些事儿**  
https://ourai.ws/posts/things-about-contexts-in-frontend-projects/  
在《聊聊中后台前端应用：模块相关的一些事》和《聊聊中后台前端应用：业务中的组件体系》这两篇文章中都对「上下文」有所描述，简单来说，它对于程序的作用就相当于帮助人去理解事物并做出相应反应的「语境」，毕竟它们的英文都是「context」。在实际应用时，「上下文」很可能是一个带有很多属性及对其进行读、写操作的方法的对象。那些已经被暴露出来或没有被暴露出来的变量，就是上文所说的「状态」，而暴露出来的方法或函数就是对「状态」进行管理用的——它们共同构成了「上下文」。

**Organize your CSS declarations alphabetically**  
https://ericwbailey.design/writing/organize-your-css-declarations-alphabetically/

**Migrating Facebook to MySQL 8.0**  
https://engineering.fb.com/2021/07/22/data-infrastructure/mysql/  
Despite all the hurdles in our migration path, we have already seen the benefits of running 8.0. Some applications have opted for early conversion to 8.0 to utilize features like Document Store and improved datetime support. We have been considering how to support storage engine features like Instant DDL on MyRocks. Overall, the new version greatly expands on what we can do with MySQL @ Facebook.

**Towards Inserting One Billion Rows in SQLite Under A Minute**  
https://avi.im/blag/2021/fast-sqlite-inserts/  
Recently, I ran into a situation where I needed a test database with lots of rows and needed it fast. So I did what any programmer would do: wrote a Python script to generate the DB. Unfortunately, it was slow. Really slow. So I did what any programmer would do: went down the rabbit hole of learning more about SQLite, Python, and eventually Rust… in my quest to get a 1B row database under a minute. This blog post is a summary of this fun and educational exercise

**Putting the power of AlphaFold into the world’s hands**  
https://deepmind.com/blog/article/putting-the-power-of-alphafold-into-the-worlds-hands  
When we announced AlphaFold 2 last December, it was hailed as a solution to the 50-year old protein folding problem. Last week, we published the scientific paper and source code explaining how we created this highly innovative system, and today we’re sharing high-quality predictions for the shape of every single protein in the human body, as well as for the proteins of 20 additional organisms that scientists rely on for their research.

**Summer Blog Backlog: Distributed Systems**  
http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2021/07/blog-backlog-2.html  
Concretely, when you use cloud platforms like AWS or Heroku, you're using command line tools in the shell to build, test, configure, and deploy applications. I hope Oil can be the foundation for better systems, but there's still a big gap to bridge. This post is focused on criticism of the status quo, since we have to identify problems in order to solve them.

**I `****i`ng hate Science**  
https://buttondown.email/hillelwayne/archive/i-ing-hate-science/  
I’m a big advocate of Empirical Software Engineering. I wrote a talk on it. I wrote a 6000-word post covering one controversy. I spend a lot of time reading papers and talking to software researchers. ESE matters a lot to me.

**The Nine States of Design**  
https://medium.com/swlh/the-nine-states-of-design-5bfe9b3d6d85  
Modern UI teams are designing components first; Interfaces are merely the thoughtful composition of components. This leaves an often glaring hole for users on “the unhappy path” — The places where users may, intentionally or not, stray from your idealized flow. As we learn to craft systems rather than pages, we must invest effort into shaping these often missed states of design and create with a component lifecycle that can support everyone. Here’s the lifecycle as I see it.

**The Genius of Apple's Name**  
https://www.swyx.io/apples-name/  
An excerpt from Becoming Steve Jobs that made me stop in my tracks. Apple is not a word for geeks, unlike Asus, Compaq, Control Data, Data General, DEC, IBM, Sperry Rand, Texas Instruments, or Wipro, to mention some less felicitously named computer companies. It hints at a company that would bring, as it eventually did, humanism and creativity to the science and engineering of computers. As Clow suggests, settling on Apple was a great, intuitive decision. Steve was innately comfortable trusting his gut; it’s a characteristic of the best entrepreneurs, a necessity for anyone who wants to make a living developing things no one has ever quite imagined before.

Claiming that “right-wing voices are being censored,” Republican-led legislatures in Florida and Texas have introduced legislation to “end Big Tech censorship.” They say that the dominant tech platforms block legitimate speech without ever articulating their moderation policies, that they are slow to admit their mistakes, and that there is no meaningful due process for people who think the platforms got it wrong.

https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/NqKsnbitBxk_m0SphUTOmw  
时代发展到现在。个人自我意识追求更加明确，新生代员工不再致力于成为“组织人”，他们会成为自己想成为的人。组织如果不做出改变，依然要求人为组织工作、为实现组织目标工作，那么新生代员工、有创造力的个体很难和组织组合在一起。所以，今天的组织管理必须从实现组织目标到兼顾人的意义。
