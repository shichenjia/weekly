**How to Work Hard**  
http://paulgraham.com/hwh.html  
Working hard is not just a dial you turn up to 11. It's a complicated, dynamic system that has to be tuned just right at each point. You have to understand the shape of real work, see clearly what kind you're best suited for, aim as close to the true core of it as you can, accurately judge at each moment both what you're capable of and how you're doing, and put in as many hours each day as you can without harming the quality of the result. This network is too complicated to trick. But if you're consistently honest and clear-sighted, it will automatically assume an optimal shape, and you'll be productive in a way few people are.

**Software Engineering Principles**  
https://principles.dev/

**RenderingNG - Ready for the next generation of web content**  
https://developer.chrome.com/blog/renderingng/  
In 2021, we will largely complete the process of designing, building and shipping this architecture. Let's call it RenderingNG, since it is truly a next-generation rendering architecture that greatly outperforms what came before. RenderingNG has been in progress for at least eight years, and represents the collective work of many dedicated Chromium developers. It unlocks a huge amount of potential for the next generation of fast, fluid, reliable, responsive and interactive web content. It's also a baseline that I believe defines a new minimum standard for all web rendering engines that developers can rely on.

**Estimating Software Projects**  
https://jacobian.org/series/estimation/  
One major “secret” to advancing in a technical career is learning how to give accurate estimates. It certainly has been for me: I don’t shy away from giving timelines, and I’ve learned how to be right often enough that folks trust my estimates.

**Unleash Your Creativity with Stickers on Discord**  
https://blog.discord.com/unleash-your-creativity-with-stickers-on-discord-99363194871  
While testing, we received a ton of valuable feedback. You loved the wide range of stickers that we created, and what we heard more than anything else was that you wanted ways to personalize them and make them feel like your own. That’s why it’s so exciting to not only reintroduce Stickers to Discord but to give you ways to introduce your own.

**CSS Frameworks in Vogue, But Don’t Forget Style Fundamentals**  
https://thenewstack.io/css-frameworks-in-vogue-but-dont-forget-style-fundamentals/  
The reality, though, is that designers and developers will mix and match the use of frameworks with emerging web standards like CSS Grid. Which is the sensible approach; the danger is when you become overly-reliant on frameworks and don’t learn the fundamentals below the abstractions.

**Zero-Width Space**  
https://css-tricks.com/zero-width-space/  
The name zero-width space is antithetical, but it’s not without uses. In text, maybe you’d use it around slashes because you want to be sure the words are treated individually but not have any physical space around the slash.

**Migrating from Capybara to Puppeteer**  
https://eng.wealthfront.com/2021/06/25/migrating-from-capybara-to-puppeteer/  
A little over 9 months ago, Wealthfront converted 100% of our end-to-end tests from Selenium (via Capybara) to Puppeteer. The process involved converting hundreds of tests that provide coverage for just about all of Wealthfront’s product offerings on the website. This blog post will cover why we migrated away from Selenium, the process we used to convert the tests, and the result of the completed conversion.

**The Untold Story of SQLite**  
https://corecursive.com/066-sqlite-with-richard-hipp/  
On today’s show, I’m talking to Richard Hipp about surviving becoming core infrastructure for the world. SQLite is everywhere. It’s in your web browser, it’s in your phone, it’s probably in your car, and it’s definitely in commercial planes. It’s where your iMessages and WhatsApp messages are stored, and if you do a find on your computer for *.db, you’ll be amazed at how many SQLite databases you find.

**Feature of the month - Table features in CKEditor 5**  
https://ckeditor.com/blog/feature-of-the-month-tables-in-ckeditor-5/  
Tables are all around us, being so popular and frequently seen that we do not pay attention to them anymore, and only concentrate on the information they hold. There are tables of content, which, in fact, are more of a list thing than a table, but we do have multiplication tables and also periodic tables of elements to consider. A highway signpost is a table and a software database — like the one that keeps this blog post data — is a table. The tables are everywhere and the reason for that is that they are simply the best at presenting certain types of information.

**SolidJS Official Release: The long road to 1.0**  
https://dev.to/ryansolid/solidjs-official-release-the-long-road-to-1-0-4ldd  
It's been a long road to get here. It's been so long I can't even remember when I started. I logged on to an old private Bitbucket Repo and found "initial commit" on a repo aptly named "framework" from August 21st 2016. But I'm pretty sure that was my second prototype of a Reactive JavaScript Framework that would eventually become SolidJS

**JS Is Weird**  
https://jsisweird.com/  
JavaScript is a great programming language, but thanks to the fact that its initial release was built in only ten days back in 1995, coupled with the fact that JS is backward-compatible, it's also a bit weird. It doesn't always behave the way you might think. In this quiz, you'll be shown 25 quirky expressions and will have to guess the output. Even if you're a JS developer, most of this syntax is probably, and hopefully, not something you use in your daily life. Reletaed: [JavaScript: The First 20 Years](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3386327).

**Open Source Insights**  
https://deps.dev/  
Open Source Insights is an experimental service developed and hosted by Google to help developers better understand the structure, construction, and security of open source software packages. The service examines each package, constructs a full, detailed graph of its dependencies and their properties, and makes the results available to anyone who could benefit from them. The goal is to provide developers with a picture of how their software is put together, how that changes as dependencies change, and what the consequences might be.

n the software industry, there is a term for intentional designs which coerce the user into doing something, be it consciously or subconsciously - a ‘dark pattern’. These patterns are employed by social media networks, e-commerce, video games, and many more places. I’m coining a new term called the ‘Fuck You’ pattern currently employed by Instagram.

**Try Storybook Integration: Say Goodbye to Design-Dev Inconsistencies**  
https://www.uxpin.com/studio/blog/try-storybook-integration-design-with-code/  
Just a few weeks ago, we wrote about our game-changing Storybook integration, which helps designers and developers break the silos and improve the UI consistency by using code components when building prototypes. Based on our Merge technology, the integration lets you harvest the power of code, use it to build advanced prototypes faster and massively reduces the complexity of the handoff process. The bottom line is, both designers and devs get to build products with the same components. Now, we’ve decided to go one step further – today, we’re enabling Storybook integration on trial.

**Enterprise UX: the Value of Usability for Enterprise Software**  
https://uxmag.com/articles/enterprise-ux-the-value-of-usability-for-enterprise-software  
Although UX design had a lot of buzz in the last few years and businesses speeded up to improve the usability of their products, it is still a common case when enterprise software suffers from a lack of attention to end-user satisfaction. As a consequence, this might lead to poor employee experience and frustration, which in turns decreases the overall productivity. By enhancing the focus on enterprise UX, businesses can improve employees’ efficiency and ease collaboration.

**Asynchronous Design Critique: Getting Feedback**  
https://alistapart.com/article/asynchronous-design-critique-giving-feedback-part2/  
“Any comment?” is probably one of the worst ways to ask for feedback. It’s vague and open ended, and it doesn’t provide any indication of what we’re looking for. Getting good feedback starts earlier than we might expect: it starts with the request.
