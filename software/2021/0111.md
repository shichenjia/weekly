**Maximizing Developer Effectiveness**  
https://martinfowler.com/articles/developer-effectiveness.html  
Technology is constantly becoming smarter and more powerful. I often observe that as these technologies are introduced an organization’s productivity instead of improving has reduced. This is because the technology has increased complexities and cognitive overhead to the developer, reducing their effectiveness. In this article, the first of a series, I introduce a framework for maximizing developer effectiveness. Through research I have identified key developer feedback loops, including micro-feedback loops that developers do 200 times a day. These should be optimized so they are quick, simple and impactful for developers. I will examine how some organizations have used these feedback loops to improve overall effectiveness and productivity.

**Front-end predictions for 2021**  
https://www.browserlondon.com/blog/2021/01/04/front-end-predictions-2021/  
Back in our 2019 forecast, we noted that the role of the front-end developer was increasingly shifting towards ‘full-stack’, and this has borne out to be true. Even the evolution of our frameworks and tools suggests this, with an increased focus on data-fetching, concurrency, security and scalability. There is a natural meeting point occurring, where engineers are faced with increasingly ‘back-end’ problems while tooling and services are becoming sophisticated enough to lower the barrier to entry. It’s a perfect storm, and I expect to see it continue throughout 2021.

**Wasmer 1.0 is now generally available**  
https://medium.com/wasmer/wasmer-1-0-3f86ca18c043  
We believe that WebAssembly will be a crucial component for the future of software execution and containerization (not only inside the browser but also outside). By leveraging Wasm for software containerization, we create universal binaries that work anywhere without modification, including operating systems like Linux, macOS, Windows, and also web browsers. Wasm automatically sandboxes applications by default for secure execution, shielding the host environment from malicious code, bugs and vulnerabilities in the software it runs.

**Nocalhost**  
https://github.com/nocalhost/nocalhost  
https://www.zhihu.com/question/436014358  
Nocalhost is cloud native development environment. Check https://nocalhost.dev for more details. The term "Nocalhost" originates from No localhost. Its vision is that in the cloud era, developers use remote cloud native development environments to complete development instead of configuring developing, debugging and testing environments on local computers.

**Inside the React Core team**  
https://react.christmas/2020/24  
Even if you haven’t accomplished the things you expected to at the start of this year, trust that setbacks and disruption are the norm rather than the exception, good times or bad, even on React. The React Core team places importance on doing the right thing in the right way. And sometimes, that means being patient with each other when pushing through a dip, be it emotional or technical. It means asking for assistance and second opinions rather than trying to do everything alone. It means having faith that just because you aren’t shipping, doing, releasing doesn’t mean you aren’t providing value. More: [React Christmas](https://react.christmas/2020).

**2020 review: How serverless solutions helped customers thrive in uncertainty**  
https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/serverless/google-cloud-serverless-and-app-dev-services-in-2020  
What a year it has been. 2020 challenged even the most adaptive enterprises, upending their best laid plans. Yet, so many Google Cloud customers turned uncertainty into opportunity. They leaned into our serverless solutions to innovate rapidly, in many cases introducing brand new products, and delivering new features to respond to market demands. We were right there with them, introducing over a 100 new capabilities—faster than ever before! I’m grateful for the inspiration our customers provided, and the tremendous energy around our serverless solutions and cloud-native application delivery.

**速度与压缩比如何兼得？压缩算法在构建部署中的优化**  
https://tech.meituan.com/2021/01/07/pack-gzip-zstd-lz4.html  
通常而言，服务发布平台的构建部署的流程（镜像部署除外）会经过构建（同步代码 -> 编译 -> 打包 -> 上传）、部署（下载包 -> 解压到目标机器 -> 重启服务）等步骤。以美团内部的发布平台 Plus 为例，最近我们发现一些发布项在构建产物打包压缩的过程中耗时比较久。如下图所示的 pack 步骤，一共消耗了1分23秒。pack 作为几乎所有需要部署的服务必需步骤，它目前的耗时基本上仅低于编译和构建镜像，因此，为了提高整体构建的效率，我们准备对 pack 打包压缩的步骤进行一轮优化工作。

**腾讯文档表格：大型前端项目架构优化探索之路**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/_OWUjY4q9KkTjxrk59VJSg  
腾讯文档表格是一个非常复杂的业务，它实现了传统 excel 的大部分核心功能，包括函数计算、条件格式、图表、智能分列等；除此之外还支持高效的多人协同编辑；它的代码量百万级别，启动也流程多达十几步。对于大型的项目而言，随着功能模块的增加，整个代码库看起来就像这个数据中心一样。针对这种混乱的局面，如果让我们排查两个机器之间的连接问题是非常困难的。

**Options for styling web components**  
https://nolanlawson.com/2021/01/03/options-for-styling-web-components/  
When I released emoji-picker-element last year, it was my first time writing a general-purpose web component that could be dropped in to any project or framework. It was also my first time really kicking the tires on shadow DOM. In the end, I think it was a natural fit. Web components are a great choice when you want something to be portable and self-contained, and an emoji picker fits the bill: you drop it onto a page, maybe with a button to launch it, and when the user clicks an emoji, you insert it into a text box somewhere.

**Developers vs. Executives: Cloud Native Confusion is Real**  
https://www.lightbend.com/blog/cloud-native-confusion-is-real  
Everyone wants to go cloud native these days. But what does that mean? A truly cloud native application is one that is designed to perform well in a cloud environment. It’s one that takes the advantages and disadvantages of the cloud into account. Running an application on a public cloud or in a Kubernetes cluster doesn’t mean it’s “cloud native” if that application could run as well, if not better, outside of the cloud.

**Lessons learned in incident management**  
https://dropbox.tech/infrastructure/lessons-learned-in-incident-management  
This post goes deeper into some of the lessons Dropbox has learned in incident management. You probably won’t find all of these in a textbook description of an incident command structure, and you shouldn’t view these improvements as a one-size-fits-all approach for every company. (Their usefulness will depend on your tech stack, org size, and other factors.) Instead, we hope this serves as a case study for how you can take a systematic view of your organization’s own incident response and evolve it to meet your users’ needs.

**The Journey from Monolith to Microservices at GitHub**  
https://www.infoq.com/news/2021/01/monolith-microservices-github/  
GitHub needed to fundamentally rethink how they did software development due to all of the different cultures, norms, and technology stacks that their teams brought to the table. They are migrating toward a microservices architecture that enables different teams and systems and technologies to work harmoniously together.

**Comparing Emilua to NodeJS**  
https://emilua.gitlab.io/blog/post/comparing-emilua-to-nodejs/  
Emilua is an execution engine for Lua. It fills a role similar to NodeJS for Javascript. Apart from being an execution engine, the two have leaps and leaps of differences. I believe a good first post for this blog would be to clarify the differences between NodeJS and Emilua. NodeJS is very popular and people try to port its API to different languages.

**Using checksums to verify syncing 100M database records**  
https://sirupsen.com/napkin/problem-14-using-checksums-to-verify/  
A common problem you’ve almost certainly faced is to sync two datastores. This problem comes up in numerous shapes and forms: Receiving webhooks and writing them into your datastore, maintaining a materialized view, making sure a cache reflects reality, ensure documents make it from your source of truth to a search index, or your data from your transactional store to your data lake or column store.

**The Three Owners of an Interface**  
http://beza1e1.tuxen.de/three_owners.html  
When two components interact they need to use the same interface, one as provider of data and one as consumer. It does not matter if you talk about a REST API, function call, or Protobuf definition, one problem is always the same: Who owns the interface? In most cases, there is an intuitive answer but the remaining cases lead to lots of discussions and meetings because thou shalt partition software with respect to Conway's Law.

**V8-RISCV**  
https://github.com/v8-riscv/v8/wiki  
This is an on-going project to develop the RISC-V backend for the V8 JavaScript Engine. After a few months of intensive development, we have built a sufficient MVP (Minimal Viable Product) for the RISC-V64 port, which currently passes over 94% (15,000+) standard V8 test cases using v8-riscv64 simulated build. We have also established a sustainable porting methodology and development best practices that we feel confident invite a broader community participation. We welcome you joining our development effort. Plenty of supports are still needed for a complete and high-performing V8 on RISC-V.
