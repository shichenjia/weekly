**Serverless is Ready, Developers Are Not**  
https://dev.to/aws-builders/serverless-is-ready-developers-are-not-12f9  
We are not ready. We couldn’t possibly be ready. Let’s step back to web development before serverless and cloud: There are Front End and Back End folks. Or at least, job descriptions, brands, courses, our own identities and, well, ourselves. And this cultural paradigm embeds us, change our views and create social dynamics.

https://wattenberger.com/blog/react-and-d3  
When I visualize data on the web, my current favorite environment is using D3.js inside of a React.js application. These two technologies are notoriously tricky to combine. The crux of the issue is that they both want to handle the DOM. Let's start at the beginning, shall we?

**Compiling Containers – Dockerfiles, LLVM and BuildKit**  
https://www.docker.com/blog/compiling-containers-dockerfiles-llvm-and-buildkit/  
How are containers made? Usually, from a series of statements like `RUN`, `FROM`, and `COPY`, which are put into a Dockerfile and built.  But how are those commands turned into a container image and then a running container?  We can build up an intuition for how this works by understanding the phases involved and creating a container image ourselves. We will create an image programmatically and then develop a trivial syntactic frontend and use it to build an image.

**Open sourcing Querybook, Pinterest’s collaborative big data hub**  
https://medium.com/pinterest-engineering/open-sourcing-querybook-pinterests-collaborative-big-data-hub-ba2605558883  
The common starting point for any analysis at Pinterest is an ad-hoc query that gets executed on a SparkSQL, Hive, Presto cluster, or any Sqlalchemy compatible engine. We built Querybook to provide a responsive and simple web UI for such analysis so data scientists, product managers, and engineers can discover the right data, compose their queries, and share their findings. In this post, we’ll discuss the motivation to build Querybook, its features, architecture, and our work to open source the project.

**Redefining what a map can be with new information and AI**  
https://blog.google/products/maps/redefining-what-map-can-be-new-information-and-ai  
Sixteen years ago, many of us held a printout of directions in one hand and the steering wheel in the other to get around— without information about the traffic along your route or details about when your favorite restaurant was open. Since then, we’ve been pushing the boundaries of what a map can do, propelled by the latest machine learning. This year, we’re on track to bring over 100 AI-powered improvements to Google Maps so you can get the most accurate, up-to-date information about the world, exactly when you need it. Here's a snapshot of how we're using AI to make Maps work better for you with a number of updates coming this year.

**张一鸣演讲全文：外部波澜起伏，内心平静如常｜字节跳动9周年**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/eDn4rcdB7to-sD9N-NGySw?spm=a1zp2r.20241016.0.0.149bcda46ZzLJY  
平常心有个直白定义，就是“吃饭的时候好好吃饭，睡觉的时候好好睡觉”。张一鸣说，保持平常心，接受当下的自己，把自己做好，往往就能把事情做好，“平常人也可以做非常事”。他表示，无论是个人、团队还是公司，都应该关注当下，不过分忧虑未来，不纠结过去。脱离平常心的表现，例如随便就All-in，有时候是一种偷懒。对事物的过度抽象，对方法论的过度追求，也是一种贪走捷径，比如使用越来越抽象和高级的词汇。

**李彦宏：熬得过万丈孤独，藏得下星辰大海**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/57z9K39e8DgU_SO44H0ohQ  
我们让平凡人做不平凡的事，从实习生到顶尖科学家，培养了一批又一批具有“务实、自驱、负责到底”品格的人才。过去的21年中，每当百度徘徊在十字路口，我都会问自己，什么能够让你真正制胜未来？我认为就是两方面：一是你信仰什么，What do you really believe in；一是你有多大的决心，your determination。从过去到现在，我们的信仰没有变，我们相信技术可以改变世界。我们也有决心，有耐心。我们熬得过万丈孤独，藏得下星辰大海。推动人类社会发展的核心，是能量和信息，这是第一性原理，也是我们最底层的思考和判断。正如雨果所说，“已经创造出来的东西，比起有待创造的东西来说，是微不足道的”。我们相信创新和创造，我们相信良知、善行，将让这个世界走向阳光地带，走向星辰大海。

**不是管理不重要，而是经营更重要**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/-vBMk4vT5rAAuA30aUUXPQ  
那就是今天对很多企业来讲，主要领导人的主要精力应该上升到经营决策，就是对战略的选择、对形势的判断，这方面是主要工作，而不要再像过去一样管来管去的。不是管理不重要，而是经营更重要。管理怎么办呢？下移给部下就可以了，而主要的领导人得盯着变化。也就是说，经营是“做正确的事”，管理是“正确地做事”。
