**Key data structures and their roles in RenderingNG**  
https://developer.chrome.com/blog/renderingng-data-structures/  
Previous posts in this series gave an overview of the goals, key properties and high-level component pieces of the RenderingNG architecture. Now let's dig into the key data structures that are inputs and outputs to the rendering pipeline.

**When Angular Fails**  
https://sredmond.medium.com/when-angular-fails-a6ed45af8b6f  
If you’ve read any of my other posts, you’ll know that I’m a HUGE fan of Angular. I’ve written quite a few pieces about why I think Angular is great. However, I’m writing this to challenge myself and see when Angular would fail you. What do I mean when I use the word “fail”? To me, failure would mean that something about the framework itself would hinder the development of my product or get in the way more than help.

**Why are hyperlinks blue?**  
https://blog.mozilla.org/en/internet-culture/deep-dives/why-are-hyperlinks-blue/  
I find myself all consumed by the question, WHY are links blue? WHO decided to make them blue? WHEN was this decision made, and HOW has this decision made such a lasting impact?  I turned to my co-workers to help me research, and we started to find the answer. Mosaic, an early browser released by Marc Andreessen and Eric Bina on January 23, 1993, had blue hyperlinks. To truly understand the origin and evolution of hyperlinks though, I took a journey through technology history and interfaces to explore how links were handled before color monitors, and how interfaces and hyperlinks rapidly evolved once color became an option. 

**The Future Is Big Graphs: A Community View on Graph Processing Systems**  
https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2021/9/255040-the-future-is-big-graphs/fulltext  
Graphs are, by nature, 'unifying abstractions' that can leverage interconnectedness to represent, explore, predict, and explain real- and digital-world phenomena. Although real users and consumers of graph instances and graph workloads understand these abstractions, future problems will require new abstractions and systems. What needs to happen in the next decade for big graph processing to continue to succeed?

**Decoding AVIF: A Deep Dive with Cats and Imgproxy**  
https://evilmartians.com/chronicles/decoding-avif-deep-dive-with-cats-and-imgproxy  
AVIF, a child-wonder image format backed by industry giants, is finally reaching wide browser support with Firefox getting fully on board. We are here to investigate whether the successor to WebP lives up to its promise to obliterate JPEG and PNG and how to hop on the AVIF conversion train early with imgproxy—the cutting-edge Martian tool for transforming images on the web. And be warned, this text is primed for cat lovers! Releated: [Why WebKit Supports AVIF But Safari Does Not](https://www.coywolf.news/webmaster/why-webkit-supports-avif-but-safari-does-not/).  

**jsc: My New Best Friend**  
https://furbo.org/2021/08/25/jsc-my-new-best-friend/  
A friend of mine recently pointed me at a well hidden command line tool. In the JavaScript framework used by Safari and other parts of Apple’s products, there is a tool called jsc. It’s a command line interface for JavaScript that uses the same code as the rest of the system.

**Speeding up IndexedDB reads and writes**  
https://nolanlawson.com/2021/08/22/speeding-up-indexeddb-reads-and-writes/  
IndexedDB has a lot of detractors, and I think most of the criticism is justified. The IndexedDB API is awkward, it has bugs and gotchas in various browser implementations, and it’s not even particularly fast, especially compared to a full-featured, battle-hardened, industry-standard tool like SQLite. The new APIs unveiled in IndexedDB v3 don’t even move the needle much.

**IBM Code Engine and IBM Cloudant: Serverless Data and Infrastructure**  
https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/ibm-code-engine-and-ibm-cloudant-serverless-data-and-infrastructure  
One of the great advantages of cloud infrastructure is that it offers the option of trying things out at zero or near-zero cost.

**API Tokens: A Tedious Survey**  
https://fly.io/blog/api-tokens-a-tedious-survey/  
We’re Fly.io. This post isn’t about Fly.io, but you have to hear about us anyways, because my blog, my rules. Our users ship us Docker containers and we transmute them into Firecracker microvms, which we host on our own hardware around the world. With a working Dockerfile, getting up and running will take you less than 10 minutes.

**learning about unit charts**  
https://www.storytellingwithdata.com/blog/2021/8/24/learnings-about-unit-charts  
Last month we challenged you to tackle unit charts. The results were diverse with submissions including waffle charts, all sorts of icons, hexagons, timelines, and more. Many of you commented that this was your first time creating a unit chart, which is not surprising because unit charts aren’t frequently used in the data visualization world. Still, they can be a powerful tool to help your audience engage with your data under the right circumstances. 

**How Data Shapes the Uber Rider App**  
https://eng.uber.com/how-data-shapes-the-uber-rider-app/  
With such a huge user base and wide range of features, support across all geographic regions is a complicated problem to solve. Furthermore, our app keeps expanding with new products, which mandates that the underlying tech also be flexible enough to evolve and support them. Data is the primary tool enabling this. The following article will focus on rider data in particular: how we collect and process it, and how that has informed concrete improvements to the Rider app.

**HTTP/2 in infrastructure: Ambry network stack refactoring**  
https://engineering.linkedin.com/blog/2021/http-2-in-infrastructure--ambry-network-stack-refactoring  
Ambry is LinkedIn's scalable geo-distributed object store. Developed in-house and open sourced in 2016, Ambry stores tens of petabytes of data. At LinkedIn, Ambry is used to store objects like photos, videos, and resume uploads, as well as internal binary data. After years of production use, Ambry has proven to be stable and easy to operate. But there have been challenges along the way, the most recent being around the network bottleneck between the Ambry frontend and storage nodes. In this post, we will explain how we successfully adopted Netty-based HTTP/2 in our infrastructure service to solve the network bottleneck and examine the performance of the new stack.

**A decade and a half of instability: The history of Google messaging apps**  
https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/08/a-decade-and-a-half-of-instability-the-history-of-google-messaging-apps/  
Sixteen years after the launch of Google Talk, Google messaging is still a mess.

**What I'm up to now**  
https://martinfowler.com/articles/202107-what-doing-now.html  
I still have some writing of my own simmering, but I’m keeping it small scale, so that it isn’t a tragedy when its pushed aside for a few weeks. Part of me is frustrated that I can’t tackle a big topic like I used to, but I’ve gained an immense satisfaction from seeing those I’ve helped making an impact on the industry over the years.

**Is Hacker News a Good Predictor of Future Tech Trends?**  
https://jamespotter.dev/hacker-news-tech-trends/  
Hacker News is typically ahead of the mainstream, often by a few years, but you would need to be paying very close attention to catch the early mentions of a new tech trend. Most of the linked posts and comments have very few upvotes and probably wouldn't even make it to the front page.

**Design for Safety, An Excerpt**  
https://alistapart.com/article/design-for-safety-excerpt/  
Antiracist economist Kim Crayton says that “intention without strategy is chaos.” We’ve discussed how our biases, assumptions, and inattention toward marginalized and vulnerable groups lead to dangerous and unethical tech—but what, specifically, do we need to do to fix it? The intention to make our tech safer is not enough; we need a strategy.
