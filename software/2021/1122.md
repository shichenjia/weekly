**Notes on Web3**  
https://society.robinsloan.com/archive/notes-on-web3/  
It’s possible you have, in recent months, seen people writing with excitement (or curiosity, or consternation) about “Web3”. The term imagines the transition of many internet services to a model built around cryptographic tokens, such that ownership and/or control of those services might be divided between their token-holders, a group that might include their users. 

**Individuals matter**  
https://danluu.com/people-matter/  
One of the most common mistakes I see people make when looking at data is incorrectly using an overly simplified model. A specific variant of this that has derailed the majority of work roadmaps I've looked at is treating people as interchangeable, as if it doesn't matter who is doing what, as if individuals don't matter. Individuals matter.

**Browserflow - Automate your work on any website**  
https://browserflow.app/  
Save time by automating repetitive tasks in your own browser or in the cloud. No coding required.

**AI as a creative collaborator**  
https://thesephist.com/posts/ai-collaborator/  
There are undoubtedly many ways to break this apart, but today, I’m finding it helpful to draw a spectrum from AI being used as a tool to AI being treated like a collaborator in our workflows.

**How GitLab automates engineering management**  
https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2021/11/16/engineering-managers-automate-their-jobs/  
For this blog post, I’m sharing a repo that contains just a few of the many scripts that our team members use. These scripts were originally written by engineering manager Rachel Nienaber. Rachel’s Infrastructure team is tasked with the exciting work of coordinating large scale infrastructure and code improvements. The work involves coordinating and sequencing lots of issues and epics, and ensuring the work gets done at just the right time and in the right order. Because of the breadth and scale of the work, she has created a handful of scripts that parse issues and epics in order to gain better visibility into the work that needs to be done.

**GitHub’s developer-first approach to content moderation**  
https://github.blog/2021-11-17-githubs-developer-first-approach-to-content-moderation/  
At GitHub, developers and their interests are at the center of everything we do—including when it comes to moderating content. To maintain a safe, healthy, and inclusive place for software collaboration, we need to ensure our approach to addressing illegal or harmful content suits our developer community. We’re committed to making our content-moderation approach transparent to our users.

**Rethink Modals Management in React**

A small, zero-dependency utility to manage modals for React.

**Understanding why our build got 15x slower with Webpack 5**  
https://engineering.tines.com/blog/understanding-why-our-build-got-15x-slower-with-webpack  
We're Paddy and Eoin, engineers at Tines. This is the story of how a build system issue thoroughly stumped us and eventually took us into the depths of V8 where we learned some surprising things.

**The Gap (Design Engineering)**  
https://css-tricks.com/the-gap-design-engineering/  
Egor Kloos describes a situation where a (purely visual) designer asks for some changes to a component. There is a misunderstanding where the (code monkey) developer implements the change exactly as requested—but really what was required was both a bug fix and a new variation to the component. Because of the skill siloing: problems. Design Engineering is certainly becoming at thing! 

**How to build stunning 3D scenes with React Three Fiber**  
https://varun.ca/modular-webgl/  
This article shows you how to create breathtaking 3D animations using React Three Fiber (R3F). We’ll walk through setting up a stage, creating geometry, adding lighting and enabling post-processing effects. What’s more, you’ll get to learn by recreating the animation below from scratch.

**Some notes on using esbuild**  
https://jvns.ca/blog/2021/11/15/esbuild-vue/  
This has been working mostly ok for me, but sometimes I run into problems. So I wanted to talk about one of those problems, a solution I found (esbuild!), and what I needed to learn to solve the problem (some very basic facts about how npm builds work).Some of the facts in this post might be wrong because still I don’t understand Javascript build systems that well.

**design systems are for user interfaces**  
https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/design-systems-are-for-user-interfaces/  
Design systems are systems of systems, but not all systems are part of the design system. Confused? You’re certainly not alone. This post tries to articulate how my own definition of a design system has recently changed to address some hard-earned lessons.

**Your CSS is an interface**  
https://ericwbailey.design/writing/your-css-is-an-interface/  
Human-friendly CSS is an interface that prioritizes people. It allows someone using your website or web app to easily make modifications to get what they need. This is huge because we can’t know who the person is, or what circumstances they’re experiencing.

**How to get started with property-based testing in JavaScript using fast-check**  
https://jrsinclair.com/articles/2021/how-to-get-started-with-property-based-testing-in-javascript-with-fast-check/  
Property-based testing helps us write better tests, with less code, and greater coverage. This leads to more confidence in our code, and fewer bugs in our applications. But, as always, there’s a price. Property tests take more effort to write, and they take longer to run. Still, I’m convinced that the trade-off is worth it. In this article, we’ll run through an example of how to write property tests using fast-check.

**The Unfulfilled Potential of Serverless**  
https://www.jeremydaly.com/the-unfulfilled-potential-of-serverless/  
Below I’ve tried to add some context to the main points Corey made in his post. As I said, many of his points resonate with me, but hopefully this brings some comfort to those of you that were disheartened by his message. For those of you that have yet to “buy in” to serverless, I simply ask that you keep an open mind. The vision for serverless and its current reality are very different, and like with most things, we’re likely all trying to get to the same place.

**MemQ: An efficient, scalable cloud native PubSub system**  
https://medium.com/pinterest-engineering/memq-an-efficient-scalable-cloud-native-pubsub-system-4402695dd4e7  
In this blog we introduce MemQ (pronounced mem — queue), an efficient, scalable PubSub system developed for the cloud at Pinterest that has been powering Near Real-Time data transportation use cases for us since mid-2020 and complements Kafka while being up to 90% more cost efficient.

**XMPP, A Comeback Story: A 20 Year Old Messaging Protocol For Robust, Private and Decentralized Communications**  
https://takebackourtech.org/xmpp-comeback/  
Everyone loves a comeback story. Can a 20 year old overlooked technology make a comeback as a completely decentralized, free, and scalable technology for the growing masses of people who value freedom and privacy?

**Project Euler**  
https://projecteuler.net/  
Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems. The motivation for starting Project Euler, and its continuation, is to provide a platform for the inquiring mind to delve into unfamiliar areas and learn new concepts in a fun and recreational context.

**Bayesian Optimization Book**  
https://bayesoptbook.com/  
This is a (draft) monograph on Bayesian optimization, which will be published in early 2022 by Cambridge University Press. The book aims to provide a self-contained and comprehensive introduction to Bayesian optimization, starting “from scratch” and carefully developing all the key ideas along the way. The intended audience is graduate students and researchers in machine learning, statistics, and related fields. However, I also hope that practitioners and researchers from more distant fields will find some utility here.

**Pony - Mindful Messaging**  
https://www.ponymessenger.com/  
The rhythm of the day has been broken: the radio, the telephone, the daily newspaper clamor for attention, and amid the host of stimuli to which people are subjected, it becomes more and more difficult to absorb and cope with any one part of the environment, to say nothing of dealing with it as a whole.  
Pony is a messenger that delivers once a day. Pony is designed to give us the space, time, and structure we need to have mindful communication. Our mission is to elevate your correspondence and to foster deep, lasting connections. 

**Experts From A World That No Longer Exists**  
https://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/experts/  
The biggest risk to an evolving system is that you become bogged down by experts from a world that no longer exists. The more evolution you have, the more you should expect that expertise has a shelf life. “The new is always thought odd,” he wrote, “and some of us are so constituted that we can never get over thinking that anything which is new must be [wrong] … The moment one gets into the ‘expert’ state of mind a great number of things become impossible.”

**研发人员的产品观**

产品经理固然要强化自己对需求的精确描述能力和主次的区分能力，但如果研发也具有足够的产品观，沟通成本会更低，而且可以更好的对产品人员容错，坦白说，对于大部分创业公司而言，一个具有非常成熟研发管理能力和经验的产品经理几乎是不太可能出现的（其实巨头里，能把研发管理做到位的产品经理也是凤毛麟角的），大部分产品经理仅仅能从功能角度描述需求，而这，其实是远远不够的。那么，研发人员如何才算拥有产品观，或者说，我认为一个优秀的研发人员应该有怎样的产品素质。
