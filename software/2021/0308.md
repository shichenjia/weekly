**We Sent 304,654 Coding Tests to Developers from 156 Countries – Here’s What We Learned**  
https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/developer-skills-report-insights-from-coding-tests/  
Innovative tech can help alleviate a lot of the unforeseen burdens in this pursuit, but businesses are wary of the risks involved by relying on unfamiliar technologies. To make it easier to process how our world in tech has changed during the past year, I will provide insights into the dataset and emphasize some of the more relevant findings from the report this year.

**The Web’s Missing Interoperability**  
https://stratechery.com/2021/the-webs-missing-interoperability/  
Seventeen years on and there is more user-generated content than ever, in part because it is so easy to generate: you can type an update on Facebook, post a photo on Instagram, make a video on TikTok, or have a conversation on Clubhouse. That, though, points to Web 2.0’s failure: interoperability is nowhere to be found. Twitter, which has awoken from its years-long stupor to launch or announce whole host of new products, provides an excellent lens with which to examine the drivers of this centralization.

**Modernising A Legacy Android App Architecture**  
https://medium.com/bbc-design-engineering/modernising-a-legacy-android-app-architecture-part-three-applying-the-refactor-d9d826088427  
In our case we’re solving an engineering problem whilst trying to maintain product consistency, for now, and although a greenfield opportunity would be wonderful, you can understand it’s a luxury we can’t always afford. What we were able to do is take experiences like the Sounds development as an ideal model and re-apply many of those core techniques and architectural principles in a compressed and accelerated way. This overall story is about how we put this into action, and solved at least some of our problems.

https://discourse.julialang.org/t/ann-symbolics-jl-a-modern-computer-algebra-system-for-a-modern-language/56251  
This reconstruction of the idea of CAS in Julia’s type system is entirely extensible. New term types enable fast symbolic arithmetic on standard and non-standard algebras; add-on libraries like ModelingToolkit build a bridge from symbolics to numerics. Symbolics.jl and its ecosystem will be the common foundation on which the next generation of Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) will be constructed, automatically updated and accelerated through with the growth of this system.

**Design with Code: UXPin Merge Tutorial**  
https://www.uxpin.com/studio/blog/design-with-code-tutorial/  
UXPin Merge lets designers import developer’s existing custom React components in a seamless fashion to create interactive prototypes using real code, which is unlike anything else traditional design tools offer. This eliminates the need for designers to manually maintain a “second” design system within their design tool and instead provides the entire team with a single source of truth. The result? The disconnect between designers and developers is gone when building digital products.
