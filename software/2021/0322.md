**Next 10 years of Node.js — Understanding the needs of the Node.js constituencies**  
https://nodejs.medium.com/next-10-years-of-node-js-understanding-the-needs-of-the-node-js-constituencies-2f95a1df6a6f  
We need your help to make sure the Next 10 years of Node.js are as successful as the first. We are launching a survey, you can take it here to help us do that. To get a bit more context on why this survey is important, read on…. Releated: [V8 release v9.0](https://v8.dev/blog/v8-release-90).

**Rethinking the JavaScript ternary operator**  
https://jrsinclair.com/articles/2021/rethinking-the-javascript-ternary-operator/  
In general, most of us agree that writing clear code is more important than being concise. So it’s understandable that people give ternaries a good, hard squint. But perhaps consider that being clever or overly-concise isn’t the only reason to use a ternary. And I also encourage you to take a good hard look at your if-statements. Just because something is familiar, doesn’t mean it’s safe.

**Moore's Law for Everything**  
https://moores.samaltman.com/  
“Moore’s Law for everything” should be the rallying cry of a generation whose members can’t afford what they want. It sounds utopian, but it’s something technology can deliver (and in some cases already has). Imagine a world where, for decades, everything–housing, education, food, clothing, etc.–became half as expensive every two years.

**RPA Market Size and Popular Vendors in 2021**

If there is one thing developers like less than writing documentation, it's responding to unnecessary escalations.

**Just-In-Time: The Next Generation of Tailwind CSS**  
https://blog.tailwindcss.com/just-in-time-the-next-generation-of-tailwind-css  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3O_3X7InOw8  
[@tailwindcss/jit](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss-jit) is a new experimental library that compiles all of your CSS on-demand as you author your template files, instead of generating your entire stylesheet up front.

**Which color scale to use when visualizing data**  
https://blog.datawrapper.de/which-color-scale-to-use-in-data-vis/  
When visualizing data, you’re almost always working with color – e.g., with different hues (red, yellow, blue) for categories or color gradients (light blue, medium blue, dark blue) for maps.This article gives you an overview of the different color scales.

**语雀思维图子图嵌套的技术思考**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/R9YnZnphESqc2yZ7-jGhew  
语雀产品上决定做子图嵌套是在 2021 年 1 月底，回想起来，当时做出这个决定还是比较纠结的。因为，产品上本就不是想做 XMind，也不想被 XMind 牵着走，更不想背包袱（有了 XMind 的功能，也意味着有了它的包袱）。但无奈的是，在面对一些具体场景时，当时没找到更合适的做法。最终还是硬着头皮上了，好在最终结果上看，我们虽然沿着 XMind 的路径，但貌似走出了一条也许比 XMind 更宽广的道路。

**FlutterWeb 在美团外卖的实践**  
https://tech.meituan.com/2021/03/18/flutterweb-in-meituanwaimai.html  
MTFlutter 已涵盖研发、调试、测试、发布、线上运维及工程管理整套闭环，同时落地了动态化解决方案，支撑了公司多个业务发展。在大前端融合的趋势下，美团外卖商家端持续在探索更优的多端复用方案，通过 MTFlutter 生态的建设，目前 Flutter 技术栈已覆盖商家端 App 中 90%以上的业务，同时具备 Flutter 开发能力的同学也达到 90% 以上。因此，在有足够技术“储备”的前提下，我们能够基于 Flutter 做全平台（Android、iOS、PC、H5）复用的探索。Related: [Flutter 正在被悄悄放弃吗？](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/hDjbMSPNz_D5JeEBMEJZCA)

**从 QuickJS 到 Dart VM：稿定跨端渲染工程的运行时演化**  
https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/357382042  
在稿定科技，我们使用 QuickJS 与 Skia 搭建并落地了自研的 App 端编辑器渲染能力。去年北京的 QCon+ 上，笔者为此做了「基于 QuickJS + Skia 的 GUI 框架」分享。但在短短几个月后，我们就再次升级了这项 QuickJS + Skia 的工程设计，将 Skia 的渲染能力切换到与 Flutter 中的 Dart VM 相集成。本文会介绍这背后的技术演进，共有这么几个部分：QuickJS 方案演化历程，从 QuickJS 到 Dart VM 的探索，Dart VM 迁移实践经验，复盘总结。Releated: [深入剖析 JavaScript 编译器/解释器引擎 QuickJS](https://ming1016.github.io/2021/02/21/deeply-analyse-quickjs/)。

**Creating Patterns With SVG Filters**  
https://css-tricks.com/creating-patterns-with-svg-filters/  
For years, my pain has been not being able to create a somewhat natural-looking pattern in CSS. I mean, sometimes all I need is a wood texture. The only production-friendly solution I knew of was to use an external image, but external images are an additional dependency and they introduce a new complexity. I know now that a good portion of these problems could be solved with a few lines of SVG.

**Integrating Google Maps in React**  
https://sudolabs.io/blog/integrating-google-maps-in-react  
Integrating maps into your app is a highly-demanded feature, especially taking into account the COVID-19 pandemic situation. Like never before, we tend to make online orders even when it comes to ordinary things such as food, clothes, all sorts of goods from supermarkets, etc. And thus, we are generally interested in tracking such things down or looking for a location of a particular place/item of our interest. That is why many of our clients are requesting a map integration in their products.

**Ember.js in 2021 – a beacon of productivity**  
https://simplabs.com/blog/2021/03/12/ember.js-in-2021---a-beacon-of-productivity/  
In this post, I want to make the case for Ember in 2021 and explain why I consider it a beacon of productivity in the middle of a roaring sea of complexity. While everyone is obsessed with change and innovation (often mistaking the former for the latter), Ember allows teams to excel at executing their product vision and focus on shipping instead of getting lost in low-level rabbit holes where little business value is to be found.

**7 Ways to Debug Jest Tests in Terminal**  
https://pragmaticpineapple.com/7-ways-to-debug-jest-tests-in-terminal/  
Welcome, you probably searched how to debug your test with Jest. I am glad you found this blog post because you are about to learn 7 ways to debug Jest tests inside your terminal. Everybody knows that you can do it easily with an IDE like VSCode or WebStorm, but what if you are not using them? How do you go about debugging them? Spoiler alert - it is not with console.log().

**What Does a Database Administrator Actually Do?**  
https://www.brentozar.com/archive/2021/03/what-does-a-database-administrator-actually-do/  
BrentOzar.com is 20 years old, and I’m celebrating by being a little retrospective and future-looking this month. Today, I’m publishing a post that I could have published 10 years ago, or maybe 20 years ago, and maybe even 10 years from now. How much of this would have changed in the past? How much will change in the future? Think about that as you read through this. Here we go…

**Migrating Millions of Concurrent Websockets to Envoy**  
https://slack.engineering/migrating-millions-of-concurrent-websockets-to-envoy/  
Slack has a global customer base, with millions of simultaneously connected users at peak times. Most of the communication between users involves sending lots of tiny messages to each other. For much of Slack’s history, we’ve used HAProxy as a load balancer for all incoming traffic. Today, we’ll talk about problems we faced with HAProxy, how we solved them with Envoy Proxy, the steps involved in the migration, and what the outcome was. Let’s dive in!

**Swift Evolution: Actors**  
https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0306-actors.md  
The actor model defines entities called actors that are perfect for this task. Actors allow you as a programmer to declare that a bag of state is held within a concurrency domain and then define multiple operations that act upon it. Each actor protects its own data through data isolation, ensuring that only a single thread will access that data at a given time, even when many clients are concurrently making requests of the actor. As part of the Swift Concurrency Model, actors provide the same race and memory safety properties as structured concurrency, but provide the familiar abstraction and reuse features that other explicitly declared types in Swift enjoy.

With the release of FreeBSD 13.0 on the horizon, I wanted to see how it shapes up on my Lenovo T450 laptop.  Previous major releases on this laptop, using it as a workstation, felt very rough around the edges but with 13, it feels like the developers got it right.

**curl is 23 years old today**  
https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2021/03/20/curl-is-23-years-old-today/  
curl’s official birthday was March 20, 1998. That was the day the first ever tarball was made available that could build a tool named curl. I put it together and I called it curl 4.0 since I kept the version numbering from the previous names I had used for the tool. Or rather, I bumped it up from 3.12 which was the last version I used under the previous name: urlget.

As new tech companies pop up every day, and as more people plan careers in tech, it can be difficult to choose between so many companies — especially when cool perks, unique experiences, and great benefits are commonplace offerings. But one thing that helps potential team members make their decision, because it truly shows what an organization is really all about, is company values.

**So, why are software engineers better CEOs?**  
https://iism.org/article/so-why-are-software-engineers-better-ceos-60  
From the onset, we have chosen to use one of Wall Street's measures of a better CEO – namely, market cap. In other words, by this measure, CEOs that create the most value are the best CEOs. Sure, there are other measures perhaps more virtuous; but market capital is well-known, generally reliable, and historically trended. So, let’s just roll with it as our measure of “better CEOs” as we have lots to discuss.
