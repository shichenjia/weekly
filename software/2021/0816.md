https://github.blog/2021-08-11-githubs-engineering-team-moved-codespaces/  
GitHub is making Codespaces available to Team and Enterprise Cloud plans on github.com. Codespaces provides software teams a faster, more collaborative development environment in the cloud. Read more on our [Codespaces page](https://github.com/features/codespaces).

**Static vs. Dynamic vs. Jamstack: Where’s The Line?**  
https://css-tricks.com/static-vs-dynamic-vs-jamstack-wheres-the-line/  
You’ll often hear developers talking about “static” vs. “dynamic” sites, or you may have heard someone use the term Jamstack. What do these terms mean, and when does a “static” site become either a Jamstack or dynamic site? These questions sound simple, but they’re more nuanced than they appear. Let’s explore these terms to gain a deeper understanding of Jamstack.

**How We Design Our APIs at Slack**  
https://slack.engineering/how-we-design-our-apis-at-slack/  
Developing your own API style guide can’t completely save you from making crummy decisions or preventing today’s enthusiastic choices becoming tomorrow’s regrets, but they will help you make decisions openly, honestly, and with clarity. In this post, we’ll describe our API design principles, as well as our process for how new APIs are specced, reviewed, and tested. By the end, you should have some ideas that you can take back to your own API process.

**Breaking the web forward**

Safari is holding back the web. It is the new IE, after all. In contrast, Chrome is pushing the web forward so hard that it’s starting to break. Meanwhile web developers do nothing except moan and complain. The only thing left to do is to pick our poison.

**JavaScript needs more helper functions for iteration (map, filter, etc.) – where should we put them?**  
https://2ality.com/2021/08/iteration-helpers.html  
Iteration is a standard that connects operations with data containers: Each operation that follows this standard, can be applied to each data container that implements this standard.

**Introducing MIDIVal: the easiest way to interact with MIDI in your browser**  
https://kulak.medium.com/introducing-midival-f837b2d48185  
Web MIDI API provides an interface to communicate with both input and output MIDI devices, but there is no abstraction layer on top of basic transport methods. To fix this problem, I have created MIDIVal — platform-agnostic library for all your MIDI needs. It provides high-level methods and can greatly simplify your workflow. Moreover, as it was designed to be platform-agnostic in mind, you can use the same code to communicate with your MIDI devices in the browsers ), node.js, and even in React Native (plugin in development).

**Improving responsiveness in text inputs**  
https://nolanlawson.com/2021/08/08/improving-responsiveness-in-text-inputs/  
To understand the source of input delays, let’s take a concrete example. Imagine a Twitter-like UI with a text field and a “remaining characters” count. As you type, the number gradually decreases down to zero.

**前端代码常见的 Provider 究竟是什么**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/VlDfWpKE6GFOnLC_nNxOSA  
不知道你有没有在某处见过 xxProvider，Provider 并不是 23 种经典设计模式之一，但是却应用特别多，可以算是一种比较新的模式。Angular2 中提供了创建对象的时候基于 Provider，VSCode 插件中有各种 registerXxxProvider 的 api，React 提供了 Provider 组件用于 context 数据的传递。还有很多别的地方也经常会见到 Provider 的概念，那么 Provider 究竟是什么呢？

**Shift to Serverless**  
https://www.lightbend.com/blog/shift-to-serverless  
At Lightbend our engineering teams are all about Reactive Systems and that comes with DDD, or Domain Driven Design. Our Product Management team uses DDD too, though as a slightly different abbreviation: Data Driven Decisions. To make better decisions every company needs good data, so we partnered with Channel Media & Market Research to conduct a persona and insights survey. In the survey technical architects, heads of application development or engineering and developers answered a range of questions about how they build applications in their companies.

**Open-sourcing a more precise time appliance**  
https://engineering.fb.com/2021/08/11/open-source/time-appliance/  
The Time Appliance is an important step in the journey to improve the timing infrastructure for everyone, but there is more to be done. We will continue to work on other elements, including improving the precision and accuracy of the synchronization of our own servers, and we intend to continue sharing this work with the Open Compute community.

**OpenAI Codex**  
https://openai.com/blog/openai-codex/  
We’ve created an improved version of OpenAI Codex, our AI system that translates natural language to code, and we are releasing it through our API in private beta starting today. Codex is the model that powers GitHub Copilot, which we built and launched in partnership with GitHub a month ago. Proficient in more than a dozen programming languages, Codex can now interpret simple commands in natural language and execute them on the user’s behalf—making it possible to build a natural language interface to existing applications. We are now inviting businesses and developers to build on top of OpenAI Codex through our API.

**SoundStream: An End-to-End Neural Audio Codec**  
https://ai.googleblog.com/2021/08/soundstream-end-to-end-neural-audio.html  
Audio codecs are used to efficiently compress audio to reduce either storage requirements or network bandwidth. Ideally, audio codecs should be transparent to the end user, so that the decoded audio is perceptually indistinguishable from the original and the encoding/decoding process does not introduce perceivable latency.

**Ultimate Guide on RPA for Cybersecurity with Top 7 Use Cases**  
https://research.aimultiple.com/rpa-for-cybersecurity/  
RPA in cybersecurity is the use of robotic process automation bots to protect businesses from cyber attacks and improve their cybersecurity. RPA bots automate repetitive tasks by replicating human encounters with GUI elements, thus, they limit errors caused by human intervention, reduce human exposure to sensitive data, and reduce the cost of a data breach as you can see below.

同学们，你们还记得百度APP以前的口号吗？对。“有事搜一搜，没事看一看”。你注意到没有，在这首魔性洗脑歌里，百度APP的口号变成了什么？没错。变成了：百度一下，生活更好。还真是。从“搜一搜，看一看”，到“生活更好”。可是，这差别大吗？大了去了。这意味着，百度APP正在，或者至少希望自己，从“搜索引擎”，转型为“决策服务”。是啊。关于互联网公司，我写了很多阿里，腾讯，京东，字节跳动，小米，和美团。很少写百度。今天，我们就借这位同学的问题，聊聊百度。聊聊百度的未来。斗胆。
