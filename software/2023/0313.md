https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/typescripts-migration-to-modules/  
One of the most impactful things we’ve worked on in TypeScript 5.0 isn’t a feature, a bug fix, or a data structure optimization. Instead, it’s an infrastructure change. In TypeScript 5.0, we restructured our entire codebase to use ECMAScript modules, and switched to a newer emit target.

**Why Turborepo is Migrating From Go to Rust**  
https://vercel.com/blog/turborepo-migration-go-rust  
Turborepo is a high-performance build system for JavaScript and TypeScript codebases. We're reimagining build systems, taking inspiration from tools like Buck and Bazel, to make them accessible for everyone. As usage has grown and product needs have shifted, we've decided to start an incremental migration from Go to Rust in the 1.7 version. In this article, you'll learn about our motivations for this migration and problems that we are finding Rust solves for our team.

**反思软件开发：知识流动**  
https://ourai.ws/posts/the-effect-of-knowledge-on-efficiency-part-3/  
一家企业内不仅有人类员工，还有可将工作中各种数字化手段整体看待的数字员工；其中，最高级别的是智能助手，智能工作台承担了这一角色。智能助手能够卓有成效地帮助人类员工解决机械重复性工作，使人们可以专注于创意性内容，真正地从体力密集型变为脑力密集型；它就像是个「贴心」的小秘书，因而不能把它看作奴仆，而是伙伴。由于智能助手的特性，一个需求的出现，一个想法的诞生，它们是否靠谱在输入进去之后的那一刻就能得到初步验证；经过大家共同讨论与修改，敲定后的结论就作为知识在智能助手中留证，并直接看到数字产品的最终成品。

一个人对生活抱有希望和热情朝气蓬勃地活着，这是“上”。在时局的变化中，能够知进退，能舍得，这是“止”。无论何种境遇，都不曾动摇底线，活得问心无愧、坦坦荡荡，这是“正”。能进、能退、能守，能做到这三点，人生又有什么祸患可言呢？
