**The Valley of Code**  
https://thevalleyofcode.com/  
The Valley of Code is a website whose goal is to help you become a Web Developer. The vision for The Valley of Code is to be a website you can always reference and use as “the place where you go learn quickly how to do X” in your day-to-day life as a developer. It’s composed of 2 parts. A free version and a pro, paid version. Both versions are continuously maintained and improved. By becoming a pro member you support the project, get access to the PRO lessons, and get access to a private Discord community.

**Your Website’s URLs Can and Should Be Beautiful**  
https://opuszine.us/posts/your-websites-urls-can-should-be-beautiful  
Put simply, “pretty” URLs make your site more accessible and user-friendly while also providing some SEO benefits. But even if your CMS is configured to create “pretty” URLs, you can still make them better — and more beautiful.

**Patterns of Distributed Systems**  
https://martinfowler.com/books/patterns-distributed.html  
The final book contains thirty patterns, each illustrated with explanatory text, many with sequence diagrams to explain the complex interactions, and all with code samples that clarify the all-important details. Understanding these patterns provides a solid foundation for understanding how distributed systems work.

https://evilmartians.com/chronicles/extremely-open-and-incredibly-close-should-you-go-open-source

**从三个维度读懂习主席这封贺信的深**  
https://baijiahao.baidu.com/s?id=1783585282947260005  
一花独放不是春，百花齐放春满园。有文明的互鉴才能实现共同的进步呃呃。2023年3月15日，习近平主席在中国共产党与世界政党高层对话会上，提出了全球文明倡议。他指出，在各国前途命运紧密相连的今天，不同文明包容共存、交流互鉴，在推动人类社会现代化进程、繁荣世界文明百花园中具有不可替代的作用。

**中医和西医有什么区别？**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/wI4O-9M-2ucrHFp2rb1dzg  
人的正常和反常，是以天地之气作为判准的。万物一体，万物是一个大系统，人这个小系统的运行是不是正常，得看是不是和天地这个大系统相一致。谁有病，谁没病，不是乱说的，是要有依据的，是有一个唯一的确定的颠扑不破的判准的。

**孔子自己是如何力行中庸的**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/b5zP1G4Q88nwu-0pkUn4bw  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/QcdLU4eV2Cz0_FU-7K1EqQ  
子曰：“中庸之为德也，其至矣乎！民鲜久矣。”孔子说：“以中庸来实现道德真是一种至高境界，人们已经很久都做不到了。”整本《论语》中，提到中庸的地方，只有这一句，但是这个方法论却贯彻在整本书里，无处不在，稍后我们用经文举例。那么什么是中庸呢？宋代程颐的解释是：“不偏之谓中，不易之谓庸。”人们常常把中庸理解成为捣糨糊，不问是非各打五十大板，那样的做法是孔子极其反对的“乡愿”。

**《吕祖心经》：天生万物，惟人最灵；非人能灵，实心是灵！**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/eYeC_DYsMyHE_oTew9fyPg  
天生万物，惟人最灵。非人能灵，实心是灵。心为主宰，一身之君。役使百骸，区处群情。物无其物，形无其形。禀受于天，良知良能。气拘欲蔽，日失其真。此心即失，此身亦倾。

**三和书院第六届同有班招生简章**
