**A Historical Reference of React Criticism**  
https://www.zachleat.com/web/react-criticism/  
There have been a number of criticisms levied at the React project over the years, some of them handled and some of them still wavering in the wind. In this post, I’ll summarize the ones that are most prominent in my memory as a way of maintaining a record (primarily for my own use but maybe you’ll find it useful too). Releated: Modularizing React Applications with Established UI Patterns(https://martinfowler.com/articles/modularizing-react-apps.html), [Why I'm not the biggest fan of Single Page Applications](https://www.matuzo.at/blog/2023/single-page-applications-criticism/).  

**Future-Proof Your Code: Top JavaScript Frameworks to Watch in 2023**  
https://blog.greenroots.info/future-proof-your-code-top-javascript-frameworks-to-watch-in-2023  
JavaScript is omnipresent. The web runs on JavaScript, and there are plenty to chose from. But how? Let's learn.

**The evolution of Facebook’s iOS app architecture**  
https://engineering.fb.com/2023/02/06/ios/facebook-ios-app-architecture/  
FBiOS was never intentionally architected this way. The app’s codebase reflects 10 years of evolution, spurred by technical decisions necessary to support the growing number of engineers working on the app, its stability, and, above all, the user experience. Now, to celebrate the codebase’s 10-year anniversary, we’re shedding some light on the technical decisions behind this evolution, as well as their historical context.

**An important next step on our AI journey**  
https://blog.google/technology/ai/bard-google-ai-search-updates/  
AI is the most profound technology we are working on today. Whether it’s helping doctors detect diseases earlier or enabling people to access information in their own language, AI helps people, businesses and communities unlock their potential. And it opens up new opportunities that could significantly improve billions of lives. That’s why we re-oriented the company around AI six years ago — and why we see it as the most important way we can deliver on our mission: to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful.

**Speeding up the JavaScript ecosystem - eslint**  
https://marvinh.dev/blog/speeding-up-javascript-ecosystem-part-3/  
Linting is the act of finding patterns in code that could lead to mistakes or ensure a consistent reading experience. It's a core piece of many JavaScript/TypeScript projects. We found lots of potential for time savings in their selector engine and AST conversion process and a perfect linter written in JS would be able to hit sub-second run times.

**Bringing Javascript to WebAssembly for Shopify Functions**  
https://shopify.engineering/javascript-in-webassembly-for-shopify-functions  
While we’re working on getting our Shopify Functions infrastructure ready for the public beta, we thought we’d use this opportunity to shine some light on how we brought JavaScript to WebAssembly, how we made everything fit within our very tight Shopify Function constraints, and what our plans for the future look like.

**A Gentle Introduction to CRDTs**  
https://vlcn.io/blog/gentle-intro-to-crdts.html  
Conflict Free Replicated Data types (CRDTs) can be tricky. You may spend months reading papers and implementing different algorithms before they finally click and become simple. That or they'll seem simple out of the gate and you'll be missing a bunch of nuance.

**What Is API-First Design?**  
https://blog.postman.com/api-first-design-traits-postman/  
An API-first strategy involves leveraging APIs to save time and money and deliver maximum value. API-first design can help organizations achieve that goal by improving the overall quality of their APIs. But what does API-first design look like, and how does it relate to the API design-first model? Let’s dive in.

**Visual design rules you can safely follow every time**  
https://anthonyhobday.com/sideprojects/saferules/  
You do not have to follow these rules every time. If you have a good reason to break any of them, do. But they are safe to follow every time.

**All Programming Philosophies Are About State**  
https://www.worldofbs.com/minimize-state/  
What this shows is that every programming philosophy is about how to manage state, and each philosophy comes with trade-offs. What this means is that there is no "one true way" to deal with state, and that each programming philosophy is useful and important in the correct domain. It also shows how important minimizing state is.

**Three layers to secure a software development organization**  
https://stackoverflow.blog/2023/02/09/three-layers-to-secure-a-software-development-organization/  
This affects the individual developer writing insecure code, the engineering team blindly trusting their dependencies, and the organization thinking that their best bet is to roll their own security controls.

In this post, I’ll share what I’ve learned about being a bootstrapped founder from my fifth year at it.

**Software Capabilities Vs Features**  
https://alexturek.com/2023-02-10-software-capabilities-vs-features/  
There’s a lot of work invisible to end-users in software. A big time sink is extending the software’s capabilities, which are non-user-visible technical infrastructure that allow the software to do more stuff. As somebody who works with or depends on software engineers, asking for time estimates on building new things can be a nerve-wracking experience. You can get a bunch of estimates back that are on the orders of hours or days, and then a surprise one that’s weeks or months.

入门无非诚信，根本不外清静！其它不是修行！诚者，不二之心；信者，不疑之志。清者，不迷之念；静者，不妄之神。

**追求富贵易，不招惹因果难**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/cVrWra-2Q32QJCuQrvVXng  
既追求富贵，又不招惹因果，我以为就在三个限制条件上：一是走正道，二是靠勤奋，三是能知足。走正道能获得的，才是你该得的，你能守得住的，而不再是“过路财”，没有副作用。你想多得到一点，那就只能依靠勤奋，再没有别的。如果不是天赋很高且时运很好，大部分人所能得到的，还是比不了唯利是图者，与自己的希望还是有差距，所以最后还需要一个知足。因为富贵可以追求，但不能强求。三个条件下所能给到你的，那就是你的命。
