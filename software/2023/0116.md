**JSONQL 低代码数据模型引擎的设计与实现**  
https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/597981519  
在低代码产品中，后端最重要的功能是数据模型，它的能力决定了低代码平台可以开发应用的上限，之前在介绍低代码实现原理时列举过几种实现方式，其中只有第一个动态 ORM 方案支持对接已有数据库，这个方案比其它方案的灵活性和性能都更好，能制作的应用上限最高，因此爱速搭里首先实现的就是这个方案。本文将介绍爱速搭中数据模型的实现细节，以及其中最重要的 JSONQL 语言。另附：[Low Code for Smart Software Development](https://modeling-languages.com/low-code-smart-software/)。

**Is TypeScript worth it?**  
https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34359504  
I have been using TypeScript for a few years now, and I haven't yet been convinced that I would choose to use it if I had the choice; not just for my own personal projects but for large scale applications where the codebase is shared with many developers. I want to skip over the static typing benefits argument, because I think it is well understood that static typing is a good thing and if we could bless JavaScript with a built-in and robust typing system then I don't think many people would be against that. My issue is with the amount of extra work it places on developers, much of it the "dumb" kind of work which can eat up hours and doesn't deliver all that much value.

**Microfrontends Anti-Patterns: Seven Years in the Trenches**

Luca Mezzalira discusses common anti-patterns he has seen in the past seven years of implementing and consulting multiple companies in their journey into the microfrontends architecture.

**Node.js was the top technology used by professional developers in 2022**  
https://nodesource.com/blog/Nodejs-Retro-2022  
Stack Overflow’s annual Developer Survey confirmed our experience; Node.js continues to grow its use across the globe due to its scalability and performance as well as its ability to integrate seamlessly with a wide range of technologies and databases make it an ideal technology for businesses of all sizes.

**Architecture diagrams should be code**  
https://brianmckenna.org/blog/architecture_code  
For the past few years I’ve been the most senior developer on my teams in Atlassian, in both position (Principal Engineer) and time (almost 9 years) - this means I usually take on the responsibility of managing our software architecture. Architecture is the relationships between systems, which can be fairly tricky to talk about. Probably the best form of communication is a diagram, with boxes representing systems (or components) and lines representing relationships between them. This can still have issues.

**Conditional CSS**  
https://ishadeed.com/article/conditional-css/  
In this article, I will go over a few CSS features that we use every day, and show you how conditional they are. In addition to that, I will compare a few examples where CSS is much more powerful than design tools. Releated: [3D in CSS](https://garden.bradwoods.io/notes/css/3d).  

**useAsyncEffect: The Missing React Hook**  
https://marmelab.com/blog/2023/01/11/use-async-effect-react.html  
Using the useEffect hook to trigger asynchronous side effects is a common React pattern. But it's not as simple as it looks, and more specifically, it's easy to do it wrong and introduce bugs in your application. In this post, I'll explain why, and I'll introduce useAsyncEffect, a React hook that allows you to run asynchronous side effects in React the simple way.

**Regulate Web3 Apps, Not Protocols Part II: Framework for Regulating Web3 Apps**  
https://a16zcrypto.com/regulate-web3-apps-not-protocols-part-ii-framework-for-regulating-web3-apps/  
The effective regulation of web3 apps is a significant undertaking. It requires a reassessment of existing regulatory schemes, a deep understanding of web3 technology, and a delicate balancing of policy objectives. Undertaking these tasks is of critical importance. If web3 apps remain soulbound to pre-existing regulatory frameworks applicable to traditional businesses without any room for reevaluation and technical nuance, the evolution of the Internet in the United States will be halted dead in its tracks. Outdated “red flag acts” must be re-thought and new regulations must be implemented to meet policy objectives.

**The yaml document from hell**  
https://ruudvanasseldonk.com/2023/01/11/the-yaml-document-from-hell  
For a data format, yaml is extremely complicated. It aims to be a human-friendly format, but in striving for that it introduces so much complexity, that I would argue it achieves the opposite result. Yaml is full of footguns and its friendliness is deceptive. In this post I want to demonstrate this through an example. This post is a rant, and more opinionated than my usual writing.

**AI and the Big Five**  
https://stratechery.com/2023/ai-and-the-big-five/  
The story of 2022 was the emergence of AI, first with image generation models, including DALL-E, MidJourney, and the open source Stable Diffusion, and then ChatGPT, the first text-generation model to break through in a major way. It seems clear to me that this is a new epoch in technology. Releated:

**Everything I needed to know about tech, I learned from Tolkien, part two**  
https://newrelic.com/blog/nerd-life/it-tolkien-part-two  
If you've read my other essays you can probably guess this isn't the end. It's merely a pause in the narration. There are far more lessons for we IT workers, both in the pages of Tolkien's "legendarium" and elsewhere. It seems our travels are part of one long road after all.

**为什么我们常说做to C 的人比较难去做to B ？**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/7_n2Oizlh3LsRSXiHkHtJA  
前几天在线下大课的私享会上，有个同学问了个问题。他本来一直是做to C软件系统的，积累了很多经验。他发现很多公司也需要这样的系统，他想把能力和经验包装起来，卖给这些公司，问我应该怎么做才能够快速打开市场？我说，你要想快速打开市场，靠你自己是不行的，你应该组建个团队来帮助你，而且这个团队应该是由从SAP、华为、微软或者IBM这样的公司出来的、销售经验丰富的人组建的。
他说难道就不能放到网上来卖？这不是更方便，也不用做那么重了。我说，因为你做了很长时间的to C产品，可能对to B行业不太了解。

本文为译文，来自海外的商业观察博客 Every.to， 原文较长，火箭君做了编辑和节选。原文作者给出了一个很大胆的观点：他认为 AI （LLM/GPT）可能会让我们不再需要自己整理笔记，并预测了笔记类工具的未来。其中很多见解和火箭君不谋而合，但是对于我们自己是否需要整理笔记，我还是有些不同的观点，也将会附在译文最后。

**中国，奇妙在哪里？**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/r34hmyQDXM2W5LaMWZgF_Q  
都说，一个人，性格决定命运。这样看来，一个民族的性格也决定一个民族的命运。《奇妙中国》也是我自己窥探我们这个民族性格的旅程。把这些工程串联在一起，不难看出，中国人着迷的还是高效的劳动和生产，便利的交通，最后奔个好日子。中国所有的奇迹，来自于人的勤勉和奋斗。尤其在这个时候看，这艰辛的一年结尾的时刻，一起感受我们这个民族独特的性格。一个这样的中国，再怎么样都不会差的。大概，这就是奇妙中国。

**解读被人误解的道法自然！**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/uGJNr-7EaBnA0QGMTuIi9A  
对中国人而言，其人生哲学的理论来源无非是儒、释、道三家。儒家提倡存心养性，释家提倡明心见性，道家提倡修心炼性，三教无外乎都重在一个心字。用通俗的 话来讲，即儒家让人拿得起，释家让人放得下，道家让人想得通。“拿起”与“放下”，是一种人生态度，而“想得通”则是一种人生智慧。所谓智慧地面对人生， 就是不必刻意于有为或无为，而是在面对任何事情或境遇的时候能随遇而安，顺势而为，保持一种愉悦的心情、平和的心态、豁达的心胸。道家用四个字为这种人生智慧提供源源不断的给养，即“道法自然”。
