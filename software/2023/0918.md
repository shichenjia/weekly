**Death by a thousand microservices**  
https://renegadeotter.com/2023/09/10/death-by-a-thousand-microservices.html  
https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37477095  
There is a pretty well-known sketch in which an engineer is explaining to the project manager how an overly complicated maze of microservices works in order to get a user’s birthday - and fails to do so anyway. The scene accurately describes the absurdity of the state of the current tech culture. We laugh, and yet bringing this up in a serious conversation is tantamount to professional heresy, rendering you borderline un-hirable. How did we get here? How did our aim become not addressing the task at hand but instead setting a pile of cash on fire by solving problems we don’t have? Additional reading:

A lightweight and versatile open source server that simplifies the application stack by natively executing application code across eight different programming language runtimes.

**We're still not innovating with AI-generated UI.**  
https://heather-buchel.com/blog/2023/09/ai-generated-ui-is-not-innovative/  
No tool that asserts you can build production-grade UI code from their AI is innovative if it's not driven by accessibility. It's also not production-grade if the code it generates is inaccessible. That is the short and sweet of it. Not everyone is claiming that their AI tool is particularly innovative. But like most things involving AI right now, we are seeing some pretty wild claims.

## 深阅读

**User Interviews 101**  
https://www.nngroup.com/articles/user-interviews/  
User interviews help you learn who your users are, what their experiences are like, and what they need, value, and desire.

**Multi-page web apps**  
https://adactio.com/journal/20442  
I may be committing a fundamental attribution error here, but I think that we’ve reached this point not because of any consideration for users, but rather because of how it makes us developers feel. Perhaps building an old-fashioned website that uses HTML for navigations feels too easy, like it’s beneath us. But building an “app” that requires JavaScript just to render text on a screen feels like real programming.

**JavaScript WTF: Why does every() return true for empty arrays?**  
https://humanwhocodes.com/blog/2023/09/javascript-wtf-why-does-every-return-true-for-empty-array/  
How can a condition be satisified when there aren't any values to test?

**cola: a text CRDT for real-time collaborative editing**  
https://nomad.foo/blog/cola  
In this blog post I’ll talk about the theoretical background and the technical implementation of cola, a text CRDT for real-time collaborative editing written in Rust. Reading this is not at all necessary to be able to use cola, so if that’s all you’re interested in you can safely skip this post and go straight to the documentation. Releated:

**My Node.js is a bit Rusty**  
https://gal.hagever.com/posts/my-node-js-is-a-bit-rusty  
Replacing an internal Node.js module with a native Rust module made a x25 perf boost. Let’s understand why. 

**An Internet of PHP**  
https://timotijhof.net/posts/2023/an-internet-of-php/  
PHP is big. The trolls can proclaim its all-but-certain “death” until the cows come home, but no amount of heckling changes that the Internet runs on PHP. The evidence is overwhelming. What follows is a loosely organised collection of precisely that evidence.

**How Query Engines Work**  
https://howqueryengineswork.com/  
Since starting my first job in software engineering, I have been fascinated with databases and query languages. It seems almost magical to ask a computer a question and get meaningful data back efficiently. After many years of working as a generalist software developer and an end-user of data technologies, I started working for a startup that threw me into the deep end of distributed database development. This is the book that I wish had existed when I started on this journey. Although this is only an introductory-level book, I hope to demystify how query engines work.

**Last Mile Data Processing with Ray**  
https://medium.com/pinterest-engineering/last-mile-data-processing-with-ray-629affbf34ff  
In this blogpost, we will share our assessment of the ML developer velocity bottlenecks and delve deeper into how we adopted Ray, the open source framework to scale AI and machine learning workloads, into our ML Platform to improve dataset iteration speed from days to hours, while improving our GPU utilization to over 90%.

**Why I Help Maintain a 3000-year-old Geoglyph**  
https://longnow.org/ideas/why-i-help-long-now-london-maintain-a-3000-year-old-geoglyph/  
Across cultures and across time, group rituals endure because they are about not just the activity itself, but the maintenance of a community and connections between geographically distributed groups, people, and ideas.

**We built the fastest CI in the world. It failed. Here’s what we learned**  
https://earthly.dev/blog/shutting-down-earthly-ci/  
Back in April 2020, we at Earthly set out on this quest to improve CI/CD tooling. We dared to ask questions like “What if the CI could run on your laptop?” And “what would the fastest CI system on the planet look like?” With these questions in mind, we came to a pretty strange, but pretty interesting answer… the build system and the CI need to be the same. And it needs to be distributed. Now we all know dreaming big is easy. Execution is where things get hard.

**产品并非功能之和，如何有效干预一个系统**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/VsCP33HKrOEEMSWAVkVxmA  
刚开始设计产品时，认为产品是静态的功能之和；经营产品时间久了，就会意识到产品是一个系统。对于一个系统来说，想要达到某个目的，直接修改某些功能，未必会得到想要的结果，比如想要提高付费转化率，不能只去增加购买按钮的尺寸，而是需要去调整系统中其他的部分，比如通过促销、通过捆绑销售、通过抵扣等等手段。随着我们理解的「系统」越大，可以运用的手段就越多。但难点在于，到底哪种手段成本低但收益大，便是本文所探讨的问题。

**有用的功业要跨越周期，必有无用的本源**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/Qp1FCMK5zHOahftCtlN2Pw 
中华文明绵延数千年又崛起，不只是因为一朝一代的兵力强、人口众、疆域广、山河险，更主要的是因为有着大本源的“道”。是“道”，在暗中一直默默核聚变着生生不息的浑厚能量，在背后一直支撑着与维系着中华文明的活力与凝聚力。在这方面，人，家族，企业，组织，社会，文明，其实背后的逻辑都是一样的。当我们以大历史的视野与大哲学的思维来观察人世间的种种变迁，就会发现，有用之用的“剑”再锋利，也很容易在时间长河里日渐钝化、生锈与腐蚀掉，唯有无用之用的”道“却可以穿越时间周期、跨越时代而历久弥新。

**深刻回答“中华文明何以伟大”的重大课题**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/QJBbIRmR2fVhbHG3slyK0Q  
中华文明源远流长、博大精深，是中华民族独特的精神标识，是当代中国文化的根基，是维系全世界华人的精神纽带，也是中国文化创新的宝藏。中华文明有什么特殊之处？中华文明究竟何以伟大？中华文明突出的连续性、创新性、统一性、包容性、和平性，既清晰展示了中华文明的整体面貌，又深刻揭示了中华文明的特殊优势，是坚定文化自信的历史支撑。
