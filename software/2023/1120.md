**A faster web in 2024**  
https://rviscomi.dev/2023/11/a-faster-web-in-2024/  
So with 2024 around the corner, I wanted to take a closer look at what it’s going to take to carry this momentum forward and continue making the web even faster. But there’s a catch. The metric we use to measure interaction responsiveness is changing in 2024. And this new metric is finding a lot of responsiveness issues that have been flying under the radar. Will we be able to meet this new challenge? Will we be able to do so while keeping pace with the performance improvements of 2023? I think so, but we’re going to need to learn some new tricks.

**How Deco.cx, Brazil's top frontend platform, uses Deno Subhosting to move fast and serve their clients' storefronts even faster**  
https://deno.com/blog/deco-cx-subhosting-serve-their-clients-storefronts-fast  
Despite being around for a year and having already onboarded some of Brazil’s biggest brands, Deco.cx plans to expand beyond e-commerce. “We want to be the web editor where you don’t have to choose between full code and no-code,” Guilherme says. “Deno has given us the speed and flexibility to pursue these big ideas.”

**Organizational principles for effective software product development**  
https://sollecitom.github.io/software-product-development-blog/posts/2023/2023-11-16-organizational-principles-for-effectiveness/  
I often rant about what I feel is wrong with an approach, practice, or system. Today, instead, I want to describe some principles that an effective software product development company should adopt. Why principles? Wouldn’t a detailed description of how things should work be more useful? It’d be almost impossible to write, as it’d be a colossal task. Perhaps it’d be good for a book, but definitely not for a blog post. Also, reality is multifaceted and nuanced. Everything depends on everything. Prescriptive approaches don’t cope well with dynamic situations. Principles, on the other hand, allow you to deal with uncertainty.

**Will AI Render Programming Obsolete?**

It's exhilarating to think that, with the help of generative AI, anyone who can write can also write pr[ograms. It’s not so simple. Releated:

**HTML Web Components: An Example**  
https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2023/html-web-components-an-example/  
There are different ways to use web components. One way of using them requires JavaScript in order for them to “run” and display anything in the browser. An alternate way of using them allows you to display information/content in the browser before any JavaScript executes, and then you use web component structured JavaScript[1] to enhance what’s already on display. In an attempt to explain this more, let’s use an simplified example. Releated: [HTML Web Components](https://gomakethings.com/html-web-components/).  

**Exploring V8's strings: implementation and optimizations**  
https://iliazeus.github.io/articles/js-string-optimizations-en/  
JavaScript was always, in one way or another, a text manipulation language - from early web page HTML to modern compilers and tooling. Not a surprise, then, that quite a lot of time was spent tuning and optimizing the string value handling in most modern JS engines. In this article, I will focus on V8's implementation of strings. I will demonstrate various string optimizations by beating C++ in a totally 100% legit benchmark. Finally, I will demonstrate the ways in which these implementation details might actually perform worse, and how to deal with that.

**减少复杂度：软件行业的虚假诺言**  
https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/665064842  
在软件开发中，很多人赞扬“简化”是一种美德，他们劝说我们应该避免复杂度，减少复杂度；然而，现实情况告诉我这样的建议十分不可靠。实际上，我认为这种建议不仅无效，是废话；而且可能会带来负面影响。我尝试来说下真相是什么。

**稳定性，难的不是技术，而是**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/9rAhbG6lu-flNIGQEF5w0g  
作为一个惹出过和处理过一些严重故障的人，我仍然觉得要做好稳定性，最难的并不是技术，或者更准确的说，技术上在怎么做好稳定性，从代码到设计到变更，都有全面的指导思想和原则，包括大家如果去看很多的故障复盘，在改进措施上基本会看到各种类似的话，但这些思想和原则要落地好，是很复杂的话题，有能力要求，还有更重要的是投入要求，而且并没有银弹级产品说做某件事，或安装一个什么软件，就可以保障稳定性了。

**A Coder Considers the Waning Days of the Craft**  
https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/11/20/a-coder-considers-the-waning-days-of-the-craft  
Coding has always felt to me like an endlessly deep and rich domain. Now I find myself wanting to write a eulogy for it. So maybe the thing to teach isn’t a skill but a spirit. I sometimes think of what I might have been doing had I been born in a different time. The coders of the agrarian days probably futzed with waterwheels and crop varietals; in the Newtonian era, they might have been obsessed with glass, and dyes, and timekeeping. 

**张伯礼院士：年轻人少熬夜 不要过度消耗自己**  
https://baijiahao.baidu.com/s?id=1781964194462770975  
张伯礼院士表示：“我也注意到现在很多年轻人喜欢天天熬夜，基本上靠喝咖啡撑着，所以很多年轻人到了40多岁就容易出现心脑血管疾病，这是以健康为代价在消耗生命，非常不应该！”“特别发自内心地忠告他们这些喜欢熬夜的年轻人，健康、事业的双丰收一定是以身体的健康为基础的。”张伯礼院士特别强调，千万不要过度消耗自己的健康，以牺牲健康为代价换取事业进步，非常不值得提倡。
