**CSS Wrapped: 2023!**  
https://developer.chrome.com/blog/css-wrapped-2023?hl=en  
From #Interop2023 to many new landings in the CSS and UI space that enable capabilities developers once thought impossible on the web platform. Now, every modern browser supports container queries, subgrid, the :has() selector, and a whole plethora of new color spaces and functions. We have support in Chrome for CSS-only scroll-driven animations and smoothly animating between web views with view transitions. And to top it all off, there are so many new primitives that have landed for better developer experiences like CSS nesting and scoped styles.

**omg.lol: an oasis on the internet**

https://home.omg.lol/  
I can’t explain it but when you join omg.lol you join a community of the nicest, most interesting people. This service just seems to bring the old-internet lovers together and, I don’t know, it’s just fun and pleasant. If Mastodon is not your thing, that’s cool! There’s also an IRC with a bridge to Discord so you can chat with other members. I’m a lurker most of the time, but I will say that when I do participate in chat I feel immediately welcomed.

**Reclaiming the Web with a Personal Reader**  
https://olano.dev/2023-12-12-reclaiming-the-web-with-a-personal-reader/  
I’ve been using feedi as my “front page of the internet” for a few months now. Beyond convenience, by using a personal reader I’m back in control of the information I consume, actively on the lookout for interesting blogs and magazines, better positioned for discovery and even surprise.

**SoftwareAndEngineering**  
https://martinfowler.com/bliki/SoftwareAndEngineering.html  
Throughout my career, people have compared software development to “traditional” engineering, usually in a way to scold software developers for not doing a proper job. As someone who got his degree in Electronic Engineering, this resonated with me early in my career. But this way of thinking is flawed because most people have the wrong impression of how engineering works in practice.

**FunSearch: Making new discoveries in mathematical sciences using Large Language Models**  
https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/funsearch-making-new-discoveries-in-mathematical-sciences-using-large-language-models/  
Today, in a paper published in Nature, we introduce FunSearch, a method to search for new solutions in mathematics and computer science. FunSearch works by pairing a pre-trained LLM, whose goal is to provide creative solutions in the form of computer code, with an automated “evaluator”, which guards against hallucinations and incorrect ideas. By iterating back-and-forth between these two components, initial solutions “evolve” into new knowledge. The system searches for “functions” written in computer code; hence the name FunSearch.

**Unbundling the Game Engine: The Rise of Next Generation 3D Creation Engines**  
https://a16z.com/unbundling-the-game-engine/  
There is a unique window of opportunity today for a new 3D Creation Engine (aka game engine) to revolutionize the way we create games, film, virtual worlds, and simulations. Unity, Unreal, Roblox and Godot – the predominant 3D engines – are all 15+ year old technologies architected for a different era of computing. The emergence of generative AI, cloud computing, and new spatial platforms is poised to disrupt 3D creation end-to-end. And, in the case of Unity, the damaged trust from their recent pricing change execution has left the community seeking alternatives.

**Database Fundamentals**  
https://tontinton.com/posts/database-fundementals/  
There is a lot more to talk about databases, be it the use of O_DIRECT in linux and implementing your own page cache, failure detection in distributed systems, consensus algorithms like raft, distributed transactions, leader election, and an almost infinite amount more. I hope I have piqued your curiosity enough to explore the world of databases further, or provided the tools for you to better understand which database to pick in your next project

**UX/UI Design Trends Going Into 2024**  
https://blog.prototypr.io/ux-ui-design-trends-going-into-2024-ca43a839b541  
Every year, we have a line up of new design trends that not only look good, but also stick around and influence other designers to “steal” the trend. Love it or hate it, there are actually some design waves that are smart and functional. These functions could range from including more information in less space, to build more engagement with the users. Let’s have a look at some of these trends that are here to stay and are taking over the internet!

**Product Managers vs Product Leaders**  
https://www.svpg.com/product-managers-vs-product-leaders/  
One of the consequences of these articles, and the resulting discussions, is that I’ve had several really thoughtful conversations with people ranging from individual contributor product managers up to CEO’s.  As so often happens, the discussions after an article help me to more clearly understand how people think about these topics, which then helps me to find better ways of explaining.
