**Software disenchantment**  
https://tonsky.me/blog/disenchantment/  
You’ve probably heard this mantra: “Programmer time is more expensive than computer time.” What it means basically is that we’re wasting computers at an unprecedented scale. Would you buy a car if it eats 100 liters per 100 kilometers? How about 1000 liters? With computers, we do that all the time.

**Becoming a good engineer is about collecting experience.**  
https://addyosmani.com/blog/collect-experience/  
Skill cross-pollination isn't just serendipity; it's engineering elegance. The best solutions often come from pairing unexpected techniques So the next time you find yourself wrestling with a new problem, delve into your toolbox of experience. You might find that the solution isn’t just in mastering a new tool but in cleverly using the tools you’ve gathered over the years. It's this layered, nuanced approach to problem-solving that truly marks career progression and sets you apart as an engineer.

**Web Components Will Outlive Your JavaScript Framework**

If we want that sort of longevity, we need to avoid dependencies that we don’t control and stick to standards that we know won’t break. If we want our work to be accessible in five or ten or even 20 years, we need to use the web with no layers in between. For all its warts, the web has become the most resilient, portable, future-proof computing platform we’ve ever created — at least, if we build with that in mind.

**Why you should probably be using SQLite**  
https://www.epicweb.dev/why-you-should-probably-be-using-sqlite  
However, in recent years SQLite has received a great deal of development and attention making it a simple database for even more advanced use cases. Let’s talk about some of those advancements and why for most of us, SQLite is the best balance of trade-offs.

**How to Think Computationally about AI, the Universe and Everything**  
https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/10/how-to-think-computationally-about-ai-the-universe-and-everything/  
Human language. Mathematics. Logic. These are all ways to formalize the world. And in our century there’s a new and yet more powerful one: computation. And for nearly 50 years I’ve had the great privilege of building an ever taller tower of science and technology based on that idea of computation. And today I want to tell you some of what that’s led to. Releated:

**Today was a great day for accessibility!**  
https://christianheilmann.com/2023/10/25/today-was-a-great-day-for-accessibility/  
Today was a great day, even when it started at four in the morning to get to the airport in time. WeAreDevelopers LIVE is a series of online events covering a specialist topic. And today we ran the event with one of my favourite topics of all time: accessibility.

**Unified Versus Split Diff**

**Base64 Encoding, Explained**  
https://www.writesoftwarewell.com/base64-encoding-explained/  
Base64 is an elegant way to convert binary data to text, making it easy to store and transport. This article covers the basics of Base64 encoding, including what it is, how it works and why it's important. It also shows how to encode and decode Base64 data in various programming languages.

**Ways to Keep Software Working**  
https://codefol.io/posts/ways-to-keep-software-working/  
Various possibly-heroes showing off silly but impressive tricks. Yes, But What Do They Add to the Bottom Line? I can talk about keeping software working and why we care and theorise all I like. But normally people have something decent working on the ground long before the theorists catch up. What’s working on the ground? How do we currently keep software working? I’m writing this with an eye toward individual software developers keeping things working by themselves, which says a few things about methods and budget. So let’s look!

**The power of green computing**  
https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/10/23/1081969/the-power-of-green-computing/  
Sustainable computing practices have the power to both infuse operational efficiencies and greatly reduce energy consumption, says Jen Huffstetler, chief product sustainability officer at Intel.

**聿修厥德——一带一路一呼百应的原因**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/GnbjzEenw86SblWPz4OoXg  
在国际时局风云变幻的今天，在全球面临霸道和王道生死抉择的当下，有超过150个国家给中国投下了信任票，积极参与中国的一带一路建设计划。十年绸缪，一朝亮剑，中国主导的人类命运共同体气场全开。那么，中国何德何能使诸国归心，不惧西方强权公开表示支持呢？

**“ 左病右治 ” 背后的深层逻辑**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/ha0K6wZ9dpHEhDfjqzVfKA  
所谓的治左，治右，并不单纯的是方向性的左右，而是说要找到根本。中医认为人是一个有机的整体，人的经脉血液贯通而成，循环往复，周流不殆，就跟河流是一样的，之所以左病右治，是想说明，左边病了，很有可能根源在右边，并不是人们所理解的左手病了治右手那样。左病右治，右病左治的理论基础是根据 “ 气反 ” 而来。“ 气反 ”就是它的背后深层逻辑！

**反向养生最致命！最适合中国人体质的饮食原则是什么？**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/OonVyOqwRXMncq-6mw4chg  
吃饭或者疗愈这类与人有关的事，并不是考试卷，不存在标准答案。每个人的身体不同，就像是不同的锁，要配不同的钥匙。其复杂程度可想而知，并非一篇推文所能承载的。不过，你也不用太着急。因为每篇推文我们都力求抓住本质，带着大家跳出来表层的条条框框，去解决根本问题。比如这一次是抛去复杂的食物搭配，聚焦在食物吸收问题上，从形气神三个维度去养好脾胃。身体养好了，适合你的答案自然会浮现。

**今心为念 内返收坎**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/95fyjW3ctx-XgrhrDdm--g  
老道长解字，我猜多数人看着是晕的。确实，不曾经过长时间的修行，缺乏对道家的深入了解，老道长即便说了天大的秘密，我们也不能领悟。记得老道长在北京白云观讲座，“天字第一号”（道门全国考试第一名）孟爷开场时专门强调：“道学，不是研究出来的，一研究就错。因为，道学是实修出来的......”不过，聚沙成塔，念念不忘，没准有一天就一窍百通了呢？道爷当年不就是因为“朙”、“體”两个字的开悟，一下子融会贯通了吗？
