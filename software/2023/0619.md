**前端这个岗位发展的再思考**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/hYFV9Ph7D_m57hFarIo6fQ  
十几年的时间里前端技术以飞快的速度发展着，各种网红和框架你方唱罢我登场，前端从一个婴幼儿快速长大为一个青壮年。在这个过程中，大家有意无意之间忽视了一个点，前端的完整名称叫前端工程师，它的主语是工程师。就像一个人，小时候可以各种折腾各种玩各种学，一群人集中在一起快乐成长，这个时候，叫 boy，现在该长大了，该叫 man 了，该吃点生活的苦了。

**AI: First New UI Paradigm in 60 Years**  
https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ai-paradigm/  
https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36394569  
Summary: AI is introducing the third user-interface paradigm in computing history, shifting to a new interaction mechanism where users tell the computer what they want, not how to do it — thus reversing the locus of control. Releated: [Revolutionizing User Interfaces: The Impact of AI](https://spin.atomicobject.com/2023/06/15/ai-interfaces/).  

**Finish your projects**  
https://github.com/readme/guides/finish-your-projects  
In this Guide, you will learn:  
- How finishing a project is different from solving the problem you set out to solve.  
- What role fear might play in limiting you from reaching your potential.  
- What you stand to gain by seeing a project through to the end.  

**Fresh 1.2 – welcoming a full-time maintainer, sharing state between islands, limited npm support, and more**  
https://deno.com/blog/fresh-1.2  
The future of Fresh looks brighter than ever. In the coming months, you can expect significant improvements to usability, features, performance, and project maintenance. We’re still working out the exact roadmap for our plans going forward, which we’ll share once it’s ready.

**Migrating Netflix to GraphQL Safely**  
https://netflixtechblog.com/migrating-netflix-to-graphql-safely-8e1e4d4f1e72  
Doing this safely for 100s of millions of customers without disruption is exceptionally challenging, especially considering the many dimensions of change involved. This blog post will share broadly-applicable techniques (beyond GraphQL) we used to perform this migration. The three strategies we will discuss today are AB Testing, Replay Testing, and Sticky Canaries.

**Models and structured reasoning**  
https://glazkov.com/2023/06/13/models-and-structured-reasoning/  
To make my “reasoning structure” concept a bit more clear, I tried to conjure one up relying on the problem understanding framework that I’ve created a while back. This is just one rough sketch, but it should give you some idea of what the heck I am talking about.

**Modern CSS For Dynamic Component-Based Architecture**  
https://moderncss.dev/modern-css-for-dynamic-component-based-architecture/  
Today, we will explore modern project architecture, emphasizing theming, responsive layouts, and component design. We'll learn about features to improve code organization and dig into layout techniques such as grid and container queries. Finally, we'll review real-world examples of context-aware components that use cutting-edge CSS techniques. You're sure to be inspired to expand your CSS skills and ready to create scalable, future-friendly web projects.

**Meet Codux: The React Visual Editor That Improves Developer Experience**  
https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2023/06/codux-react-visual-editor-improves-developer-experience/  
Codux is a new visual IDE brought to you by the fine folks over at Wix. It’s got a lot of low-code features that level the playing field for app development but is really designed for React developers. How so, you ask? That’s what we’re going to explore in this article.

**Designing a Scalable Backend in Node.js**  
https://blog.appsignal.com/2023/06/07/designing-a-scalable-backend-in-nodejs.html  
This article will explore three scaling challenges in a fictional Node.js backend system, written as user stories. While this system is fictional, these issues closely mirror ones I have seen in my career, and they may also be familiar to you. We’ll discuss useful tools for diagnosing the root causes of scaling issues, as well as techniques for alleviating bottlenecks and eliminating points of failure.

**The Next Generation of Serverless is Happening**  
https://www.fermyon.com/blog/next-generation-of-serverless-is-happening  
Let’s start from the beginning (a very good place to start). Because back before AWS, there were a couple of technologies that set the course for serverless.

**Native JSON Output From GPT-4**  
https://yonom.substack.com/p/native-json-output-from-gpt-4  
When integrating LLMs in your products, you often want to generate structured data, like JSONs. With the help of function calling (released June 13th 2023), this process has become much simpler! In this post I will explore the new API.

**Rewriting the Ruby parser**  
https://railsatscale.com//2023-06-12-rewriting-the-ruby-parser/  
At Shopify, we have spent the last year writing a new Ruby parser, which we’ve called YARP (Yet Another Ruby Parser). As of the date of this post, YARP can parse a semantically equivalent syntax tree to Ruby 3.3 on every Ruby file in Shopify’s main codebase, GitHub’s main codebase, CRuby, and the 100 most popular gems downloaded from rubygems.org. We recently got approval to merge this work into CRuby, and are very excited to share our work with the community. This post will take you through the motivations behind this work, the way it was developed, and the path forward.

**Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2023**  
https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2023/  
This year, we went deep into AI/ML to capture how developers are thinking about it and using it in their workflows. Stack Overflow is investing heavily in enhancing the developer experience across our products, using AI and other technology, to get people to solutions faster. Stack Overflow Labs is where we're sharing all we're doing - check it out for a deep dive on AI/ML insights as well as see what we're experimenting with so far.

**Killing Community**  
https://www.marginalia.nu/log/82_killing_community/  
This is a theory that’s previously been stated in log/39-normie-hypothesis.gmi, but I think it’s worth expanding on as it’s become very relevant with the recent Reddit shit-show actualizing just how bad that website has gotten along with social media in general. Releated: [Here’s the note Reddit sent to moderators threatening them if they don’t reopen](https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/16/23763538/reddit-blackout-api-protest-mod-replacement-threat)

**What I Learned From Two Years of Teaching High School CS**  
https://blog.charliemeyer.co/what-i-learned-from-two-years-of-teaching-high-school-cs/  
I’m posting this on my last day teaching high school computer science. In the past two years, I’ve worked with over 200 students and for many, my class was their first experience coding. I did not succeed in getting 100% of my students interested in programming. (Not even close) By the end of my class, many were determined to never try coding again in their lives.

**The emoji of the future**  
https://www.aiweirdness.com/the-emoji-of-the-future/  
Some of the recent image-generating models have this thing where they can fill in the blank parts of images. It's handy when you want to show them exactly how to give you more of the same. Like these animal emoji. See if you can tell which ones I gave DALL-E2 as examples, and which ones it added.

**不喜欢编程语言的PHP之父——Rasmus Lerdorf**

过去，我不喜欢编程，现在还是不咋喜欢。但是我喜欢以解决问题为中心，这点将永远不会改变。

**行走世间，孔子的“绝技”**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/2Lm8qMU25jMvSzRRASrTAw  
一切不是心甘情愿的东西，都注定不能长久，也注定不能应用自如，更不能被别人的真心所感应到。人这是先糊弄于己，进而糊弄于外。你糊弄人，人就糊弄你；你糊弄事，事就糊弄你。天道如是。发自于真心的东西，就叫德性；只有德性，能发自于真心。譬如仁义礼智信，譬如温良恭俭让。
