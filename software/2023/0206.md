**Is software getting worse?**  
https://stackoverflow.blog/2023/01/30/is-software-getting-worse/  
With all the advancements in software development, apps could be much better. Why aren't they?

**The Future (and the Past) of the Web is Server Side Rendering**  
https://deno.com/blog/the-future-and-past-is-server-side-rendering  
What started out fun for frontend developers, building shit-hot sites with all the bells and whistles, has kinda turned into not fun. We're now fighting different browsers to support, slow networks to ship code over, and intermittent, mobile connections. Supporting all these permutations is a giant headache. How do we square this circle? By heading back to the server (Swiss basement not required). Releated: [Future Frontend - A new conference to reimagine the future of the frontend - Interview with Juho Vepsäläinen](https://survivejs.com/blog/future-frontend-interview/).

**Interop 2023: continuing to improve the web for developers**  
https://web.dev/interop-2023/  
Again in 2023, all major browser vendors, and other stakeholders, work together to solve the top browsers compatibility issues.

**How to Write a Code Editor from Scratch in 4 Months**  
https://edita.vercel.app/blog/approach/  
Over the past 21 months I’ve written a code editor from the ground up, including: a fast (~120fps) canvas-based editor component; multi-language syntax highlighting with Tree-sitter; snippets; a file browser; find-and-replace with regex and JavaScript expression support; and two completely new features: AST mode and CodePatterns. In this post I will describe the development approach I’ve followed, which has allowed me to go from zero to a usable editor in 4 months; to daily-drivability in 7 months; and continues to make working on it easy and rewarding as it matures.

**2022, a new scientific adventure: machine learning for health and social sciences**  
https://gael-varoquaux.info/science/2022-a-new-scientific-adventure-machine-learning-for-health-and-social-sciences.html  
A retrospective on last year (2022): I embarked on a new scientific adventure, assembling a team focused on developing machine learning for health and social science. The team has existed for almost a year, and the vision is nice shaping up. Let me share with you illustrations of where we are at. This is extracted from our yearly report which will be public later, but I have sometimes edited it a bit to add personal context.

**The “Build Your Own Redis” Book is Completed**  
https://build-your-own.org/blog/20230127_byor/  
Needless to say, the Redis project is quite a success. It’s an important component in backend applications. Redis could be considered one of the building blocks of modern computing. There are not many projects that fit the such role and stood the test of time. Here are some examples that meet my criteria of the “building block”: NGINX, SQLite, PostgreSQL, Kafka, Linux kernel, etc.

**大厂裁员轰轰烈烈，哪个技术岗位可以独善其身？**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/rtx4UWkuvrKf7gtd6pFr-A  
即使公司经营状况不好，技术线如果要做裁员，也非常不建议要裁本来就人数很少的 DBA。而且作为一个专家型岗位，优秀的 DBA 往往又会呈现出「善战者无赫赫之功」的感觉。现在公司不再做梦去追逐上限，都切换到生存模式，保证下限。而在所有的技术岗位里，DBA 就是那个下限的兜底，保障着公司的最核心资产，业务数据的生命线。对于一个中大型研发组织，如果没有 DBA，我可能无法想象一旦出现严重的线上数据库故障，他们将该如何应对。但我知道的是，当下一次再出现故障的时候，被追责的工程 VP 或是 CTO 不再会是那同一个人了。

**SQLite的文艺复兴**  
https://www.bmpi.dev/dev/renaissance-sqlite/  
QLite为什么能在如此多领域有创新的项目出现？一方面得益于SQLite高质量的代码，近亿行的测试代码保证了其坚若磐石的可靠性，另一方面又得益其简单的架构，总共的实现源码也才15万行。对比其他数据库如MySQL有超过四百万行的源码，Oracle有超过上千万行的源码，就连Postgres的源码也超过百万行了。正如你很难让大象跳舞一样，个人开发者也很难单打独斗去在这种规模的代码上做创新。而SQLite的架构简单，代码量少，使得它成为了一个非常好的实验平台，让开发者可以在SQLite的基础上做出各种各样的创新。另附：[The Untold Story of SQLite (2021)](https://corecursive.com/066-sqlite-with-richard-hipp/)。

**Code：美团代码托管平台的演进与实践**  
https://tech.meituan.com/2023/02/02/code-the-evolution-and-practice-of-meituan-code-repositories-platform.html  
Code是美团自研的代码托管平台，其中包括了代码版本管理、分支管理及代码评审等功能，协同众多研发流程工具平台，支撑内部所有工程师的日常研发工作。经过近3年的建设，目前Code托管了数以万计的仓库，日常处理千万级的Git相关请求，稳定支撑着美团研发流程规范的持续落地。本文主要介绍美团在建设代码托管平台过程中面临的一些挑战和实践经验。

**Asynchronous computing at Meta: Overview and learnings**  
https://engineering.fb.com/2023/01/31/production-engineering/meta-asynchronous-computing/  
At Meta, we have built a platform for serverless asynchronous computing that is provided as a service for other engineering teams. They register asynchronous functions on the platform and then submit workloads for execution via our SDK. The platform executes these workloads in the background on a large fleet of workers and provides additional capabilities such as load balancing, rate limiting, quota management, downstream protection and many others. We refer to this infrastructure internally as “Async tier.” 

**I’m Now a Full-Time Professional Open Source Maintainer**  
https://words.filippo.io/full-time-maintainer/  
Last May I left my job on the Go team at Google to experiment with more sustainable paths for open-source maintainers. I held on to my various maintainer hats (Go cryptography, transparency tooling, age, mkcert, yubikey-agent…), iterated on the model since September, and I’m happy to report that I am now a full-time independent open-source maintainer. That means I spend most of my time on maintenance, and I offer retainers to companies that benefit from my work and from access to my planning and my expertise. 

**Releasing code in large corporations is slow – and there is a good reason for it**  
https://christianheilmann.com/2023/01/31/releasing-code-in-large-corporations-is-slow-and-there-is-a-good-reason-for-it/  
One of the things I always loved about the web is its immediacy. You write a piece of code, publish it somewhere and people can access it. No compilation step, no packaging and distribution, no listing on marketplaces or app stores – just a push of the button. This gives people a wrong impression that this way of working should scale to products and large companies as well.

**Why We Ship the Most Code on Friday**  
https://blog.railway.app/p/ship-on-friday  
Isn’t Shipping on Friday Bad? 🐍 The theory goes that if you ship code on Friday you’ll inevitably be working Saturday to fix what you broke. This makes logical sense; software is messy and mistakes are unavoidable. But no, shipping code on Fridayisn’t bad. At least, it doesn’t have to be.

**为什么微信要这么干？**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/AV2eSnq5Yk84y25oh8I1pA  
如果你是微信的产品经理，面对用户的质疑时会如何回复？昨天，我在微信的一个灰度群里看到一个讨论挺有意思的，或许可以作为一个思考题跟你们聊聊。有一个公众号运营者提了一个问题，说微信为什么不在文章开头加一个「关注」按钮，这样既方便用户关注，也避免了一些文章内容之外的牛牛皮癣。比如，有不少公众号运营者都会在文章开头加上这样的描述来引导读者关注。

**把期望刻进你的名字**

软件开发里的两大难题之一就是起名，产品，模块，函数，变量，程序员整天在面对起名的问题，要起一个信，达，雅的名字确实挺难的。名字包含了起名者对被起名对象的认知和期望，不止软件开发，许多地方都面临起名的难题。

**春天，你好！**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/BN3tUKXX7K-BIm7dU8qE3Q  
三年之前，春天似乎也没什么分别，一样的燕飞来，雨落下。但是总觉得多出了点什么情绪，分明已是不同的心境。我想，如果用两个字描述的话应该是“珍惜”。珍惜在春天里自由的呼吸，珍惜身边人依然平安健康，珍惜当下，不念未来。珍惜当下最好的方式便是与自然相律动，介绍几种在春天里比较适合做的事情，做好了既能安稳现在，也能播种未来。
