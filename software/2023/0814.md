**Things you forgot (or never knew) because of React**  
https://joshcollinsworth.com/blog/antiquated-react  
My sense is: we’re beginning to near another leap. I don’t know what it will be, or why. But I think we’re starting to feel all the problems React actually doesn’t solve for us, like we felt with jQuery back in those days. And I think eventually, it will be clear that it’s time to advance. What will that new thing be? I don’t know. Maybe it’ll just be the web platform. Maybe we won’t even need frameworks. Maybe it’ll be a framework above; maybe it’ll be something we haven’t even seen yet. Releated:

**Google: Introducing Project IDX, An Experiment to Improve Full-stack, Multiplatform App Development**  https://developers.googleblog.com/2023/08/introducing-project-idx-experiment-to-improve-full-stack-multiplatform-app-development.html  
While Google’s been working on making multiplatform app development easier for years – from Angular and Flutter to Google Cloud and Firebase – it feels like there’s even more we can do to make the entire multiplatform app development workflow faster and more frictionless. So several months ago, a few of us got together and started experimenting. And today, we’re excited to share a very early look at our experiment, which we’re calling Project IDX.

**A Blog Post With Every HTML Element**  
https://www.patrickweaver.net/blog/a-blog-post-with-every-html-element/  
A goal of the post, was to avoid delaying other future posts with CSS updates on a previously unused element, but in reality it took a year and a half to make all the updates for just this post! I am using the MDN Web Docs list of HTML elements as a reference which has more than 100 tags divided into a few categories, which I will also use in this post. 

**基于 RPC 和 TypeScript 的 BFF 设计与实践**  
https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/649521396  
在这篇文章中，我们将介绍一种基于 RPC 和 TypeScript 的 BFF 设计与实践。我们称之为 RPC-BFF，它利用前后端都采用同一语言（TypeScript）的优势，实现了其它 BFF 技术方案所不具备的多项功能，可以显著提升前后端数据交互的性能、效率以及类型安全。

**Do Machine Learning Models Memorize or Generalize?**  
https://pair.withgoogle.com/explorables/grokking/  
In this article we’ll examine the training dynamics of a tiny model and reverse engineer the solution it finds – and in the process provide an illustration of the exciting emerging field of mechanistic interpretability [9, 10]. While it isn’t yet clear how to apply these techniques to today’s largest models, starting small makes it easier to develop intuitions as we progress towards answering these critical questions about large language models.

**A compilation of outstanding testing articles (with JavaScript)**  
https://practica.dev/blog/a-compilation-of-outstanding-testing-articles-with-javaScript/  
As a testing consultant, I read tons of testing articles throughout the years. The majority is nice-to-read, casual pieces of content which not always worth your precious time. Once in a while, not very often, I landed on an article that was shockingly good and could genuinely improve your test writing skills. I've cherry-picked these outstanding articles for you, and added my abstract nearby. Half of these articles are related directly to JavaScript/Node.js, the second half covers ubiquitous testing concepts that are applicable in every language.

**Ancient lore: Lehman’s laws of software evolution**  
https://microservices.io//post/architecture/2023/08/06/lehmans-laws-of-software-evolution.html  
I recently came across another important body of work: Lehman’s laws of software evolution These laws, which were first published in 1974, describe the forces (a.k.a concerns) that influence evolution of an application. Some laws drive the evolution of an application while others impede it. Let’s first look at the kind of applications that Lehman’s laws apply to. After that I’ll describe the laws themselves.

**Your Computer Should Say What You Tell It To Say**

Google is adding code to Chrome that will send tamper-proof information about your operating system and other software, and share it with websites. Google says this will reduce ad fraud. In practice, it reduces your control over your own computer, and is likely to mean that some websites will block access for everyone who's not using an "approved" operating system and browser.

**中医正在火遍美军？美国防部发布22页的“针灸指南”**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/HiN0lhvcSMXaXqTMETsp0Q  
现在，美军三分之二的军队医院和其他治疗中心提供针灸服务。联邦科学研究机构国家补充和综合健康中心的艾米琳·爱德华兹 (Emmeline Edwards) 说，军方对针灸等替代方案持开放态度是“因为那里的需求如此之大”，“也许有些方法是在没有强有力的询证基础情况下使用的，但他们还是愿意尝试它，看看它是否有效。”随着研究的继续，针灸在美国的保险范围也在不断扩大。

**爹妈未富先老，儿女未富先娇**

美国第二任总统约翰·亚当斯说的，我们必须去钻研政治和军事，这样我们的孩子们就获得自由去钻研工业和商业。我们的孩子们必须去钻研工业和商业，这样他们的孩子就可能去钻研艺术和文学。其实我们的爷爷辈，父辈，再到我们的下一代，不就是这样吗。但亚当斯还没把话说完，如果我们的孩子去搞艺术，那其他族群的孩子可能正在搞军事和工业，而我们的孩子会输掉那些竞争，然后我们的孩子的孩子就不得不重新去搞军事和政治了。这是一个循环。饿时代培养出硬汉，硬汉创造出饱时代，饱时代圈养出小鲜肉，小鲜肉创造饿时代。这是历史的剧本

**一切“反常”，皆是灾难前兆**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/hqpHAISj1ZouAdTQGOmvnQ  
所谓反常，即是个“反平常”。所谓平常，就是个“平息反常”。儒家所以云“素位而行”，要安守本分。道家所以言“道法自然”，要质朴真实。禅宗所以有“平常心是道”的直指，要观照当下。这才是安乐之道。古德教诲，从这个视角再去观照，才能在敬畏中，得一分真明白。天地世间之最可贵者：平平淡淡，细水长流。在这其中，去寻求与涵养内在的富足。妄动贪求，皆是不知惜福。
