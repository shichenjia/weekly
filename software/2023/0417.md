https://slack.engineering/real-time-messaging/  
In this blog post we’ll describe the architecture that we use to send real-time messages at this scale. We’ll take a closer look at the services that send the chat messages and various events to these online users in real time. Our core services are written in Java: They are Channel Servers, Gateway Servers, Admin Servers, and Presence Servers.

My name is Lars Wirzenius, and I was there when Linux started. Linux is now a global success, but its beginnings were rather more humble. These are my memories of the earliest days of Linux, its creation, and the start of its path to where it is today.

**The end of a myth: Distributed transactions can scale**  
http://muratbuffalo.blogspot.com/2023/04/the-end-of-myth-distributed.html  
Remote direct memory access (RDMA) allows bypassing the CPU when transferring data from one machine to another. This helps relieve a major factor in scalability of distributed transactions: the CPU overhead of the TCP/IP stack. With so many messages to process, CPU may spend most of the time serializing/deserializing network messages, leaving little room for the actual work. We had seen this phenomena first hand when we were researching the performance bottlenecks of Paxos protocols.

**The Free Software Foundation is dying**  
https://drewdevault.com/2023/04/11/2023-04-11-The-FSF-is-dying.html  
Today, almost 40 years on, the FSF is dying. Their achievements are unmistakable: we must offer them our gratitude and admiration for decades of accomplishments in establishing and advancing our cause. The principles of software freedom are more important than ever, and the products of these institutions remain necessary and useful – the GPL license family, GCC, GNU coreutils, and so on. Nevertheless, the organizations behind this work are floundering. Releated: [Open source is fueling the future of nuclear physics](https://github.com/readme/featured/nuclear-fusion-open-source).

**李慈雄：教育现状的反思**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/3ZkOG6md6RlsK8JMm6T8eA  
现在社会经济发展这么迅速，我们的国力也是举足轻重，但我们教育的根本问题却还没有解决。问题出在哪里？我们的挑战在哪里？未来的出路又在哪里？我想我们在座的各位，不管是身为父母，还是从事教育的老师，或是身为政府官员的朋友，凡是对我们民族文化有一份感情的人，应该去深思。另附：[培养一个拥有幸福感的孩子是最大的成功](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/EjKuegL_AbgYst5nzONd2A)。

**真正自由的灵魂，一般都知“天命”而“修”天命**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/XSbQXUu8O-T0KqwHn870yg  
人有没有自由的可能？人的命运有没有自己可以创造的部分？这里包含着人类命运，及人类自由意志的问题；同时，人类是否参与自身命运的创造？这三个问题隐藏在这两句话的底下，也是人类共有的问题。《中庸》里的“修道之谓教”，就是人面对这种命定的命运和被规范的生命，透过自觉的过程可加以调整。

**我们为什么要办中医书院**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/dSuedxyaF_-B6xdg7tCtkA  
医最珍贵的地方就是对生命的认识，对生命全方位的认识，也就是探讨生命究竟是什么？生命是怎么来的（哲学的命题）？生命是不是我们看到的有形的这种状态？中医对这些是有认识的。那么基于这样一种认识，我们从去年便确定了三和书院的教育是终身制的教育，因为生命的成长是从小到大，就像今天我们袁（钟）老师讲的生老病死，整个生命的这个全过程。

**迷茫时，不妨读一读路遥**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/OPKeara9v8oYfNynb_OpLA  
最近，电视剧《人生之路》在央视一套热播。这部剧部分取材于路遥的中篇小说《人生》。路遥一直是《夜读》读者最喜爱的作家之一。《人生》也是激励万千读者的文学经典，甚至有人说：“每个看《人生》的人，看的都是自己的人生。”今天，《夜读》为你整理了《人生》这本书里的20句话，句句朴实，读来却不由得心里一震。
