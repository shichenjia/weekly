**The Tao of Go**  
https://bitfieldconsulting.com/golang/tao-of-go  
So what is the Tao of Go? If we were to approach software development in Go in a sensitive, intelligent way, following the natural contours of the language and the problem rather than trying to bulldoze them out of the way, what would that look like? Let’s try to establish a few general principles. Releated:

**Is Critical Thinking the Most Important Skill for Software Engineers?**  
https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/critical-thinking/  
Critical thinking will only become more important as AI tools spread more. Without critical thinking, you let others do a lot of the thinking for you, and fail to spot problems with arguments. When encountered with jargon, you assume the other person must know better. Similarly, when coming across a "thought leader," you assume they must be right.

**基于Kotlin的纯原生跨端UI框架Kuikly——原生开发体验**  
https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/622485633  
作为终端同学，使用类 RN 和 Flutter 等跨端框架都需要学习新的开发语言、开发工具和开发生态，变成三端开发，并且跟原生相比性能上有缺憾（尤其在 Android 中低端机）。有没有可能，一个跨端 UI 框架是完全复用终端的开发语言、工具和生态，拥有原生性能和原生渲染，同时是 声明式（类似 Compose 和 SwiftUI）和轻量的（0.3m 安装包）。这就是 Kuikly，腾讯内部推出的新一代跨端 UI 框架，并且已经在业务深度落地。

**The Acronyms of Rendering on the Web**  
https://www.netlify.com/blog/the-acronyms-of-rendering/  
There are so many acronyms and initialisms in web development, it’s difficult to keep up. Does SSR affect my CWV? How many HTTP methods does it take to make a REST API? Does a SPA use CSR? Help, I need CPR! Don’t worry, I’m here for you. Let’s break down the acronyms and initialisms of rendering on the web so you can get some much needed R&R.

**Spinning Diagrams with CSS**  
https://x.st/spinning-diagrams-with-css/  
I wrote a little math thing last year, which featured equations like this. Several people expressed surprise that the spinning diagrams don’t use any JavaScript or animated image formats, just HTML and CSS. So I thought I’d explain how they work before I forget.

**It's time to learn oklch color**  
https://keithjgrant.com/posts/2023/04/its-time-to-learn-oklch-color/  
If you’re anything like me, looking at all the things happening in CSS lately involving color, you’re probably a bit overwhelmed. For a long time, HSL was promoted as the human readable alternative to hex or RGB. For about a decade, HSL has been the best option for working comfortably with color on the web. But now, somewhat suddenly, we’ve got several new options thrown into the mix: hwb(), lab(), lch(), oklab(), and oklch(). There’s also color() which sort of fits into the same category and kind of doesn’t.

**Offline Is Just Online With Extreme Latency**  
https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2023/offline-is-online-with-extreme-latency/  
The generalized principle underlying in this idea, as Peter points out, is that when you shift the way you think about building things you open new doors to building different things. So, even if you don’t like the idea of data synchronization over API transactions, it’s at least worth entertaining and imagining what’s possible in a paradigm that’s different than what you’re used to.

In 2020 I wondered if I could run my blog on solar power, being inspired by Low-tech Magazine, doing the same thing (but better)1. The answer was 'yes', but only through spring and summer.

In this post we're going to focus on the ways that a single load balancer might distribute HTTP requests to a set of servers. We'll start from the bottom and work our way up to modern load balancing algorithms.

**《论语》里的存亡绝续**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/T6KBI3o4f31RYswE5aMmKg  
《论语》之所以值得每一个热爱华夏文化，追求进步成功的中国人去反复品读的原因，就在于孔子实事求是，秉持君子耻其言而过其行的中正态度。关于生死，世人往往迷茫于所谓儒家杀生成仁，文死谏武死战的刻板印象，抑或是觉得这些都是死道死贫道的骗人话术，这都是对于孔子传述的儒家理论不求甚解或者是层次不清导致的。
