**Writing Javascript without a build system**  
https://jvns.ca/blog/2023/02/16/writing-javascript-without-a-build-system/  
I want to talk about what’s appealing to me about build systems, why I (usually) still don’t use them, and why I find it frustrating that some frontend Javascript libraries require that you use a build system. I’m writing this because most of the writing I see about JS assumes that you’re using a build system, and it can be hard to navigate for folks like me 

**<3 Deno**  
https://matklad.github.io/2023/02/12/a-love-letter-to-deno.html  
Deno is a relatively new JavaScript runtime. I find quite interesting and aesthetically appealing, in-line with the recent trend to rein in the worse-is-better law of software evolution. This post explains why. Related:

**Announcing Sandpack 2.0 and a Node.js runtime for any browser**  
https://codesandbox.io/blog/announcing-sandpack-2  
We are beyond excited to introduce Sandpack 2.0, which brings a Node.js runtime that runs in every browser. Releated: [Stackbiz - WebContainer API is here](https://blog.stackblitz.com/posts/webcontainer-api-is-here/).

**React.js: The Documentary**  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pDqJVdNa44  
https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/606298951  
React is easily one of the single most popular libraries in use today. Given that it was made within a juggernaut like Facebook, you might have assumed it was always destined for success. What if we told you that React’s first brush with the public sphere was anything but glamorous? React.js: The Documentary brings you the full story behind the early days of React, focusing on the dedicated group of developers who helped bring it to the world stage. This story is told by an all-star cast of developers like Tom Occhino, Christopher Chedeau, Pete Hunt, Sebastian Markbåge, Dan Abramov, and many more. Releated:

**The modern web’s underrated powerhouse**  
https://github.com/readme/featured/css-future  
Though it’s not a full-fledged programming language like JavaScript, CSS is incredibly powerful. Take a look at designer, front-end developer, and artist Lynn Fisher’s website A Single Div, where she draws complex illustrations using only CSS, or her old portfolio site that changes wildly as you resize it, for examples of just how much you can do with CSS. Once a fairly limited and restrictive approach to styling pages, CSS has become a highly adaptive system for designing web applications, thanks to the dedicated community around it.

**Core-JS chief complains open source is broken, no one will pay for it**  
https://www.theregister.com/2023/02/15/corejs_russia_open_source  
https://github.com/zloirock/core-js/blob/master/docs/2023-02-14-so-whats-next.md  
Denis Pushkarev, maintainer of the core-js library used by millions of websites, says he's ready to give up open source development because so few people pay for the software upon which they depend.

**Maybe people do care about performance and reliability**

But they are victims of complex societal factors that are beyond their control

**Sometimes Optimization Is About More Than Code**  
https://www.simplethread.com/sometimes-optimization-is-about-more-than-code/  
Sometimes when you’re running into an optimization problem, you need to step back and ask yourself if the current solution is optimal for the user. There are certainly valid situations where loading a ton of data and displaying it to the user is ideal. But often if you’re running into performance issues because you’re showing too much data, you’ve passed the point where the user can reason about what you’re showing them. At that point it can be time to step back, think about what your user needs, and redirect your efforts.

**The Wallpapering Principle**  
https://glazkov.com/2023/02/14/the-wallpapering-principle/  
This principle builds on the layering principle, and deals with a common decision point that most software developers reach many times in the course of their work.

**Are No-Code Tools A Good Choice For Developers?**  
https://marmelab.com/blog/2023/02/17/build-a-react-admin-like-interface-in-no-code.html  
To conclude, I think it requires the knowledge of a developer to tweak no-code tools such as ReTool enough to build moderately complex apps. And developers are more productive with low-code tools... So I wouldn't recommend it, except for simple dashboards.

**Coding 102: Writing code other people can read**

That bootcamp may have taught you to write code that works. But the next level is to write code that works with other people.

**Is "GraphQL Mesh" the Next Big Thing?**  
https://remotesynthesis.com/blog/is-graphql-mesh-the-next-big-thing/  
Let’s take two recent acquisitions, Netlify’s acquisition of Gatsby and IBM’s acquisition of StepZen. Both companies focus on allowing companies to bring together a variety of data sources under a single umbrella via GraphQL (Gatsby via their Valhalla product, which I argue was the real motivation behind the acquisition). Is this the beginning of a pattern? Does this mean that GraphQL mesh might be the next big thing? Let’s look at what GraphQL mesh is and I’ll share my thoughts on where it might be headed.

**SQLite the only database you will ever need in most cases**  
https://www.unixsheikh.com/articles/sqlite-the-only-database-you-will-ever-need-in-most-cases.html  
In contrast to many other database management systems, SQLite is not a client-server database engine, but you actually very rarely need that. If your application software runs on the same physical machine as the database, which is what most small to medium sized web applications does, then you probably only need SQLite.

**How should AI systems behave, and who should decide?**

We’re clarifying how ChatGPT’s behavior is shaped and our plans for improving that behavior, allowing more user customization, and getting more public input into our decision-making in these areas.

**Building a cross-platform runtime for AR**  
https://engineering.fb.com/2023/02/13/virtual-reality/meta-ar-augmented-reality-cross-platform-runtime/  
Meta’s augmented reality (AR) platform is one of the largest in the world, helping the billions of people on Meta’s apps experience AR every day and giving hundreds of thousands of creators a means to express themselves Meta’s AR tools are unique because they can be used on a wide variety of devices — from mixed reality headsets like Meta Quest Pro to phones, as well as lower-end devices that are much more prevalent in low-connectivity parts of the world.

**Hey, is that a CRM?**  
https://world.hey.com/dhh/hey-is-that-a-crm-eac61ae9  
When we first started work on HEY, we didn't mean to build a general-purpose email service at all. We were looking to create Highrise 2. The successor to our beloved small-team CRM system from 2007. We had several skunkworks attempts at that in the past. One was nicknamed Glenn Gary. Another was Chestnut. But it was realizing that email is the true center of the CRM that paved the path toward a real product. Only, we didn't build the CRM part before we released HEY!

**要想在技术上超越美国，需要全社会的正确观念**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/7m5g7hJQrzJJfLWbqtO7Fw  
如果你真心期待中国的科技腾飞，那就不能到处呼吁管一管，因为那就是目的与手段的背离，只会使技术进步的速度变慢，甚至回到落后的农业时代。作为一个普通消费者，更是完全没有反对技术进步的理由。正是技术进步，冲破了既得利益者的藩篱，绕开了重重管制，造福了消费者。想想网约车，想想腾讯的出现让你可以不再看电信局的脸色，想想支付宝的出现让你不再去银行，很明了的事实。一个既得利益者反对技术进步，虽然在观念和理解上是错误的，但至少心情是可以理解的。但是作为一个消费者，应当热情地拥抱创新，你又不是既得利益者，替人家瞎操心什么？

**回不去的“金三银四”**  
https://new.qq.com/rain/a/20230216A03VVK00  
随着经济环境变动与行业结构性调整走向深化，当前互联网行业对人才的招揽标准也发生了变化。  
其一，提高求职者应聘门槛。例如在起薪从20k降到15k的条件下，将工作经验从3年提高到5年，同时附加学历、资格证、项目经验等硬性要求。  
其二，对跨行业、具备复合型能力的人才越来越重视。曾有企业HR透露，在裁员盛行的2022年，他所在公司对于跨行业复合型人才依旧有强烈需求，甚至能给到30%-40%的薪酬涨幅。
关于后者的重要性，美团联合创始人王慧文2020年在清华大学演讲中曾分享过一个故事。  
王慧文和王兴起初做校内网时，雇不起工程师和产品经理，只能逼着自己两头都沾着学。结果他发现，“半吊子工程师”和“半吊子产品经理”这两个角色合二为一后，反而提升了工作效率，比纯粹专业技术团队做出的产品更好。王慧文由此提出，社会最稀缺的是“π型人才”：当一个人在两个领域都有认知的时候，他产生的威力不只是1+1，而是1后面加个0。
