Nonetheless, I think it’s useful to share what I can about my experience in the hope that it might encourage others to seriously consider this role, especially those from backgrounds, identities, and genders poorly represented in the VP of Engineering ranks today. VPs of Engineering often have a lot of influence over both company culture and policy, and the decisions our companies make ripple outside of the companies themselves. The whole tech industry would benefit from more perspectives in this role.

**TypeScript and the dawn of gradual types**  
https://github.com/readme/featured/typescript-gradual-types  
The story of TypeScript, and the recent paradigm shift of the past decade, is less about “either or” and more about getting the best of both worlds—with gradual typing. In fact, while Python is still dynamic, it too has made the move toward gradual typing, as have several other languages of its ilk.

**Wireshark Is 25: The email that started it all and the lessons learned along the way**  
https://blog.wireshark.org/2023/07/wireshark-is-25/  
25 years ago when I sent that email, I never thought I would be blogging about the project today! If you’ve ever thought about starting an open source project, don’t hesitate to do so. Supporting and managing Wireshark has given me a wonderful career, and opportunities to meet and work with brilliant, inspiring people. If I had to distill everything I’ve learned down to a couple of pieces of advice, it would be this: The community has valuable insights to share. Let them do that.

**Static websites have a low barrier to entry**  
https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/web/StaticWebsitesLowEntryBarrier  
Yesterday I wrote about a criticism of the usual static versus dynamic website divide, where I noted a number of (what I see as) significant differences between static and dynamic websites in practice. But there is another important difference in practice, and that's the amount of expertise that's needed to create each of them. Specifically, static websites don't require much expertise to create. Given a suitable general web server environment, which is easy to provide, all you need to set up a static website is the ability to write HTML, or even an authoring and editing tool that will do it for you.

**傅盛回应与朱啸虎之争：纸上得来终觉浅，绝知此事要躬行**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/jZ5s-t0HXxcEPkLzlVb2Xg  
7月9日，我在混沌大学做了一次《ChatGPT时代如何创业》的演讲，演讲里提到了前两天在朋友圈的争论。但正像我在演讲中说的，抛开争论，了解ChatGPT的原理、大模型应用的价值对创业者来说更重要，希望在这个范式重构的百年一遇大机会面前，创业者能够有好奇心，肯行动，创造出真正的未来。

**7.22 高圣洁老师公益课直播预告丨如何能在早期发现脊柱问题**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/SEFxMXtb2VPjB8cKZvNilg  
从传统中医上看，脊柱内循行的督脉，可以督统全身阳气。常言道：“病从梁上起，寒从脚底生”。脊柱是人体的大梁，从古至今，脊柱对人体的健康起着至关重要的作用。但是在日常生活里，我们对脊柱的重视是远远不够的。从圣洁脊柱全息手法看，脊柱对人体的健康影响非常大，人体很多五脏六腑的问题以及感知功能的各种症状，都是由脊柱问题引起的。而诸多脊柱问题的发生、发展基本上在婴幼儿时期就已经形成。因此，我们要对脊柱与健康的关系有一个正确的认知，在青少年儿童成长过程中保驾护航的同时，帮助他们建立起良好的运动和生活习惯。

**老子所说的“上善若水”，究竟是啥意思？**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/pPThyk2tvoE2Nt4P5UN29A  
从思想角度去分析“上善若水”，可以得知老子想表达的含义，其实是高尚的品质就像流水一样。主要是因为水是生活中的寻常之物，无色、无味、无形并随形就势。无论是高山、低谷还是平原，都可以无怨无悔的依地势而生存。而作为一个拥有高尚品德的人，也应该像水一样，泽被万物不争名利。不应该因为山高而骄傲，也不应该因低谷而垂头丧气。做人、做事都要三思而后行，千万不要与世人一般见识。一定要培养以柔克刚的品性，只有这样才能做到虚怀若谷。
