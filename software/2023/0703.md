**The Cost Of JavaScript - 2023**  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKH3DLT4BKw  
As we build sites that are more heavily reliant on JavaScript, we sometimes pay for what we send down in ways that we can’t always easily see. In this talk, Addy explains how and why JavaScript is the most expensive resource your site uses today—especially on mobile and lower-end desktops.

**XML is the future**  
https://www.bitecode.dev/p/hype-cycles  
My first hype exposure was "use the Extensible Markup Language for everything". Learning from it allowed me to live through the front end stack explosion, the micro-service overdose and many, many more silly trends. It turns out Grandma was right. Eat vegetables, exercise, sleep well. And use the right tool for the right job. Well, she didn't say that last one. But she could have.

**How to Do Great Work**  
http://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html  
If you collected lists of techniques for doing great work in a lot of different fields, what would the intersection look like? I decided to find out by making it. Partly my goal was to create a guide that could be used by someone working in any field. But I was also curious about the shape of the intersection. And one thing this exercise shows is that it does have a definite shape; it's not just a point labelled "work hard." The following recipe assumes you're very ambitious.

**Is ORM still an anti-pattern?**  
https://github.com/getlago/lago/wiki/Is-ORM-still-an-%27anti-pattern%27%3F  
Ironically, this “ORMs aren’t that bad” defense piece was inspired by a negative ORM incident we experienced at Lago that caused us to question our reliance on Active Record, the Ruby on Rails ORM. And a really tempting title for this post would’ve been “ORMs kinda suck”. But after some meditation on the matter, we’ve reasoned that ORMs do not suck. They are simply an abstraction with a quintessential pro and con—they abstract away some visibility and occasionally incur some performance hits. That’s about it. Today, let’s dive into ORMs, their common criticisms, and the ones that are compelling in today’s context.

**Fast machines, slow machines**  
https://jmmv.dev/2023/06/fast-machines-slow-machines.html  
To open up, I’ll stand my ground: latency in modern computer interfaces, with modern OSes and modern applications, is terrible and getting worse. This applies to smartphones as well. At the same time, while UIs were much more responsible on computers of the past, those computers were also awful in many ways: new systems have changed our lives substantially. So, what gives?

**The Best Way to Acquire Knowledge from Readings**  
https://medium.com/heptabase/the-best-way-to-acquire-knowledge-from-readings-abf9357814d1  
In this article, I will share a real-world example of how I developed an effective method for acquiring, retaining, and applying knowledge using Heptabase, a tool my team and I created for learning and research. While this is not the only workflow for learning, it has worked extremely well for me, and I believe almost anyone can apply it to their learning.
