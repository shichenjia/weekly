Note, I'm not saying that JavaScript is weird, though it definitely is weird. But that's not the point of this blog post. Bear with me, instead of starting with how JavaScript ecosystem is weird, I'm going to start with why the JavaScript ecosystem is weird.

**The ongoing defence of frontend as a full-time job**  
https://christianheilmann.com/2023/05/09/the-ongoing-defence-of-frontend-as-a-full-time-job/  
A frontend developer isn’t a mediocre coder that only dabbles in “easy” languages like HTML, CSS and JavaScript. A frontend developer is someone who made a conscious choice to build interfaces for the unknown with a laser sharp focus on the end user’s experience. When people ask me why I am “just doing frontend”, I can happily explain these things and proclaim that I am proud to be a frontend engineer.

https://blog.brachiosoft.com/redis-en  
In the world of databases, Redis stands out as unique. Instead of the usual tables or documents that are the central focus of most databases, with Redis, you interact directly with low-level data structures such as linked lists and hash tables. This is all thanks to the innovative design of Redis creator Salvatore Sanfilippo, known online as antirez. A master in system programming, antirez prefers to think in terms of data structures like lists, hashes, and sets.

“究天人之际”，这是打通空间；“通古今之变”，则是打通时间。最后的“成一家之言”，即是作为能载道之主体的人，在究竟的时空定位中，而发现和找到了真正的他自己。于此时，此人乃可称为顶天立地、纵浪大化。一方面是无遮时空之背景与定位，一方面是自己和脚下，所谓天人合一，也就是如此。
