**Heads-Up Computing**  
https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2023/9/275704-heads-up-computing/fulltext  
Humans have come a long way in our co-evolution with tools (see Figure 1). Well-designed tools effectively expand our physical as well as mental capabilities,38 and the rise of computers in our recent history has opened up possibilities like never before. The graphical user interface (GUI) of the 1970s revolutionized desktop computing. Traditional computers with text-based, command-line interfaces evolved into an integrated everyday device: the personal computer (PC). Similarly, the mobile interaction paradigm introduced in the 1990s transformed how information can be accessed anytime and anywhere with a single handheld device. Never have we had so much computing power in the palm of our hands. Releated: []().

**An effective team communicates much like optimized code: with clarity, modularity, and a focus on simplicity**  
https://addyosmani.com/blog/team-communication/  
Software development is not just about writing code; it's a communal activity that demands effective communication. Clarity, modularity, and simplicity are attributes that don't just make for excellent code; they're also the cornerstone of a high-functioning team. As such, we should give communication the same level of scrutiny and practice as we do with our coding skills. After all, it takes a well-tuned team to build a well-tuned system.

**Reaching the Unix Philosophy's Logical Extreme with Webassembly**  
https://xeiaso.net/talks/unix-philosophy-logical-extreme-wasm  
WebAssembly. WebAssembly is a compiler target for an imaginary CPU that your phones, tablets, laptops, gaming towers and even watches can run. It's intended to be a level below JavaScript to allow us to ship code in maintainable languages. Today I'm gonna be talking about fun ways you can take advantage of WebAssembly, but first we need to talk about the other main part of this subject: Unix.

**Product Vision Starts with Problems, Not Solutions**

Developers need to avoid building the most elaborate solutions for the simplest problems

**Introducing Code Llama, a state-of-the-art large language model for coding**  
https://ai.meta.com/blog/code-llama-large-language-model-coding/  
Code Llama is state-of-the-art for publicly available LLMs on code tasks, and has the potential to make workflows faster and more efficient for current developers and lower the barrier to entry for people who are learning to code. Code Llama has the potential to be used as a productivity and educational tool to help programmers write more robust, well-documented software. Releated:

**低代码平台中的元编程(Meta Programming)**  
https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/652413095  
Nop平台的XLang语言是实现可逆计算原理的核心技术之一，为了落实可逆计算理论所提出的 App = Biz x-extends Generator<DSL> 这样一种面向DSL和差量编程的新的编程范式， XLang定义了一整套系统化的、覆盖应用系统开发方方面面的Generator方案。Lisp的宏仅仅是提供了生成Lisp AST的元编程机制，而XLang除了引入宏函数用于生成XLang AST之外，还提供了面向代码生成的Xpl模板语法， 生成的范围从局部的函数实现体，到单个模型文件，再到整个模块目录。  

**狠狠地研究了下 PerformanceObserver API**  
https://www.zhangxinxu.com/wordpress/2023/08/js-performanceobserver-api/  
MutationObserver可以用来观察DOM元素的变化，ResizeObserver可以用来观察DOM元素尺寸的变化，IntersectionObserver则可以观察元素和浏览器视窗相交的情况。而本文要介绍的 PerformanceObserver 则可以对页面的各项性能指标进行观察。

**To test or not to test, a technical perspective**

Determine what you need to test and what you can rule out.

**Use web components for what they’re good at**  
https://nolanlawson.com/2021/08/01/why-its-okay-for-web-components-to-use-frameworks/  
Should standalone web components be written in vanilla JavaScript? Or is it okay if they use (or even bundle) their own framework? With Vue 3 announcing built-in support for building web components, and with frameworks like Svelte and Lit having offered this functionality for some time, it seems like a good time to revisit the question.

**Slack’s Migration to a Cellular Architecture**  
https://slack.engineering/slacks-migration-to-a-cellular-architecture/  
In recent years, cellular architectures have become increasingly popular for large online services as a way to increase redundancy and limit the blast radius of site failures. In pursuit of these goals, we have migrated the most critical user-facing services at Slack from a monolithic to a cell-based architecture over the last 1.5 years. In this series of blog posts, we’ll discuss our reasons for embarking on this massive migration, illustrate the design of our cellular topology along with the engineering trade-offs we made along the way, and talk about our strategies for successfully shipping deep changes across many connected services.

**YAML is an okay enough configuration file format**  
https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/tech/YamlIsOkayEnough  
Ever since we set up Prometheus, I've had to deal with everyone's favorite configuration syntax to hate, YAML. Although YAML isn't universal in the Prometheus and Grafana ecosystem, it's pretty pervasive and many components and things you want to use are configured using it as the configuration syntax, so I've had to write and read plenty of it.

**Creating an integrated business and technology strategy**  
https://martinfowler.com/articles/creating-integrated-tech-strategy.html  
To make fruitful use of technology, we need to align our technology thinking with underlying business plans. A technology strategy can drive this alignment, providing it properly integrates business and technology. We have developed a conceptual framework to help us with this strategic thinking, based on recognizing common aspects of strategic initiatives, leading us to identify eleven prevalent strategic directions. For each direction we outline the key business questions that they raise, and the investigations that we need to do to explore the technology implications. We've found that this framework leads not just to more effective technology strategies, but allows technology to inform business thinking, developing new revenue streams.

**How Games Typically Get Built**  
https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/how-games-typically-get-built/  
To answer the question of how the video game development sector works, I turned to Tommy Thompson, director of AI and Games, who’s a veteran of game development and of teaching it. Tommy has built his own video games, consulted on a wide variety of game projects, and for a decade has taught game development at various universities. He also runs the highly popular AI and Games YouTube channel, where he delves into how AI makes for better games, and games make for better AI.

**If you want to address tech debt, quantify it first**

If you want the tech debt metaphor to really shine, get some numbers behind it.
