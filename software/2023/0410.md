**Learning React from two Angles in 2023**  
https://www.robinwieruch.de/learning-react/  
Learning React in 2023 is not the easiest endeavour. While we had lots of stability since the release of React Hooks in 2019, the tide is turning again. And it may be a more volatile shift than it has been with React Hooks. In this article, I want to compare the two angles on how to learn React in 2023: the library way and the framework way.

**一些关于开发的杂谈话题 - 测试**  
https://onevcat.com/2023/04/dev-talk-testing/  
在以前，我也写过一些关于测试的文章，不过更多的还是对某个特定框架的使用。我自己本身也在很长一段时间内保持了给包括框架和 app 写测试的习惯，并来回倒腾过不少不同风格的测试。在这篇短文里，我想对一些基本的问题和想法的变化进行解释。

**On Endings: Why & How We Retired Elm at Culture Amp**  
https://kevinyank.com/posts/on-endings-why-how-we-retired-elm-at-culture-amp/  
From time to time someone will ask, “Does Culture Amp still use Elm?” I’ll answer privately that no, we are no longer investing in Elm, and explain why. Invariably, they tell me my answer was super valuable, and that I should share it publicly. Until now, I haven’t.

**RFC: Angular Signals**  
https://github.com/angular/angular/discussions/49685  
We teased this in February, and now it's time to dig into the details: the Angular team requests your comments on our plan to adopt signals as a reactive primitive for Angular.

**XUL Layout is gone**  
https://crisal.io/words/2023/03/30/xul-layout-is-gone.html  
This was a rather big effort (first filed 9 years ago in bug 1033225), and I wanted to document some of the things that I learned during the process, some of the things and decisions that made it possible, and some of the things that I would’ve maybe done differently.

**Building GitHub with Ruby and Rails**  
https://github.blog/2023-04-06-building-github-with-ruby-and-rails/  
Since the beginning, GitHub.com has been a Ruby on Rails monolith. Today, the application is nearly two million lines of code and more than 1,000 engineers collaborate on it daily.… Releated: [Codeberg – Fast open source alternative to GitHub](https://codeberg.org/).

**Saying Goodbye to GitHub**  
https://ersei.net/en/blog/bye-bye-github  
https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35418760  
I've been using GitHub since I was eleven years old. To be fair, I didn't really understand git at the time, but I was able to fumble my way through it (barely). I do remember getting banned because eleven year old me decided to tell the internet my age on GitHub, and the ToS prohibited me from using the service until I was at least thirteen.

**How eBay Modernized the Most Important Page on Our Platform**  
https://tech.ebayinc.com/engineering/how-ebay-modernized-the-most-important-page-on-our-platform/  
eBay's core page — the View Item page — gets 250 million views per day. Here's how we took on the task of modernizing it.

**System design and the cost of architectural complexity**  
https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/79551  
Within this research setting, we found that differences in architectural complexity could account for 50% drops in productivity, three-fold increases in defect density, and order-of-magnitude increases in staff turnover. Using the techniques developed in this thesis, it should be possible for firms to estimate the financial cost of their complexity by assigning a monetary value to the decreased productivity, increased defect density, and increased turnover it causes. As a result, it should be possible for firms to more accurately estimate the potential dollar-value of refactoring efforts aimed at improving architecture.
