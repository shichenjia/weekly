**The End of Front-End Development**  
https://www.joshwcomeau.com/blog/the-end-of-frontend-development/  
Over the past few months, I've spoken with lots of early-career devs who are getting more and more anxious about AI. They've seen the increasingly-impressive demos from tools like GPT-4, and they worry that by the time they're fluent in HTML/CSS/JS, there won't be any jobs left for them. I couldn't disagree more. I don't think web developer jobs are going anywhere. And I'm getting pretty sick of the FUD? being spread online. So, in this blog post, I'm going to share my hypothesis for what will happen. Things are going to change, but not in the scary way people are saying.

**ChatGPT plugins**  
https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt-plugins  
We’ve implemented initial support for plugins in ChatGPT. Plugins are tools designed specifically for language models with safety as a core principle, and help ChatGPT access up-to-date information, run computations, or use third-party services. Releated:

**Building APIs for AI: An Interview with Zapier’s Bryan Helmig**  
https://www.ycombinator.com/blog/building-apis-for-ai-an-interview-with-zapiers-bryan-helmig/  
I got a chance to sit down with Bryan Helmig (@bryanhelmig), the CTO and founder of Zapier, to talk APIs, interoperability, and learn more about the company’s first-ever public API: Natural Language Actions (NLA). With this new API, they’re making it possible to plug integrations directly into your product, and it's optimized for LLMs.  

**Speeding up the JavaScript ecosystem - npm scripts**  
https://marvinh.dev/blog/speeding-up-javascript-ecosystem-part-4/  
npm scripts' are executed by JavaScript developers and CI systems all around the world all the time. Despite their high usage they are not particularly well optimized and add about 400ms of overhead. In this article we were able to bring that down to ~22ms.

**Do You Need a BFF? The Backend for Frontend Pattern**  
https://spin.atomicobject.com/2023/03/20/backend-for-frontend-pattern/  
Overall, the BFF pattern is a great tool for developers looking to create applications with complex connections between multiple clients and servers. Its scalability and flexibility allow for easier development and a better, tailored user experience.

**为什么 Serverless 不成功**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/dIWV9qzFuByaUxvi6p1q2w  
所以你看 Serverless 的渗透还是可以的，但是使用上基本还是被用在一些独立的小场景下。可以理解为基本作为应用的附件存在，而不是用来构建应用本身。那么，为什么大家不用 Serverless 来构建应用呢

**New React docs pretend SPAs don't exist anymore**  
https://wasp-lang.dev/blog/2023/03/17/new-react-docs-pretend-spas-dont-exist  
React just released their new docs at https://react.dev/. While it looks great and packs a lot of improvements, one section that caught the community’s attention is “Start a New React Project”. The strongly recommended way to start a new React project is to use a framework such as Next.js, while the traditional route of using bundlers like Vite or CRA is fairly strongly discouraged. But what about typical Single Page Apps (SPAs)? Dashboard-like tools that live behind the auth (and don’t need SEO at all), and for which React was originally designed, still very much exist.

**Migrating from ts-node to Bun**  
https://johnnyreilly.com/migrating-from-ts-node-to-bun  
I've wanted to take a look at some of the alternative JavaScript runtimes for a while. The thing that has held me back is npm compatibility. I want to be able to run my code in a runtime that isn't Node.js and still be able to use npm packages. I've been using ts-node for a long time now; it's what I reach for when I'm building any kind of console app. In this post I want to port a console app from ts-node to Bun and see how easy it is.

**Rich Harris Talks SvelteKit and What’s Next for Svelte**  
https://thenewstack.io/rich-harris-talks-sveltekit-and-whats-next-for-svelte/  
The creator of Svelte explains why it will get an overhaul this year and how SvelteKit can help deploy the frontend framework.

**When is :focus-visible visible?**  
https://bitsofco.de/when-is-focus-visible-visible/  
Before the :focus-visible CSS pseudo-class was introduced, there was no middle ground to this debate - you either sided with design or accessibility (hopefully the latter). But now, with :focus-visible, we can have focus styles that apply only when the browser / user agent determines that focus should be indicated on the element.

**Who builds it and who runs it? SRE team topologies**  
https://stackoverflow.blog/2023/03/20/who-builds-it-and-who-runs-it-sre-team-topologies/  
Ad-hoc SRE principles can get you on the right track, but if you want to sustain it long term, you'll need organizational structure.

**The history and legacy of Visual Basic**  
https://retool.com/blog/the-history-and-legacy-of-visual-basic/  
In Cooper's eyes, though, Windows had one major drawback. The shell—the graphical face of the operating system where you started programs and looked for files—was rudimentary, lacking overlapping windows and visual polish. Compared to Apple’s Macintosh GUI released almost two years earlier, it was clearly an aspect of the project into which Microsoft just hadn't put much effort. “It was a program called MSDOS.exe and it was very clear that somebody had written it in a weekend,” Cooper observes. “[Microsoft] might as well have had a neon sign saying, ‘Market Opportunity.’ And it just really intrigued me. So I started saying, ‘Okay, I'm going to build a shell.’”

**We're Living in a Scroll-and Swipe Doom Loop Culture**  
https://tedgioia.substack.com/p/were-living-in-a-scroll-and-swipe  
Culture started out on scrolls. And now it has returned to scrolling (and swiping) as the dominant forms of transmission. But, of course, those two types of scrolling could hardly be more different.

**身体对工作的重要性**  
https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/615656117  
我今年38岁了，以前做过架构师和CTO，现在已经沦落到回农村种田了，不再是领导，再也没有下属了，没有什么钱，除了这几年一个人在村里做了价值不明的框架，以及自己的代码编辑器，浏览器等，别的一无是处。我感觉我之所以混成今天的样子，主要还是因为一次过劳学习和一次拼命工作造成的，身上很不舒服，状态严重下滑，关键时刻退缩逃避，很多许下的目标没有完成，对人态度变差。如果你还年轻，还感觉良好，也要好好看看我的故事，因为你也会变老，你今后也可能会经历几次繁重的压力，一次次的把你的良好状态拖垮。

张一鸣可能在完全不经意间做了一件惊天动地的事情，他可能碰到了那个“百年未有之大变局”的机关。

**还有一场文化芯片的硬仗：用什么现代中国文化体系突入进异邦社会心灵？**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/p1RhkefatJKXJQycqcrvtw  
中国知识精英群体必须要意识到创造与建设出一个现代中国文化芯片体系既是无从回避的历史责任，也理应是现代中国知识分子当仁不让的新天下意识抱负，我们必须重新要有“铁肩担道义，妙手著文章”新中华文化时代的觉悟。只有有了一个现代中国文化芯片体系，中国现代文化内容对外输出时才会有系统性的内在逻辑支撑，突进时的才会有够锐利的锋芒，固守时也才能像山脉一样难以撼动，也才能真正去创造一个新自我并去改变全球世界。这需要很长很长时间，也需要立即开始。

**毛主席论孔子**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/4Q4yJq-f9rYF2mDqd-faEg  
学习孔子学说，培养了毛主席“古为今用”的爱好；学习资本主义理论，奠定了毛主席“洋为中用”的基础；研究马列主义，则坚定了毛主席的共产主义信念。总体看，毛主席对孔子既不是全部肯定，也不是全盘否定，而是集客观评论、批判、继承和发扬于一体。
