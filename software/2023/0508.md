**AI isn’t the app, it’s the UI**  
https://stackoverflow.blog/2023/05/01/ai-isnt-the-app-its-the-ui/  
A realistic understanding of generative AI can guide us to its ideal use case: not a decision-maker or unsupervised agent tucked away from the end user, but an interface between humans and machines.

**Angular v16 is here!**  
https://blog.angular.io/angular-v16-is-here-4d7a28ec680d  
Version 16 is the stepping stone for the future improvements coming to Angular’s reactivity and server-side rendering over the next year. We’ll be moving the Web forward by innovating in developer experience, performance, while enabling you to build for everyone!

User expectations of the web are now that you have this super-smooth no-reload experience. Unfortunately, it's an expectation that is usually delivered with single-page applications (SPAs) that rely on libraries and frameworks like React and Angular, which are very specialised tools that can be complicated to work with. A new approach is to put the ability to deliver this UX back into the hands of engineers that built websites before the SPA-craze, leveraging their existing toolsets and knowledge, and HTMX is the best example I've used so far.

We’re sharing our latest threat research and technical analysis into persistent malware campaigns targeting businesses across the internet, including threat indicators to help raise our industry’s collective defenses across the internet.

**Programming types and mindsets**  
https://world.hey.com/dhh/programming-types-and-mindsets-5b8490bc  
One of the longest running schisms in programming is that of static vs dynamic typing. I've heard a million arguments from both sides throughout my entire career, but seen very few of them ever convinced anyone of anything. As rationalizations masquerading as reason rarely do in matters of faith. The rider will always justify the way of the elephant.
