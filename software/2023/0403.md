A deep dive into the evolution of React from client-side view library to application architecture. Releated: [React Labs: What We've Been Working On – March 2023](https://react.dev/blog/2023/03/22/react-labs-what-we-have-been-working-on-march-2023).

We call on all AI labs to immediately pause for at least 6 months the training of AI systems more powerful than GPT-4. Releated:

**IPFS Implementations: It’s Definitely A Thing**  
https://blog.ipfs.tech/2023-03-implementation-principles/  
These are exciting times: solidifying our foundations empowers us to build higher and better. The next IPFS Thing (opens new window)is just a few weeks away, April 15th-19th, in Brussels. As a community, we'll be using that opportunity to share, discuss, and blaze forward with many new IPFS capabilities and implementations. We have no doubt that, from these CIDs, many flowers will grow. Releated: [Announcing the Content Tracks for IPFS Thing 2023](https://blog.ipfs.tech/2023-ipfs-thing-content-tracks/).

**JavaScript import maps are now supported cross-browser**

With import maps, importing ES modules now becomes a lot better.

**In Praise of Vite**  
https://cloudfour.com/thinks/in-praise-of-vite/  
There are a lot of technical reasons why Vite is great. But for me, it removes the single most painful part of modern web development. At the end of the day, it just works. With very little instruction, it does everything I want. Load this file, process it as needed, and let me get back to writing code. Releated: [Migrate to Vite from Create React App (CRA)](https://www.robinwieruch.de/vite-create-react-app/).

**Thoughts on Svelte**  
https://tyhopp.com/notes/thoughts-on-svelte  
I enjoyed the Svelte experience on the whole. Highlights are the component format, built-in stores, and the event dispatcher API. Lowlights are reactive statements ($), await blocks, and built-in transition and animation APIs.

**From Web2 to Web3: How developers can upskill and build with blockchain**  
https://stackoverflow.blog/2023/03/29/from-web2-to-web3-how-developers-can-upskill-and-build-with-blockchain/  
Why web3 is here to stay and how developers can build killer dapps.

**docker**

https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35307640  
https://www.docker.com/blog/no-longer-sunsetting-the-free-team-plan/  
Lately I tend to stick to topics that are historic by at least twenty years, and that does have a lot of advantages. But I am supposedly a DevOps professional, and so I will occasionally indulge in giving DevOps advice... or at least opinions, which are sort of like advice but with less of a warranty.

**Twitter's Recommendation Algorithm**  
https://blog.twitter.com/engineering/en_us/topics/open-source/2023/twitter-recommendation-algorithm  
Twitter aims to deliver you the best of what’s happening in the world right now. This requires a recommendation algorithm to distill the roughly 500 million Tweets posted daily down to a handful of top Tweets that ultimately show up on your device’s For You timeline. This blog is an introduction to how the algorithm selects Tweets for your timeline. Our recommendation system is composed of many interconnected services and jobs, which we will detail in this post. While there are many areas of the app where Tweets are recommended—Search, Explore, Ads—this post will focus on the home timeline’s For You feed. Releated: [The Twitter API is now effectively unmaintained](https://snarfed.org/the-twitter-api-is-now-effectively-unmaintained).  

**How we built it: Stripe Radar**  
https://stripe.com/blog/how-we-built-it-stripe-radar  
To identify fraudulent transactions, we rely on the breadth of the Stripe network—our biggest strength. We’ve done so by improving our machine learning (ML) architecture while enhancing the way we communicate with users about the reasons behind fraud decisions. In this post, we want to share what makes Radar so powerful and take you through some of the key decisions we’ve made—and lessons we’ve learned—over the almost seven years we’ve been building it.

Fully embracing a remote workplace means letting everyone work when they want to work.

**失业三个月，我都干了啥？**  
https://ourai.ws/posts/what-i-have-done-in-2023-q1/  
读书无用，知识有用；知识无用，智慧有用；智慧无用，生活至上——这二十四个字，不是我从哪看的，听谁说的，而是自己总结出的——如有雷同，纯属巧合。这二十四字，每八字为一组，呈递进关系，代表着三个认知层次。

**阿里分家，并没有“放权红利”**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/bht_ND-CiRdSBYDnonPDXw  
面对互联网的机会，关明生“杀人放火”，把过去两年高大上的搞法完全推翻，阿里才穿过寒冬，登上互联网这艘船。面对移动互联网的机会，马云让立下赫赫战功的CEO陆兆禧下课，不再执着于社交APP来往，手淘出世，登上移动互联网的船。面对AI的这一次呢？如果阿里真有决心，1+6+N，只是热身。另附：[阿里换上白袍](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/DNoGsaBwl1I-DKKPdUV50w)。
