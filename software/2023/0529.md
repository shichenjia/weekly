**Why React is Here to Stay**  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADKvP8Xn4g8  
There are so many alternatives to React nowadays. Every framework seems to be doing at least something better than React does. I wanted to address some points made by Adam Elmore, who is leaving React, as these make for a great discussion. Releated: [Why I Use Elm in 2023](https://taylor.town/elm-2023).

**How Code Suggestions can supercharge developers' daily productivity**  
https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2023/05/25/code-suggestions-improves-developer-productivity/  
In the fast-paced world of software development, time is a precious resource. Developers constantly strive for ways to improve the productivity and efficiency of their workflows. Enter Code Suggestions, a large language model (LLM)-based technology that can transform the everyday developer experience. Let’s delve into the novel use cases of Code Suggestions, including: simplifying operations; assisting new developers in language explorations; eliminating the need for frequent web searches by experienced developers. All of these are examples of how Code Suggestions can accelerate the daily developer experience. Let’s explore some specific examples of these use cases. Releated:

**AI Canon** 
https://a16z.com/2023/05/25/ai-canon/  
Research in artificial intelligence is increasing at an exponential rate. It’s difficult for AI experts to keep up with everything new being published, and even harder for beginners to know where to start. So, in this post, we’re sharing a curated list of resources we’ve relied on to get smarter about modern AI. We call it the “AI Canon” because these papers, blog posts, courses, and guides have had an outsized impact on the field over the past several years.

**Using ChatGPT for home automation**

I’ve been creating ChatGPT plugins and started thinking - wouldn’t it be fun to connect this to a Raspberry Pi and control some hardware? Turns out, it’s very easy to do. Releated:

**Why we're bad at CSS**  
https://www.mikeaparicio.com/posts/2023-05-22-why-were-bad-at-css/  
When many devs think of CSS they think of Peter Griffin trying to open window blinds. But for others CSS is more like putting their hand in the pain box from Dune while some product manager has a gom jabbar to their neck, daring them to pull their hand out.

**Same Stop**  
https://www.engineersneedart.com/index.html  
I retired a year and a half ago after having worked for twenty-six years as a programmer for Apple. I’m not sure which would have been more surprising: if I had continued programming in my spare time after I had retired or if I never programmed again.

**What Does Being a Good Leader Mean? Making Life Easier for Your Team**  
https://spin.atomicobject.com/2023/05/28/good-leader/  
Having conversations around software development and career advancement you’ll hear a lot about these leadership skills. These are incredibly valuable to helping projects go smoothly and end in success. Everyone has been on a team where nobody is leading, or, worse yet, the wrong person is leadin. The resulting mess of daily work seems to result in an endless list of messes as if by magic. Constant technical issues, inefficient processes, and lack of direction are all common signs of bad or missing leadership.

**《论语》之仁者无敌（二）**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/lTs_rArQ3LnBhuCxOrjvXQ  
仁这个理念本来就是服务于个人，家族，乡党乃至于国家的存续的，并不是一个虚无缥缈的人伪道德理念。先秦的时候，譬如仁义礼智信的五德，其实并不是用来区分现在所谓的好人还是坏人，而是客观的指标，它们决定个人的修为和境界在哪一个层次，是更接近于道，抑或是更青睐物；是能从事公共管理的君子，抑或是只适合自扫门前雪的小人。

**人生不长，早做准备**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/q8WAxVXQVPpwXBQuoQRBZA  
人生只有一件大事，就是：健康长寿。除此之外，都是次要的。健康长寿，是每个人要去的地方，就是大鹏要去的「南冥」。健康长寿是需要提前准备和条件具足的。没有人会以为它是自然发生的，但是，似乎我们很多人都迷失在每日的工作和生活里面，很少有人去思考和准备？
