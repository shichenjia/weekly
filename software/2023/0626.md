**The Five-Year Rule of Software Transitions**  
https://blog.robenkleene.com/2023/06/19/software-transitions-the-five-year-rule/  
I’ve been watching this kind of software for a long time, looking for trends, ideally based on any market share numbers I find. Over time I’ve noticed something interesting: Transitions in this kind of software almost always happen in the same way. In particular they happen quickly. And once they get going, they always seem to take roughly the same amount of time. I call this the “Five-Year Rule”. The rule is simple: Either a new piece of software will become the market leader in about five years, or it never will.

**The data visualisation technology landscape**  
https://visualisingdata.com/2023/06/data-visualisation-technology-landscape/  
My work in the data visualisation field has never been overly-aligned with the technology side of things. I’ve always focused my approach towards transferring knowledge about the underlying craft of visually communicating with data, agnostic of technology. However, you can’t ignore technology and the prominent role it plays in the practice of this craft. From gathering data, cleaning and transforming it, exploring it, analysing it, charting it, finessing its appearance, technology – or more accurately technologies – is key. In this post I want to try to at least direct you towards some useful resources that may at least help you, if you have a similar question in mind, find your own answers.

**The New CSS**  
https://matthiasott.com/notes/the-new-css  
If you attended this year’s CSS Day in Amsterdam, however, or watched the videos via the live stream, like I did, you might have noticed that this time, something feels different. This time, the changes coming to CSS are so fundamental on so many levels that it almost feels like a singularity. There is now the CSS before and the CSS after the early 2020s.

**Announcing Svelte 4**  
https://svelte.dev/blog/svelte-4  
Svelte 4 reduces the Svelte package size by nearly 75% (10.6 MB down to 2.8 MB), which means less waiting on npm install. Svelte 4 makes the Svelte authoring experience more intuitive and consistent: |local is now the default for transitions to avoid animations blocking page transitions, preprocessors are now easier to write, and multiple fixes make CSP easier to set up and use.

**What Observability-Driven Development Is Not**  
https://www.honeycomb.io/blog/observability-driven-development  
At Honeycomb, we are all about observability. In the past, we have proposed observability-driven development as a way to maximize your observability and supercharge your development process. But I have a problem with the terminology, and it is: I don’t want observability to drive your development.

**We have left the cloud**  
https://world.hey.com/dhh/we-have-left-the-cloud-251760fb  
Since it took us years to get into the cloud in the first place, I originally imagined it would take us years to get out as well. But all that work to containerize our applications and prepare them for the cloud actually turned out to make it relatively easy to exit. And now, after six months of effort, it's done. We're out. The last application was brought home to our own hardware on Wednesday. Hallelujah!
