**Google vs. the Open Web**  
https://interpeer.io/blog/2023/07/google-vs-the-open-web/  
https://github.com/RupertBenWiser/Web-Environment-Integrity/blob/main/explainer.md  
Google is trying to kill the Open Web: Using the proposed “Web Environment Integrity” means websites can select on which devices (browsers) they wish to be displayed, and can refuse service to other devices. It binds client side software to a website, creating a silo’d app. Releated:

**How the creator of Homebrew simplifies distributing software with tea and Deno**  
https://deno.com/blog/tea-simplifies-distributing-software  
tea, the spiritual successor to Homebrew, is a command-line universal interpreter, environment manager, and dependency manager that uses blockchain technology to compensate open source software maintainers. Since launching in November 2022, tea has over 10,000 users and is growing.

**How and why typography affects ease of reading**  
https://legible-typography.com/en/  
The invention of typography, print, and more recently digitization and the internet brought about an abundance of documents and made the need for legible communication unquestionable. The stakes are as high as the numbers of documents and readers. Professional typographers, graphic designers, UX designers, DTP operators, software developers, casual users of word-processing software, all in one way or another design documents thus affecting their ease of reading. But what exactly is legibility and how can we design documents that are easier to read?

**GitHub Repository Rules are now generally available**  
https://github.blog/2023-07-24-github-repository-rules-are-now-generally-available/  
Repository rules provide an easy, flexible way to define branch protections and ensure consistency in code across repositories.

**A comprehensive guide to running Llama 2 locally**  
https://replicate.com/blog/run-llama-locally  
We’ve been talking a lot about how to run and fine-tune Llama 2 on Replicate. But you can also run Llama locally on your M1/M2 Mac, on Windows, on Linux, or even your phone. The cool thing about running Llama 2 locally is that you don’t even need an internet connection. Releated:

**Hono + htmx + Cloudflare is a new stack**  
https://blog.yusu.ke/hono-htmx-cloudflare/  
As a former backend engineer, I sometimes find React complex. Moreover, as a framework developer, creating a hydration mechanism can be troublesome. But we often end up using React. One of the main advantages of using React is JSX. At first, JSX seems strange - “Why are HTML tags in JavaScript!!!” However, once I get used to it, I find that JSX is flexible and comfortable to use. Today, I’ll introduce a tech stack where the main point is using JSX purely as a server-side template engine. This means we can use JSX without React.

**Shopify’s platform is the Web platform**  
https://shopify.engineering/shopifys-platform-is-the-web-platform  
Remix is now the recommended way to build Admin apps on Shopify. With Remix, you get a best-in-class developer experience while ensuring exceptional out-of-the-box performance for your app. Remix also embraces the web platform and web standards, allowing web developers to use more of their existing knowledge and skills when developing for Shopify. We are reshaping Shopify’s platform to embody the same values, for example by releasing a new, web-centric version of App Bridge.

**DX in the frontend developer ecosystem**  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N17BLxy2Kbc  
Web development reinvents itself every day. There are new tools and browser features, redefined best practices, and everything’s changing, always… But are we on the right track? And what role does developer experience play in all this? Let’s look at new (and old) Frontend trends to find out, if we're reinventing the wheel for a reason or if sites built yesterday are maybe as good as the cutting edge.

**Why is DNS still hard to learn?**  
https://jvns.ca/blog/2023/07/28/why-is-dns-still-hard-to-learn/  
I write a lot about technologies that I found hard to learn about. A while back my friend Sumana asked me an interesting question – why are these things so hard to learn about? Why do they seem so mysterious?

**The Most Important Coding Habits**  
https://puppycoding.com/2023/07/22/healthy-coding-habits/  
I’ve just learnt the hard way that the most important coding habits are not readability, consistency, organisation or any of the things that make our code better. No, the most important habits are those that enable us to enjoy this craft for years and decades to come.

**Effective Code Reviews**  
https://addyosmani.com/blog/code-reviews/  
A well-conducted code review is an opportunity for both the author and the reviewer to learn, share knowledge, and contribute to the overall quality of the software. They are our shared journey towards excellence. The following guidelines may help both authors and reviewers carry out this task more efficiently and constructively.

**Simple Sabotage Field Manual - How to Destroy Your Organizations**  
https://butwhatfor.beehiiv.com/p/simple-sabotage-field-manual-destroy-organizations  
The purpose of this paper is to characterize simple sabotage, to outline its possible effects, and to present suggestions for inciting and executing it.

**The Fall of Stack Overflow**  
https://observablehq.com/@ayhanfuat/the-fall-of-stack-overflow  
https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36855516  
Over the past one and a half years, Stack Overflow has lost around 50% 35% of its traffic (Update: Around 15% of the observed loss seems to be related to the recategorization of the Google Analytics Cookie around May 2022. The chart was updated to only include data after that change). 

**How Heptabase’s founder use Heptabase for learning, research, planning, and writing**  
https://medium.com/heptabase/how-heptabases-founder-use-heptabase-for-learning-research-planning-and-writing-b11b1829ff79  
In this article, I will share how I have used Heptabase to help me learn, research, plan, and write over the past two years. I will also include screenshots of my whiteboards. However, due to the sensitive information related to company operations in many of the screenshots, I intentionally reduced the zoom ratio and made the content blurry. I believe that the experiences and ideas I describe in the article have greater inspirational value than the content of the notes themselves.

**吴晓波：回到创业大街**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/TKpkSnUgjLClT58dQOWXZw  
创业是一种病，惟有甘于平庸可以治愈。

**中国的“国本”到底在哪里？**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/rJZiIZ_4_xcVFoOmCVA1OQ  
八年前，我从互联网大厂离职，开启了创业生涯。因此也有了充足的时间，读万卷书、行万里路、阅人无数。走遍中国广袤的土地，才让自己的思维方式，摆脱了一线城市空调房/格子间里的信息茧房。可叹身边的“白领精英”们，尤其是从事互联网和金融领域的，却仍然以为自己是全中国信息最灵通的族群，殊不知早已落入资本和媒体打造的超级信息茧房里。一个人，有了真正自主的阅读和见闻，才会有真正自主的思考。

**门阀永远在路上：刀郎的《罗刹海市》在抗争什么？**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/Qd58Yhded4PjQ50Q83V3jQ  
每一个圈子、行业、社会乃至整个世界，一直都有大大小小的新旧势力在不断竖起一堵堵高墙。历来如此，一直如此。这种故事不但在中国历史上由来已久，而且是人类社会的通病。

**专访ChatGPT背后的科学家：OpenAI的300人工作方法论**  
https://new.qq.com/rain/a/20230728A06PTP00  
当探索的目的地变得未知，我们必须放下对最终目的地的执念。这就是“踏脚石原则”，即一个好的想法会带来另一个好的想法；一处宝藏会指向更多的宝藏，在可能发现的无限的踏脚石上，形成源源不断的连锁和分支。因此，你需要做的，就是成为一个熟练的寻宝者。如果你想成为一名行事无须设置特定目标的寻宝者，那么就要遵循一种特殊的线索，即当某些东西让你感觉有趣时，寻宝的旅程就可以开启。根据当前所处的位置，决定应该去哪里，往往比根据想要去哪里，来决定前进的方向要更明智。相关书籍：[为什么伟大不能被计划](https://book.douban.com/subject/36357804/)。
