**Introducing GPTs**  
https://openai.com/blog/introducing-gpts  
GPTs are a new way for anyone to create a tailored version of ChatGPT to be more helpful in their daily life, at specific tasks, at work, or at home—and then share that creation with others. For example, GPTs can help you learn the rules to any board game, help teach your kids math, or design stickers. Anyone can easily build their own GPT—no coding is required. You can make them for yourself, just for your company’s internal use, or for everyone. Creating one is as easy as starting a conversation, giving it instructions and extra knowledge, and picking what it can do, like searching the web, making images or analyzing data. Releated:

https://blog.angular.io/introducing-angular-v17-4d7033312e4b  
Last month marked the 13th anniversary of Angular’s red shield. AngularJS was the starting point for a new wave of JavaScript frameworks emerging to support the increasing need for rich web experiences. Today with a new look and a set of forward-thinking features we bring everyone along to the future with version 17, setting new standards for performance and developer experience.

**How Core Web Vitals saved users 10,000 years of waiting for web pages to load**  
https://blog.chromium.org/2023/11/how-core-web-vitals-saved-users-10000.html  
In 2020, we introduced Web Vitals - essential quality signals for webpages to ensure a better user experience. Since then, there has been a massive leap in web performance made possible by our work on Core Web Vitals (CWV) and its broader impact on the web. Today, over 40% of sites pass all of the CWV metrics, leading to pages that load and respond to interactions more quickly. Here’s a closer look at the journey to help improve the performance for sites and some specific work done in the browser and the ecosystem to enable this achievement. 

**Why You Want Need React Query**  
https://tkdodo.eu/blog/why-you-want-react-query  
React Query gives you a lot of features like caching, retries, polling, data synchronization, prefetching, ... and about a million more that would go way beyond the scope of this article. It's totally fine if you don't need them, but I still think this shouldn't stop you from using React Query.

**Headless Component: a pattern for composing React UIs**  
https://martinfowler.com/articles/headless-component.html  
As React UI controls become more sophisticated, complex logic can get intertwined with the visual representation. This makes it hard to reason about the behavior of the component, hard to test it, and necessary to build similar components that need a different look. A Headless Component extracts all non-visual logic and state management, separating the brain of a component from its looks.

**HTML web components**

https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2023/html-web-components/  
Web components have been around for quite a while, but it feels like they’re having a bit of a moment right now. It turns out that the best selling point for web components was “wait and see.” For everyone who didn’t see the benefit of web components over being locked into a specific framework, time is proving to be a great teacher.

**Announcing self-hosted Deno KV, continuous backups, and replicas**  
https://deno.com/blog/kv-is-open-source-with-continuous-backup  
As we expanded Deno KV with features like TTL, remote connections to hosted databases, read replicas for reduced latency, and Deno Queues, the issue of potential vendor lock-in emerged. We understand the importance of this concern. Deno is intentionally built on web standards. This aligns with our philosophy: knowing Deno means knowing the web, which empowers you to reach over a billion internet users. In line with our commitment to flexibility and openness, we’re excited to roll out these new features, empowering you to leverage Deno KV in the way that best suits your needs.
