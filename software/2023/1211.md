**Simplicity**  
https://commandcenter.blogspot.com/2023/12/simplicity.html  
In May 2009, Google hosted an internal "Design Wizardry" panel, with talks by Jeff Dean, Mike Burrows, Paul Haahr, Alfred Spector, Bill Coughran, and myself. Here is a lightly edited transcript of my talk. Some of the details have aged out, but the themes live on, now perhaps more than ever. Simplicity is better than complexity.

**Three Decades of HTML**  
https://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2023/12/06/three-decades-of-html/  
A few days ago was the 30th anniversary of the first time I wrote an HTML document.  Back in 1993, I took a Usenet posting of the “Incomplete Mystery Science Theater 3000 Episode Guide” and marked it up.  You can see the archived copy here on meyerweb.  At some point, the markup got updated for reasons I don’t remember, but I can guarantee you the original had uppercase tag names and I didn’t close any paragraphs. 

**Rethinking Serverless with FLAME**  
https://fly.io/blog/rethinking-serverless-with-flame/  
The pursuit of elastic, auto-scaling applications has taken us to silly places. Serverless/FaaS had a couple things going for it. Elastic Scale™ is hard. It’s even harder when you need to manage those pesky servers. It also promised pay-what-you-use costs to avoid idle usage. Good stuff, right?

**Upgrading GitHub.com to MySQL 8.0**  
https://github.blog/2023-12-07-upgrading-github-com-to-mysql-8-0/  
GitHub uses MySQL to store vast amounts of relational data. This is the story of how we seamlessly upgraded our production fleet to MySQL 8.0.

**Welcome to the Gemini era: Unlocking new ways to help you build and scale with AI**  
https://deepmind.google/technologies/gemini/#introduction  
https://blog.google/technology/ai/google-gemini-ai/  
Now, we’re taking the next step on our journey with Gemini, our most capable and general model yet, with state-of-the-art performance across many leading benchmarks. Our first version, Gemini 1.0, is optimized for different sizes: Ultra, Pro and Nano. These are the first models of the Gemini era and the first realization of the vision we had when we formed Google DeepMind earlier this year. This new era of models represents one of the biggest science and engineering efforts we’ve undertaken as a company. I’m genuinely excited for what’s ahead, and for the opportunities Gemini will unlock for people everywhere. Releated:

**Getting Started with React Native Skia**  
https://shopify.engineering/getting-started-with-react-native-skia  
Skia is a cross-platform 2D graphics library that provides a set of drawing primitives which run on iOS, Android, macOS, Windows, Linux, and the browser. Over the past two years, Shopify Engineering has sponsored development of the @shopify/react-native-skia library that exposes Skia functionality to React Native.

**You are never taught how to build quality software**  
https://www.florianbellmann.com/blog/never-taught-qa  
Have you ever been in on a software project that is missing vital quality assurance measures? You are not alone. This happens to a mind-blowing amount of companies and projects. Even if they know that there is this thing called QA and that we should do it, all efforts typically result in the big QA sprint right before the release. Stressful times that only make the software barely work. All of this chaos repeats in the next release cycle of course. No improvements.

**Building end-to-end security for Messenger**  
https://engineering.fb.com/2023/12/06/security/building-end-to-end-security-for-messenger/  
Today, we’re announcing that we’ve begun to upgrade people’s personal conversations on Messenger to use E2EE by default. Our aim is to ensure that everyone’s personal messages on Messenger can only be accessed by the sender and the intended recipients, and that everyone can be sure the messages they receive are from an authentic sender.

**DiffDebugging**  
https://martinfowler.com/bliki/DiffDebugging.html  
Regression bugs are newly appeared bugs in features of the software that have been around for a while. When hunting them, it usually valuable to figure out which change in the software caused them to appear. Looking at that change can give invaluable clues about where the bug is and how to squash it. There isn't a well-known term for this form of investigation, but I call it Diff Debugging.

**Self-hosted, not self-managed**  
https://medium.com/gitpod/self-hosted-not-self-managed-fe384ca7a9ee  
In December of 2022, we discontinued our self-managed offering. After three years of trying to make it work we realized that CDE platforms benefit from not being self-managed. While they can be self-hosted, self-management makes them less effective and more costly. In this article I’ll explain why self-managed CDEs do not offer the experience we wanted to provide to our customers — and what an alternative can look like.

This is the second of two related articles talking about the alternatives to product managers and product leaders.  In the first article, I discussed how the product manager’s responsibilities of value and viability can, under the right conditions, be covered by other approaches.

**绑架上帝——现代科技和工商文明的最大谎言**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/PEFNILTX3H2OX8kx9wNzCA  
现代科技和工商力量，试图把自己塑造成西方文明的正统。于是绑架圣经，以及圣经里的上帝，绑架苏格拉底，强行在他们的言论里找到现代科技和工商文明的萌芽。并且贿赂学者，把这个理论打扮成共识，然后给大众洗脑。跟这个计划配套的，就是把东方的孔子体系和西方的圣经/苏格拉底体系对立起来，把孔子体系打扮成反科技和工商的，反上帝的，令东方在最近几百年被打败的根源。

**最好的教育：有管、有教、有罚、有爱**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/bbaRBFypSO2jTsLXa-Nx-A  
教育孩子，从来不是一件简单的事情，为人父母，要学会对自己的孩子负责。父母之爱子，则为之计深远。如果你真的疼爱子女，就应当为孩子考虑得更长远些；有方法地爱，严格地爱，才是真正的爱。要知道，最好的教育，一定是宽严并济、奖罚分明的！有管，有教，有罚，才是对孩子最好的教育。

**百岁老道医总结的100条治病养生心得，有病无病，都要打开看看**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/cTtgTLYssKsJoAiRAtsWhA  
一旦你的修复功能减弱或丧失，那你就把命运交给这些药物了。记住，只要症状不严重，最好的办法是静养，安心静气让自身的修复系统来完成疾病的修复工作。所以，我们每个人都要慎用药物，让我们自身的修复系统功能恢复起来，这才是真正的健康之道。一切药物对治病来说都是治标，不是治本，不管是中医还是西医。因为一切的病都是错误的因产生错误的果。错误的因不除，错误的果就不会绝根。健康的根本在心。
