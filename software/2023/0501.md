**The future of programming: Research at CHI 2023**  
https://austinhenley.com/blog/futureofprogramming2023.html  
The esteemed CHI conference is happening this week, and I'm jealous that I can't be there. Instead, I'm going through the proceedings and reading all of the papers related to programming, of which many involve AI. Here are some papers that stood out to me.  Releated: [How AI coding companions will change the way developers work](https://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2023/04/how-ai-coding-companions-will-change-the-way-developers-work.html).  

**30th anniversary of licensing the Web for general use and at no cost**  
https://www.w3.org/blog/2023/04/30th-anniversary-of-licensing-the-web-for-general-use-and-at-no-cost/  
Today marks the 30th anniversary of the release of the World Wide Web into the public domain, for general use, and at no cost, on 30 April 1993 by CERN. This quiet gesture, advocated by Web inventor Sir Tim Berners-Lee, has had implications beyond what he or anyone imagined at that time: the Web, free for everyone, has changed our lives. Releated: [Internet in a Box](https://internet-in-a-box.org/).  

**Brutalist Websites**

In its ruggedness and lack of concern to look comfortable or easy, Brutalism can be seen as a reaction by a younger generation to the lightness, optimism, and frivolity of today's web design.

**A Gentle Introduction to Islands**  
https://deno.com/blog/intro-to-islands  
These goldilocks “just enough” sites are a problem for frameworks: you can’t statically generate these pages, but bundling an entire framework and sending it over a network for one image carousel button seems overkill. What can we do for these sites? Give them islands.

**Ten Things About AI**  
https://redmonk.com/sogrady/2023/04/27/ai-questions/  
The question that virtually the entire technology industry – along with the rest of the world – has been grappling with since is: what happens now? With all due respect to ChatGPT and its industry counterparts, all of which would likely answer that question quickly and confidently, it’s not answerable at present. It can be useful, however, to look at the current generation of AI through other smaller questions to begin to assess its possibilities and its portents. There are many more, but here are ten areas worthy of exploration and questions. Releated:

**Transformers from Scratch**  
https://e2eml.school/transformers.html  
https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35697627  
Transformers were introduced in this 2017 paper as a tool for sequence transduction—converting one sequence of symbols to another. The most popular examples of this are translation, as in English to German. It has also been modified to perform sequence completion—given a starting prompt, carry on in the same vein and style. They have quickly become an indispensible tool for research and product development in natural language processing. Releated:

**Rebuilding a featured news section with modern CSS: Vox news**  
https://ishadeed.com/article/rebuild-featured-news-modern-css/  
In this article, I will rethink how to build the featured news section on Vox.com and try to see if modern CSS will be helpful or not. For example, do we need to use container queries? Or fluid sizing? That’s the goal of this article. It’s a journey as I think aloud about building a layout that seems simple.

**Some mistakes I made as a new manager**  
https://www.benkuhn.net/newmgr/  
I had an unusually hard time becoming a manager: I went back and forth three times before it stuck, mostly because I made lots of mistakes each time. Since then, as I had to grow my team and grow other folks into managing part of it, I’ve seen a lot of other people have varying degrees of a rough time as well—often in similar ways. Here’s a small, lovingly hand-curated selection of my prodigious oeuvre of mistakes, and strategies that helped me mitigate them.

**If someone’s having to read your docs, it’s not “simple”**  
https://justsimply.dev/  
When I’m writing technical docs, annoyingly, I find myself putting “just” in all the time, despite having strongly-held views about words such as this. I think it’s because I’m so keen to share my enlightenment. It’s exciting that the code I’ve written might be able to help, and naturally I’m keen to communicate that. A bit of light editing lets you keep the enthusiasm for the code, lose the bits that could be interpreted as condescending, and improve the clarity, to boot.

**Agile! The Good, the Hype and the Ugly (review)**  
https://beza1e1.tuxen.de/agile_good_hype_ugly.html  
An Agile mindset is critical in modern software development and everybody who thinks differently is doomed to perish. So say the fans. Critics are appalled by such zeal and sometimes a heated discussion ensues. It doesn't help that many people with little practical experience chime in.

**《论语》之仁者无敌**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/zqdWcsnoMH5OuUYKG9182w  
子曰：“富与贵，是人之所欲也；不以其道得之，不处也。贫与贱，是人之所恶也；不以其道得之，不去也。君子去仁，恶乎成名？君子无终食之间违仁，造次必于是，颠沛必于是。”人人都喜欢富贵，厌恶贫贱，但如果不以道来获得富贵以及摆脱贫贱，那么君子宁可淡泊明志，宁静致远。君子如果没有了仁，还怎么成就名声？所以，君子没有什么时候会违背仁，再紧急困难的时候都不能背弃仁。
