**How a startup loses its spark**  
https://blog.johnqian.com/startup-spark  
At a well-run seed stage startup, engineers will often describe the work experience as intoxicating. At a larger company, the best you get is "enjoyable". Why does this happen? Is it inevitable?

**How we reduced the size of our JavaScript bundles by 33%**  
https://dropbox.tech/frontend/how-we-reduced-the-size-of-our-javascript-bundles-by-33-percent  
At Dropbox, we understand how incredibly annoying such experiences can be. Over the past year, our web performance engineering team narrowed some of our performance problems down to an oft-overlooked culprit: the module bundler.

**TypeScript is Surprisingly OK for Compilers**  
https://matklad.github.io/2023/08/17/typescript-is-surprisingly-ok-for-compilers.html#TypeScript-is-Surprisingly-OK-for-Compilers  
But OCaml is crufty! Is there something better? Today, I realized that TypeScript might actually be OK? It is not really surprising, given how the language works, but it never occured to me to think about TypeScript as an ML equivalent before. So, let’s write a tiny-tiny typechecker in TS!

**The future of open source is still very much in flux**  
https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/08/17/1077498/future-open-source/  
Free and open software have transformed the tech industry. But we still have a lot to work out to make them healthy, equitable enterprises. Releated: [Terraform: The OpenTF Manifesto](https://opentf.org/).

**How modular can your monolith go?**  
https://microservices.io//post/architecture/2023/08/20/how-modular-can-your-monolith-go-part-2.html  
In this article, I focus on the first two issues, and assume that a system operation consists of a single transaction that spans subdomains. In a later post, I’ll discuss transaction management in more detail.

**How we reduced the cost of building Twitter at Twitter-scale by 100x**  
https://blog.redplanetlabs.com/2023/08/15/how-we-reduced-the-cost-of-building-twitter-at-twitter-scale-by-100x/  
We recognize the way we’re introducing Rama is unusual. We felt that since the 100x cost reduction claim sounds so unbelievable, it wouldn’t do Rama justice to introduce it in the abstract. So we took it upon ourselves to directly demonstrate Rama’s 100x cost reduction by replicating a full application at scale in all its detail.

**Introducing Immortal Objects for Python**  
https://engineering.fb.com/2023/08/15/developer-tools/immortal-objects-for-python-instagram-meta/  
To get around this issue, we introduced Immortal Objects – PEP-683. This creates an immortal object (an object for which the core object state will never change) by marking a special value in the object’s reference count field. It allows the runtime to know when it can and can’t mutate both the reference count fields and GC header.

**Complexity Theory’s 50-Year Journey to the Limits of Knowledge**  
https://www.quantamagazine.org/complexity-theorys-50-year-journey-to-the-limits-of-knowledge-20230817/  
How hard is it to prove that problems are hard to solve? Meta-complexity theorists have been asking questions like this for decades. A string of recent results has started to deliver answers.

**青年就业难，路在何方？**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/Knve_SVp036Y9d0sYvo1hw  
青年失业是一个全球性难题，这个特殊群体的失业率通常是社会平均失业率的2到3倍。即使在一些发达国家，高青年失业率的问题也无法摆脱。事实很残酷，却也清晰无比：经济得到比较明显的修复或者有新兴产业出现前，当前的就业困境其实很难改变。

中华民族是热爱和平的民族，和平、和睦、和谐的追求深深植根于中华民族的精神世界之中。习近平总书记指出：“中华文明具有突出的和平性，从根本上决定了中国始终是世界和平的建设者、全球发展的贡献者、国际秩序的维护者”。深刻理解中华文明突出的和平性，对于全面认识中华文明历久弥新、绵延不断的发展历程，对于今天走和平发展道路，推动构建人类命运共同体都有着十分重要的意义。本期学术版围绕“中华文明具有突出的和平性”进行阐述。另附：
