**Patterns for building LLM-based systems and products**  
https://eugeneyan.com/writing/llm-patterns/  
This post is about practical patterns for integrating large language models (LLMs) into systems and products. We’ll draw from academic research, industry resources, and practitioner know-how, and try to distill them into key ideas and practices. There are seven key patterns. I’ve also organized them along the spectrum of improving performance vs. reducing cost/risk, and closer to the data vs. closer to the user. Releated:

**Type vs Interface: Which Should You Use In 2023?**  
https://www.totaltypescript.com/type-vs-interface-which-should-you-use  
The difference between type and interface is small enough that you'll be able to use either one without many problems. But the TS team recommends you default to using interface and only use type when you need to. I'd like to recommend the opposite. The features of declaration merging and implicit index signatures are surprising enough that they should scare you off using interfaces by default. Interfaces are still my recommendation for object inheritance, but I'd recommend you use type by default. It's a little more flexible and a little less surprising.

**How we build containerized services at GitHub using GitHub**

Learn about how we build containerized services that power microservices on the GitHub.com platform and many internal tools.

**The value of a prototype is in the insight it imparts, not the code**  
https://addyosmani.com/blog/prototypes/  
Prototyping lets us fail fast and cheap, or get the data to make a concrete decision on direction. It helps answer the question, "What happens if we try this?". Most significantly, prototyping provides us with the guardrails to safely and productively fail. Failure is an integral part of the process of learning.

**美团前端研发框架Rome实践和演进趋势**  
https://tech.meituan.com/2023/08/03/meituan-rome-practice.html  
在Rome整体立项时，我们已经准备好了相关的基础设施，包括发布系统的收敛、基础架构，统一为基于S3（美团内部存储服务）加动静分离的技术架构，但是上层开发框架、组件类库种类繁多且开发方式不统一。存在问题包括：整个团队中人数比较多，学习交接、建设维护成本相对较高，而整体开发的效率比较低，跨团队之间的工程能力也很难进行复用等等。建设之初，我们基于纯静态S3（美团内部存储服务）架构进行前端框架的建设，这源于我们早期大量基于Node.js的前后端一体架构存在一些问题：首先，事业群早期以中后台场景业务为主，对页面的秒开、SEO的诉求比较低；其次，当时Node.js生态基建还没有那么完善，前端同学需要做动态扩缩容、峰值流量处理等操作，整体的业务风险比较高。同时还存在机器成本高、开发人员能力要求高、招聘难度大等问题。

**A Tale of Evading JavaScript Anti-Debugging Techniques**  
https://www.nullpt.rs/evading-anti-debugging-techniques  
Debuggers serve as invaluable tools that empower developers to halt code execution and thoroughly analyze its behavior at any given moment. By utilizing a debugger, developers can efficiently identify and resolve issues within their code, making it an indispensable part of their toolkit.

**I'm betting on HTML**  
https://catskull.net/html.html  
With the advent of large language model-based artificial intelligence, semantic HTML is more important now than ever. At its core, the internet is used to transmit data that helps humans interact with the world as they perceive it. The freedom that HTML/CSS/JS provide is a double-edged sword because access to data has become limited. Instead of open and accessible data formats and APIs, we’re kept within the walled gardens of major technology companies that operate mass social media sites.

**Rebuilding the Replit Filetree for Superior Performance and Accessibility**  
https://blog.replit.com/filetree-updates  
This filetree worked for small projects but started to have some performance issues as projects grew in size. This was particularly noticeable once we started using Replit to build Replit – our web repo had around 8000 files. We decided to revamp the filetree, and today, we’re excited to share the improvements we’ve made, focusing on performance and accessibility.

**A Foundations-First Approach to Product Design**

Today’s consumers expect greatness when it comes to the products they use. To get there, start with the basics.

**End-to-end testing for Confluence Forge apps**  
https://blog.developer.atlassian.com/end-to-end-testing-for-confluence-forge-apps/  
When building a Forge app for an Atlassian product, it's important to have a robust testing strategy in place. End-to-end testing provides a way to constantly monitor the quality and reliability of apps and, in this blog post, we will explore how to leverage Mocha and Webdriver.io to test two Confluence apps. We will also provide code samples and a video recording of the tests running, helping you get started quickly and confidently.

**Splitting the Web**  
https://ploum.net/2023-08-01-splitting-the-web.html  
There’s an increasing chasm dividing the modern web. On one side, the commercial, monopolies-riddled, media-adored web. A web which has only one objective: making us click. It measures clicks, optimises clicks, generates clicks. It gathers as much information as it could about us and spams every second of our life with ads, beep, notifications, vibrations, blinking LEDs, background music and fluorescent titles.

在一个个传统行业发生变革的时候，教育走向何方，教育不变吗，教育也会像商业那样会像金融那样吗？未来的学校也会消减吗？这是一个值得我们思考的问题，新教育给自己的定位就是为未来中国教育探路，也就是说未来中国教育走向何方，新教育作为一个先行者进行探索。
