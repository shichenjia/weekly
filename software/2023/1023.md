**Building The Next Web**  
https://berjon.com/next-web/  
Altogether too often, we consider some aspects of the Web as being invariants when they're potentially just as replaceable as any other part. This isn't to say that there are no invariants on the Web. For instance, it would make no architectural sense to talk of a Web without user agents — it's a foundational component and necessary constraint. However, browsers — which are often considered immovable — are only one implementation of the user agent component to which we can imagine alternatives with different properties.

**Forget "No Code." Adios "Low Code." Say hello to "Yes Code!"**  
https://stackoverflow.blog/2023/10/20/vercel-gen-ai-vo-web-components-interface/  
We chat with Lee Robinson, VP of Developer Experience at Vercel, about v0: a generative AI Vercel built that produces code for web components based on a user's text description of a UI or interface.

**What Every Developer Should Know About GPU Computing**

A primer on GPU architecture and computing

**Deno KV internals: building a database for the modern web**  
https://deno.com/blog/building-deno-kv  
The development of Deno KV was informed by the needs of modern web development and the possibilities presented by FoundationDB. Our emphasis has always been on functionality, scalability, and the seamless integration of JavaScript. By leveraging FoundationDB’s lock-free system and introducing features like the transaction layer and speculative execution, we aimed to address both performance and user experience.

**The future of full-stack Rails: Turbo Morph Drive**  
https://evilmartians.com/chronicles/the-future-of-full-stack-rails-turbo-morph-drive  
The “getting-back-into-full-stack” trend in web development communities is gaining more traction. Frontend frameworks are trying to embrace server components, htmx is the new black, and LiveView and LiveWire are conquering Elixir and Laravel applications, respectively. And, of course, Ruby on Rails has its newer offspring, Hotwire. Let’s explore how far you can go with the full-stack approach in Rails, and what the future might hold!

**Better HTTP server routing in Go 1.22**  
https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2023/better-http-server-routing-in-go-122/  
An exciting proposal is expected to land in Go 1.22 - enhancing the pattern-matching capabilities of the default HTTP serving multiplexer in the net/http package. The existing multiplexer (http.ServeMux) offers rudimentary path matching, but not much beyond that. This led to a cottage industry of 3rd party libraries to implement more powerful capabilities.

**Safe URLs 101: Spotting the Red Flags**  
https://catonmat.net/safe-urls-101  
TLDR: You can use Browserling (that I and my team built) to check if a URL is safe or not. We run browsers in the cloud in virtual machines and you get a remote connection to a browser. This way, you can open any bad URLs without the risk of infecting your device as everything runs in this this remote browser.

**We have used too many levels of abstractions and now the future looks bleak**  
https://unixsheikh.com/articles/we-have-used-too-many-levels-of-abstractions-and-now-the-future-looks-bleak.html  
A big percentage of so-called experts today only know how to configure some kind of hype-tool, but they understand nothing about how things work at the deeper level. This is a real challenge and a big problem for the future.

**Solid.js Creator Outlines Options to Reduce JavaScript Code**  
https://thenewstack.io/solid-js-creator-outlines-options-to-reduce-javascript-code/  
Solid.js creator Ryan Carniato thinks it's time to put JavaScript code on a diet. Here's how he recommends trimming it down to size.

**Apple’s use of Swift and SwiftUI in iOS 17**  
https://blog.timac.org/2023/1019-state-of-swift-and-swiftui-ios17/  
Now that iOS 17 is available, let’s analyze its built-in apps to answer a few questions: How many binaries are in iOS 17? Which programming languages are used to develop these apps? How many apps are written with Swift? What is the percentage of apps using SwiftUI versus UIKit?

**Write more "useless" software**  
https://ntietz.com/blog/write-more-useless-software/  
As technologists, we spend our days mired in making useful things. Software engineers write code to solve real problems. Computer scientists research problems to produce novel, real results. Technical writers write about actual technology, write real documentation, and more. The list goes on, and the common thread is that if we do technical work, we do it in the context of something useful.

**What Came First, Math or Computing?**  
https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2023/11/277437-what-came-first-math-or-computing/fulltext  
Mathematics does not transcend computation after all. Rather, computation is at the very heart of mathematics. So, what came first, math or computing? Neither! They were both developed by humans as a way to reason about the physical world. Math and computing have been entwined for the past 40,000 years and will continue to be so.

**Nota: A Document Language for the Browser**  
https://nota-lang.org/  
Nota is a language for writing documents, like academic papers and blog posts. The goal of Nota is to bring documents into the 21st century. Documents contain a lot of structure — for example, "Nota" is a reference to a term defined in the preceding paragraph. Nota enables authors to represent that structure, which allows the reading medium (the browser) to understand that structure, which in turn empowers readers to use that structure. 

**The Product Model at Spotify**  
https://www.svpg.com/product-model-at-spotify/  
Like other product model companies, Spotify recognizes that the most innovative ideas—those that truly resonate with customers—often originate from those who engage with the enabling technology daily – the engineers. They are uniquely positioned to identify emerging possibilities. Great leaders understand the necessity of creating an environment where empowered product teams can exercise their creativity, discovering and delivering innovative solutions that not only customers love, but also drive business success.

**从未断流的中华文明，做对了什么**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/M5GQfa_Vdcg5dBmccnMz9Q  
灿烂的文化有赖于悠久历史的酝酿与沉淀，伟大的文明更需要放置在时间的尺幅上去丈量。否则，一旦文化传统断裂，文明便失去了它的灵魂。另附：[为强国建设、民族复兴注入强大精神力量](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/7RC6S3uJP9-GXMBFV8cBJw)。

**国学的根本是心性修养**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/-GIqcGQFYDtM_Fob58sj3A  
国学往深的一面说肯定是心性修养。人之所以为人，需要有教养和文化，这两点就表现在心性修养上。人们要在社会网络中和谐共存，就需要优秀的心性结构，否则人和社会就妖魔化了。心性修养，归纳起来就是要让人成为儒家说的“君子”、道家说的“真人”、佛教说的“菩萨”。“心”的修养是智慧提升，“性”就是禀赋结构，属于道德范畴。用儒家的话来说，修身齐家治国平天下肯定要让君子来承担，哪怕小到一个家庭的和谐也需要优秀的心性结构。

**让家越来越旺的五种方式**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/6_eqp2uPXFMsWjNQvtxVWA  
钱钟书说：“人生不过是居家，出门，又回家。”世界那么大，我们最牵挂的，不过是一个小小的家。但温暖繁盛的家，并非凭空而来，而是靠一家人的用心经营。从古至今，最旺家的方式就是5个字：勤、和、书、孝、善。
