**The Staff Engineer's Path — Book Review**  
https://smyachenkov.com/posts/book-review-the-staff-engineers-path/  
https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35974845  
The first thing the book addresses is the question: Who is the staff engineer, and how are they different from IC and management roles? What are their priorities, skills, scopes, expectations, and position at the corporate charts and ladders? Favorite Quotes:  
- Early in your career, if you do a great job on something that turns out to be unnecessary, you’ve still done a great job. At the staff engineer level, everything you do has a high opportunity cost, so your work needs to be important.  
- You build credibility every time you take on a chaotic situation and make it easier for everyone else to understand.  
- Know why the problem you’re working on is strategically important, and if it’s not, do something else.  
- Whenever there’s a feeling of “someone should do something here”, there s a reasonable chance that this someone is you.  
- Writing about engineering strategy is hard because good strategy is pretty boring, and it’s kind of boring to write about. If you write something interesting, it’s probably wrong.

**Messenger Desktop: Faster and Smaller by moving to React Native from Electron**  
https://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/2023/05/17/messenger-desktop-faster-and-smaller-by-moving-to-react-native-from-electron/  
React Native has been an excellent tool for creating mobile applications at Meta. It allows us to build feature-rich mobile experiences reaching millions of users every day. With growing demands for our desktop applications, our team explored whether React Native could provide similar wins for desktop development at Meta. We were able to partner with Microsoft to rewrite Messenger Desktop with React Native for Desktop. In this post, we'll go over the challenges we had with Electron and why React Native was the right choice for us.

**How I Re-implemented PyTorch for WebGPU**  
https://praeclarum.org/2023/05/19/webgpu-torch.html  
I’ve been working on a WebGPU optimized inference and autograd library called webgpu-torch with an API that matches PyTorch. The goal is to run neural networks in the browser at speeds comparable to a Linux workstation. Many kernels have been implemented and its design is easily extensible. It’s available on NPM now and works in both the browser and Node.js!

**How immutable scripts in Deno allow Windmill.dev (YC S22) to build production-grade ops**  
https://deno.com/blog/immutable-scripts-windmill-production-grade-ops  
We've been happy using Deno in production at Windmill — it's simplified development, added a layer of security, and ensured optimal performance for our enterprise clients. In the future, we aim to match serverless / AWS lambda performance by integrating more deeply with Deno and running it in process.

“总而言之，我们的迁移决定基于实际需求，而绝不是什么立场问题。长期以来，我们一直以求真务实的态度构建 SvelteKit（反而是在 Svelte 那边更多追求理想主义），毕竟在这边提高生产力才是硬道理。”Rich Harris 总结道。

**How to Host Dynamic Content on IPFS**  
https://blog.ipfs.tech/2023-how-to-host-dynamic-content-on-ipfs/  
The InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) is a distributed, peer-to-peer file system designed to make the web faster, safer, and more resilient. Although IPFS excels at hosting static content, hosting dynamic content remains a challenge. This article presents a design for hosting dynamic content on IPFS using InterPlanetary Linked Data (IPLD), InterPlanetary Name Service (IPNS), and DHT Provider Records.

**Numbers every LLM Developer should know**  
https://github.com/ray-project/llm-numbers  
At Google, there was a document put together by Jeff Dean, the legendary engineer, called Numbers every Engineer should know. It’s really useful to have a similar set of numbers for LLM developers to know that are useful for back-of-the envelope calculations. Here we share particular numbers we at Anyscale use, why the number is important and how to use it to your advantage. Releated:

**Digital Audio Workstation Front End Development Struggles**  
https://billydm.github.io/blog/daw-frontend-development-struggles/  
I would like to write about where my head's been the past several months. If you've noticed that Meadowlark's development has slowed down, this article explains why. Essentially I've really underestimated how difficult it would be to develop the frontend/GUI of Meadowlark. Not just with how complicated a DAW's GUI is, but also in finding a GUI library that is actually suitable for the task. I want to use this blog post to do three things. First I want to highlight why this is such a hard problem. Second I want to share my thoughts on the current state of Rust's GUI library ecosystem. And third I want to share some potential paths I can take for the future of Meadowlark.

**Addressing GitHub’s recent availability issues**  
https://github.blog/2023-05-16-addressing-githubs-recent-availability-issues/  
GitHub recently experienced several availability incidents, both long running and shorter duration. We have since mitigated these incidents and all systems are now operating normally. Read on for more details about what caused these incidents and what we’re doing to mitigate in the future.

**Building and deploying MySQL Raft at Meta**  
https://engineering.fb.com/2023/05/16/data-infrastructure/mysql-raft-meta/  
At Meta, we run one of the largest deployments of MySQL in the world. The deployment powers the social graph along with many other services, like Messaging, Ads, and Feed. Over the last few years, we have implemented MySQL Raft, a Raft consensus engine that was integrated with MySQL to build a replicated state machine.

**My 20 Year Career is Technical Debt or Deprecated**  
https://blog.visionarycto.com/p/my-20-year-career-is-technical-debt  
Technical debt is easily the most used buzzword these days. People say, “We are moving fast on our MVP while minimizing technical debt!”. They mention technical debt in there to sound cool or something. I just laugh because everything is technical debt, eventually. My entire career is now technical debt, or the code has been deprecated. Everything eventually becomes tech debt, or the projects get sunsetted. If you are lucky, your code survives long enough to be technical debt to someone else. Given enough time, all your code will get deleted.

**世间便有六道轮回，你在哪一道？**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/IwLcTLJe9b2MaeUna-B_Xg  
人道代表的就是中道，所谓天地人、佛魔人，人是居中的，中道才是真道、正道。能真正具备这样一份仁义之心的人，在世间更是少数中的少数，他们是这个世间真正的希望和担当者。看似难得，却也本应是最基本的，没什么不可能的，不过就是好好地做个人，做个好好的人。人总是希冀更高的智慧，所缺的其实只是常识；人总是追求更高的境界，所差的不过是最基本。
