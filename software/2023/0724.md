**Effective > Productive**  
https://world.hey.com/jason/effective-productive-acfa210d  
So much talk about hacking productivity these days. There’s an endless stream of methodologies and tools promising to make you more productive. But more productive at what? Productivity is for machines, not for people. There’s nothing meaningful about packing some number of work units into some amount of time or squeezing more into less. Machines can work 24/7; humans can’t. When people focus on productivity, they end up focusing on being busy. Filling every moment with something to do. And there’s always more to do!

**Returning to First Principles: Disciplined Problem Solving**  
https://spin.atomicobject.com/2023/07/23/first-principles-problem-solving/  
Computers and software systems are complex and there are a myriad of ways things can go wrong. One way to realign ourselves with the fundamental factors that guide our decision-making and the foundation of our understanding is by returning to first principles when solving problems. I was recently reminded of the importance of applying a disciplined, no-assumption-left-unquestioned, first-principles approach while troubleshooting some client networking challenges. I wanted to share this reminder.

**Good code is like a love letter to the next developer who will maintain it**  
https://addyosmani.com/blog/good-code/  
https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36807028  
In the end, coding is an act of creation, not unlike writing a poem or painting a picture. The beauty of our creations, however, is not judged solely by the elegance of our algorithms or the efficiency of our code, but by the joy and ease with which others can build upon our work. As developers, our task is not just to solve today's problems but also to ensure we do not become tomorrow's problem. Good code, therefore, is not just a love letter, but it is our lasting legacy to those who follow us.

**Ten Years of “Go: The Good, the Bad, and the Meh”**  
https://blog.carlmjohnson.net/post/2023/ten-years-of-go-good-bad-meh/  
Ten years ago, I wrote Go: The Good, the Bad, and the Meh. Way back in 2013, it made it to the front page of Hacker News and got over 400 comments on /r/programming. I don’t have analytics from back then, but I suspect it’s one of my more discussed pieces of writing, and it was definitely one of my first experiences of getting a lot of feedback for my writing. (Then again, I don’t have any evidence of whether John Carmack read it, so maybe it’s not the one for my obituary.)

**A developer’s guide to prompt engineering and LLMs**  
https://github.blog/2023-07-17-prompt-engineering-guide-generative-ai-llms/  
Prompt engineering is the art of communicating with a generative AI model. In this article, we’ll cover how we approach prompt engineering at GitHub, and how you can use it to build your own LLM-based application. Releated:

**WebGPU: the cross-platform graphics API of tomorrow**  
https://developer.chrome.com/en/blog/webgpu-cross-platform/  
For web developers, WebGPU is a web graphics API that provides a unified and fast access to GPUs by exposing modern hardware capabilities and allowing rendering and computation operations on a GPU, similar to Direct3D 12, Metal, and Vulkan.

**HTTP has become the default, universal communication protocol**  
https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/tech/HTTPUniversalDefaultProtocol  
In my view, the reason that people see HTTP as the default communication protocol and why so many things use it this way is simple; it works well enough and it's there. Because web servers have become common, pretty much every modern programming environment will have HTTP clients and simple servers in their more or less standard libraries. 

**Useful functions for a HTTP server**  
https://jollytoad.deno.dev/blog/http_fns  
The Deno HTTP server takes a simple Request -> Response handler function, so why not embrace this and compose your handler from more functions. I started building up some simple functions to handle routing, and it eventually grew into quite a collection. Releated: [Fresh 1.3 – Simplified Route Components and More](https://deno.com/blog/fresh-1.3).  

**5 Inconvenient Truths about TypeScript**  
https://oida.dev/5-truths-about-typescript/  
I’m writing books about TypeScript and I do workshops and trainings online and in-house. Every time I meet a new group of developers there are some TypeScript facts that they need to be confronted with. Releated: [Is TypeScript good?](https://rachsmith.com/is-typescript-good/)

**Bringing HDR video to Reels**  
https://engineering.fb.com/2023/07/17/video-engineering/hdr-video-reels-meta/  
Meta has made it possible for people to upload high dynamic range (HDR) videos from their phone’s camera roll to Reels on Facebook and Instagram. To show standard dynamic range (SDR) UI elements and overlays legibly on top of HDR video, we render them at a brightness level comparable to the video itself. We solved various technical challenges to ensure a smooth transition to HDR video across the diverse range of old and new devices that people use to interact with our services every day.

**Replit Storage: The Next Generation**  
https://blog.replit.com/replit-storage-the-next-generation  
Repls today allow 256+ GiB of storage space, up from a historical 1GiB limit. This post is about the infrastructure that enabled that change.

This page is my personal journey to discover Forth and put it in the context of computing history. It is adapted from my slides for a short talk. I've done everything in my power to make this page scale up and down for various screen sizes.

**How the Internet Went to Threads**  
https://www.honest-broker.com/p/how-the-internet-went-to-threads  
Do we really need more social medial platforms? Maybe not, but we definitely deserve better ones—genuine communities that empower users, instead of manipulating them. A little bit of competition in this oligarchic field must be a good thing.

**被空调房偷走的阳气，如何找天补回来？**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/6ke0FjbbMbTrowPJDTxCyA  
生活在大城市的人们，享受着种类最丰富的食品、洁净的水源和充足的医疗卫生资源……但为什么近些年来，城市居民的健康状况有时反而不如农村？其中一个原因就是，城市“偷”走了太阳，也“偷”走了真正的生活。现在的城里人都“蜗居”“蚁居”着，为了能买个“厢房”而拼命，早出晚归，不见太阳。一些房间的阳光被高楼大厦遮挡着；很多北漂族住在地下室和没有窗户的隔板房里……压力和疲劳已经是对自身阳气的损耗，再加上平时生活的环境，人们离太阳似乎越来越远了。

**在浮躁的年代，学一点道家的处世智慧！**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/5xGbLseZNCBd8PVIrTP8GQ  
道家既有指导实际生活的经验性方法、技巧，也有待人接物的理论性原则、价值，更有超越实际生活、追寻心灵自由的超越性境界。但是，长期以来道家处世之道备受误解，如以老子为阴谋论，以庄子为阿Q式“精神胜利法”或避世主义。充分挖掘道家处世之道，不仅有利于探索解决中国传统思想如何适应现代的问题，也有利于现代社会人们深入传统资源寻找解决其自身面临的困境。

**10种教育怪相：教育的边界在哪里？**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/L25qAI8dwXWSqHJl_I-JtA  
教育是一个宏大和长远的话题，注定深系千家万户，关乎很多人的命运。然而由于各种因素，当前教育出现了诸多不符合常理的怪现象，严重制约了教育的良性发展，需要予以解决。
