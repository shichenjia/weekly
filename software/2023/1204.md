Code is a means to an end. Software should have a purpose, it’s supposed to provide a service to some user. It doesn’t matter how well written or maintainable the code is, nor how sophisticated the technology it uses if it doesn’t fulfill its purpose and provides a good experience to the user: user > maintainer > author. Or, since we won’t need to distinguish between developer roles anymore: user > dev. This is why, instead of guessing or asking what they need, it’s best to put the program in front of the users early and frequently and to incorporate what we learn from their feedback.

**从降本增笑到真的降本增效**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/FIOB_Oqefx1oez1iu7AGGg  
最可怕的是，本土大厂讲究人都是可替换的螺丝钉，是35岁就“开采完”的人矿，末位淘汰大裁员也不鲜见。如果 Job Security 成为迫在眉睫的问题，谁还能安下心来踏实做事呢？孟子曰：“君之视臣如手足，则臣视君如腹心；君之视臣如犬马，则臣视君如国人；君之视臣如土芥，则臣视君如寇仇”。这种落后的管理水平才是很多公司真正应该增效的地方。另附：[What Software Developers Can Learn From Big Infrastructure Projects](https://www.simplethread.com/what-software-developers-can-learn-from-big-infrastructure-projects/)。

**You don't need JavaScript for that**  
https://www.htmhell.dev/adventcalendar/2023/2/  
Please don't feel antagonised by the title of this article. I don't hate JavaScript, I love it. I write bucketloads of it every single day. But I also love CSS, and I even love JSX HTML. The reason I love all three of these technologies is something called: The rule of least power.

**Stop building databases**  
https://sqlsync.dev/posts/stop-building-databases/  
So today, I’d like you to join me as we take a look at common application data patterns, and how they relate to database features. Afterwards, we will take a look at an alternative solution to these patterns - a frontend optimized database stack which allows us to focus on the application rather than micromanaging data. Welcome to the world of accidental database programming.

**Web Components Eliminate JavaScript Framework Lock-in**  
https://jakelazaroff.com/words/web-components-eliminate-javascript-framework-lock-in/  
We’ve seen a lot of great posts about web components lately. Many have focused on the burgeoning HTML web components pattern, which eschews shadow DOM in favor of progressively enhancing existing markup. There’s also been discussion — including this post by yours truly — about fully replacing JavaScript frameworks with web components. Those aren’t the only options, though. You can also use web components in tandem with JavaScript frameworks. To that end, I want to talk about a key benefit that I haven’t seen mentioned as much: web components can dramatically loosen the coupling of JavaScript frameworks.

**Psychology of Speed: A Guide to Perceived Performance**  
https://calibreapp.com/blog/perceived-performance  
Happiness score, experience score, or performance score—many have tried to distil people’s experience into a singular number (which, in performance case, has serious downsides). But is it even possible to boil down human perception to a single number? What’s the gap between measured and perceived performance, and which one should we use as our goal?

**Crafting a lightweight markdown editor**  
https://www.ersin.nz/articles/markdown-editor-with-wails-react-tailwind  
Are you tired of dealing with the complexities and massive builds associated with Electron for desktop applications? Do traditional frameworks like QT, GTK, or Win32 make you want to cry? Today we are going to build a markdown editor using Wails, React and Tailwind. Releated: [Marker: Convert PDF to markdown quickly with high accuracy](https://github.com/VikParuchuri/marker).  

**Prettier's CLI: A Performance Deep Dive**  
https://prettier.io/blog/2023/11/30/cli-deep-dive.html  
Hey, I'm Fabio and I've been contracted by the Prettier team to speed up Prettier's command line interface (CLI). In this post we'll take a look at the optimizations I've discovered, the process that lead to finding them, some exciting numbers comparing the current CLI with the new one, and some guesses about what could be optimized next.

**Examples of Great URL Design**  
https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2023/examples-of-great-urls/  
When I reflect on examples of great URL design[1] I’ve encountered through the years — URLs that, when I saw them, I paused and thought “Wow, that’s really neat!” — these are a few that come to mind.

Thanks to the arrival of HDR-VMAF, we were able to optimize our HDR encodes. Fixed-ladder HDR encodes have been fully replaced by optimized ones, reducing storage footprint and Internet data usage — and most importantly, improving the video quality for our members. Improvements have been seen across all device categories ranging from TVs to mobiles and tablets.

## 产品及其它  

**Alternatives To Product Managers**  
https://www.svpg.com/alternatives-to-product-managers/  
I certainly believe that true product managers (not feature-team product managers or product owners) are the most scalable and sustainable solution to driving consistent innovation on behalf of our customers. However, it’s important to realize that you don’t need to have product managers to cover the product management responsibilities.  The responsibilities of value and viability don’t go away, but they can be covered by other qualified people, such as strong product leaders.

**面壁人芒格: 融入现代但对抗现代**  
https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38451278  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/Pl3HyUpRCdYBjr7du6CkjA  
如果还以“投资大师”的身份给芒格写悼词，那在这些人心中，芒格算白活了。很多人把孔子看成落魄文人，皇帝統治的帮凶，中国未能发展出科技的罪魁祸首，但芒格自称是孔子的门徒。原来“温良恭谦让”也可以在现代商业的斗兽场里成功，并不是“只有偏执狂才能生存”。如果仔细观察，仔细体会，你可能会同意，他是带着使命来到这个世界的。芒格把传统的融入现代，而不是很多人以为的，必须要抛弃传统才能拥抱现代。另附：

**多地流感大爆发，如何用药？居家中药指南一文说全**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/3SGACEdhBKsjXwn2aRtpHQ  
最近一段时间，新闻频繁报道“儿科爆满”、“流感高峰”，北京、上海各大儿童医院“一号难求”，到处人流拥挤，连走动都困难。新冠全面放开后，攒了两三年力量的病毒，遇上了两三年没受过锻炼的免疫系统，在秋冬原本告发病毒的季节，便一发不可收拾了。病毒来势汹汹，到底要怎样应对？中医从辨证出发，不管是什么病毒，以「证」对治疗，以下用药方案分享给大家，希望有用，当然更希望用不上。

**堂上双亲你不敬，一心拜神有何用！**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/3S4xNkxOtqq0flxUOQrpDw  
孝顺父母乃世间第一福田，不孝父母，学道或行作一切功德，皆无意义。中华民族是一个有着优秀传统美德的伟大民族，其深厚的文化底蕴和优秀的社会传统，构成了五千年文明的主体结构。而道家是根植于中华沃土上的一个民族宗教，故中华民族的许多优良传统和道德理念也都在道家的经典中传承、体现，而忠孝更是道家中不可或缺的重要内容。欲修仙道，先修人道，天上没有不孝的神仙，所谓先修人道，其核心就是要践行孝道，以达至真忠至孝。
