**How we run projects at Linear**  
https://linear.app/blog/how-we-run-projects-at-linear  
In this interview our product and engineering teams explain how we plan and manage projects in Linear and keep the rest of the company up-to-date on their progress.

**Making a Website is for Everyone**  
https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2023/websites-are-for-normies/  
The web is the only programming platform (that I know of) that considers its builders regular people, not IT Professionals and continues to write standards with that consideration. Over time, the direction of web technology always trends towards complexity. Simplicity is achieved as a concerted, mindful fight against this.

**The Story of Third-party JavaScript**  
https://benv.ca/blog/posts/the-story-of-third-party-javascript  
In this post, I wanted to revisit some of the story behind Third-party JavaScript: where the idea came from, how we came to talk to publishers, the process of writing the book, how it sold, and finally, explore its lasting ramifications. Whether you’re a prospective book author, a third-party scripter, or just curious about JavaScript community history, I hope you’ll find it mildly interesting.

**Simplified Responsive Design Mode**  
https://webkit.org/blog/14670/simplified-responsive-design-mode/  
Creating resilient, adaptive designs requires tools that help you quickly explore your layouts in every resolution. Responsive Design Mode in Safari does just that. It gives you a fast preview of how your web page layout adapts to different viewport dimensions and aspect ratios in real time. As part of the suite of developer tools, Responsive Design Mode is available when you enable Show features for web developers in Safari’s Advanced settings.

**How Wikimedia Balances Security and Open Information in Web Development**  
https://openjsf.org/uncategorized/2023/10/05/wikimedia-case-study/  
Wikimedia’s mission is to bring free educational content to the world. Its global community of volunteers work on a range of free knowledge and open data projects, including Wikipedia. With the support of the non-profit Wikimedia Foundation, they are united by a vision: to bring about a world in which every single human being can freely share in the sum of all knowledge. We talked with Timo Tijhof, Principal Engineer at Wikimedia Foundation, to find out how Wikimedia approaches security and performance at scale. Timo has worked at Wikimedia for over 10 years, first starting as a front-end developer and eventually as a part of the Wikimedia Performance Team. 

**How I Reduced My App's Network Usage by 95%**  
https://blog.scottlogic.com/2023/10/02/how-i-reduced-my-apps-network-usage-by-95-percent.html  
In this blog post we’ll take a brief look at some of the lessons learned while creating a location sharing app for mobile and web. There’s a lot you can do with real-time geolocation data, but I settled on a local exploration app for small groups of friends. 

**An Interactive Intro to CRDTs**  
https://jakelazaroff.com/words/an-interactive-intro-to-crdts/  
In this two-part series, we’ll learn what a CRDT is. Then we’ll write a primitive CRDT, compose it into more complex data structures, and finally use what we’ve learned to build a collaborative pixel art editor. All of this assumes no prior knowledge about CRDTs, and only a rudimentary knowledge of TypeScript.

**Next.js 13 vs Remix: An In-depth case study**  
https://prateeksurana.me/blog/nextjs-13-vs-remix-an-in-depth-case-study/  
This blog post focuses on the lessons I learned, the aspects that one framework should adopt from the other, and my personal experiences and opinions while developing the app in both frameworks. We will be comparing them in different sections, which include Layouts, Data Fetching, Streaming, Data Mutations, Infinite Loading, and some other features.

**Honey, I shrunk the npm package**  
https://jamiemagee.co.uk/blog/honey-i-shrunk-the-npm-package/  
Have you ever wondered what lies beneath the surface of an npm package? At its heart, it’s nothing more than a gzipped tarball. Working in software development, source code and binary artifacts are nearly always shipped as .tar.gz or .tgz files. And gzip compression is supported by every HTTP server and web browser out there. caniuse.com doesn’t even give statistics for support, it just says “supported in effectively all browsers”. But here’s the kicker: gzip is starting to show its age, making way for newer, more modern compression algorithms like Brotli and ZStandard. Now, imagine a world where npm embraces one of these new algorithms. In this blog post, I’ll dive into the realm of compression and explore the possibilities of modernising npm’s compression strategy.

**Retool Workflows is now generally available**  
https://retool.com/blog/workflows-ga/  
Retool Workflows is a visual automation product that lets you compose APIs and database queries with code (JavaScript or Python) to automate work. It combines the ease of drag and drop with the extensibility and reliability of code that engineers need for production-grade work. We’ve also integrated it with the rest of the Retool product so you can extend workflows with user interfaces or vice versa.

**The Absolute Minimum Every Software Developer Must Know About Unicode in 2023**  
https://tonsky.me/blog/unicode/  
A lot has changed in 20 years. In 2003, the main question was: what encoding is this? In 2023, it’s no longer a question: with a 98% probability, it’s UTF-8. Finally! We can stick our heads in the sand again!

**One happy Rails World**  
https://world.hey.com/dhh/one-happy-rails-world-96c46506  
Celebrating twenty years of Ruby on Rails with more than 700 happy developers packed into the coolest conference venue possible in Amsterdam was epic. Safe to say, Rails World was a roaring success. Which is deeply satisfying to conclude, because it really wasn't a given outcome when I started working on The Rails Foundation last year.

**Managing Software at Scale: Kelsey Hightower Talks with Niklas Gustavsson about Fleet Management**  
https://engineering.atspotify.com/2023/10/managing-software-at-scale-googles-kelsey-hightower-talks-with-spotifys-niklas-gustavsson-about-fleet-management/  
How does Spotify manage a sprawling tech ecosystem made up of 500+ squads managing over 10,000 software components in production? Last November, Google Cloud distinguished engineer Kelsey Hightower met with Spotify chief architect Niklas Gustavsson at Spotify’s office in Gothenburg, Sweden, to talk about just that.

道家智慧也说“人能常清净，天地悉皆归”…… 当我们打开《黄帝内经》（放在过去，那可是要先沐浴焚香再打开书呢），铺开纸，拿起笔，深吸一口气，写下第一个字，我们便与圣人的思想开始建立思想链接，在这样的浸润下，我们的神开始归位，我们的身体开始自我疗愈。
