**Kagi Small Web**  
https://blog.kagi.com/small-web  
As a part of our ongoing pursuit to humanize the web, we are pleased to announce the launch of Kagi Small Web. While there is no single definition, “small web” typically refers to the non-commercial part of the web, crafted by individuals to express themselves or share knowledge without seeking any financial gain.

**All the Things That Don’t Make You a Great Software Developer**  
https://spin.atomicobject.com/2023/09/09/great-software-developer/  
The only things every great developer has in common and cannot be great without are:
- Taking pride in the work you do and how you do it.  
- Being humble about your abilities and limitations.  
- Having confidence in your ability to learn and grow.  
- Empathy for other people.  
- Never assuming that just because it runs on your computer, it’ll work in production.

**Open source hooliganism and the TypeScript meltdown**  
https://world.hey.com/dhh/open-source-hooliganism-and-the-typescript-meltdown-a474bfda  
I've seen a lot of true believers argue for virtues of their favorite paradigms and methods over the decades working in software. And mostly, I look at people with a passionate preference and smile. Isn't it great that people care so much about their craft that they volunteer to extol the benefits of their favorite tools! Yes it is, but there's also a fine line between being a passionate evangelist and becoming a dogmatic crusader.

**cola: a text CRDT for real-time collaborative editing**  
https://nomad.foo/blog/cola  
In this blog post I’ll talk about the theoretical background and the technical implementation of cola, a text CRDT for real-time collaborative editing written in Rust. Reading this is not at all necessary to be able to use cola, so if that’s all you’re interested in you can safely skip this post and go straight to the documentation. Releated:

**My Node.js is a bit Rusty**  
https://gal.hagever.com/posts/my-node-js-is-a-bit-rusty  
Replacing an internal Node.js module with a native Rust module made a x25 perf boost. Let’s understand why. 

**An Internet of PHP**  
https://timotijhof.net/posts/2023/an-internet-of-php/  
PHP is big. The trolls can proclaim its all-but-certain “death” until the cows come home, but no amount of heckling changes that the Internet runs on PHP. The evidence is overwhelming. What follows is a loosely organised collection of precisely that evidence.

**How Query Engines Work**  
https://howqueryengineswork.com/  
Since starting my first job in software engineering, I have been fascinated with databases and query languages. It seems almost magical to ask a computer a question and get meaningful data back efficiently. After many years of working as a generalist software developer and an end-user of data technologies, I started working for a startup that threw me into the deep end of distributed database development. This is the book that I wish had existed when I started on this journey. Although this is only an introductory-level book, I hope to demystify how query engines work.

**了解中医，可以避免很多疾病，养生的智慧，从吃开始**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/egCj92KdaORnqq3jp22xUQ  
西医学所看到的病，是用什么来做参照系数呢？是检查指标。不管是感冒还是其他疾病，西医都要通过检查，来确认你到底发生了什么样的病理改变。那么中医看病拿什么来做参照系数呢？是天、地、人，因为中医研究的不是病，而是人的生命规律。

**不产咖啡豆的浙江，为何多“村咖”**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/LwvbV5obpkOconrTx95KVw  
与城市里的忙碌相比，年轻人返乡伴着青山绿水，听着熟悉的乡音，这本就是理想的创业环境。同时，浙江乡村愈加给力的政策，也吸引着年轻人的回流。比如丽水市，在打出“满城咖啡香”的招牌后，明确提出促进咖啡产业发展“三年目标”，真金白银补贴经营户。

**英国前警官给英外交大臣的公开信：说中国是敌人的人，才是敌人**  
https://baijiahao.baidu.com/s?id=1776327885968060251  
让我在中国的外籍人士社区中与众不同的是我在中国骑行3万多公里并接触普通民众。我和妻子看到农村乡镇层面取得的进展，未目睹中国农村发生重大转变的人都无法理解此类成就。正是这种经历也使我成为中国及其执政-党的坚定支持者。我从未见过比中国更强调协作和协商的治理方式——能让民众参与治理并从中受益，这是西方民主支持者无法想象的。

**必须自觉拜人民为师**  
https://baijiahao.baidu.com/s?id=1776328859733308045  
民之所忧，我必念之；民之所盼，我必行之。江山就是人民，人民就是江山。

**毛泽东的奋斗观**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/NotYKpboWbEQdu_M5cvx8g  
“唤起工农千百万，同心干”，表达了毛泽东带领人民艰苦奋斗、团结奋斗、永久奋斗的观点，也表达了毛泽东为人民不怕牺牲、忘我奋斗的品质。奋斗贯穿在毛泽东一生的实践中，也体现在毛泽东的诗词和著述中。另附：
