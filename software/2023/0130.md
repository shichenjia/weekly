**Natural language is the lazy user interface**  
https://austinhenley.com/blog/naturallanguageui.html  
ChatGPT has kicked off a frenzy. It is all anyone in the tech world is talking about it seems. Startups are popping up left and right. Big companies are rapidly releasing ChatGPT-like features integrated in their products. People are anticipating that large language models are going to revolutionize the world. And maybe they will. But a chat bot won't. Expecting users to primarily interact with software in natural language is lazy. It puts all the burden on the user to articulate good questions. What to ask, when to ask it, how to ask it, to make sense of the response, and then to repeat that many times.

**The less JavaScript, the better**

Convert unused JavaScript into lightweight HTML...oh that feels so good.

**You might not need an ORM**  
https://sometechblog.com/posts/you-might-not-need-an-orm/  
I still use Prisma on aihelperbot.com for now but will migrate to Postgres.js in the future when I have some free time. In the meantime I am using raw SQL queries via prisma.$queryRaw in places like the admin dashboard (which essentially is an array of SQL queries that I iterate over and print as HTML). AI has boosted both my productivity and capabilities and wouldn’t want start a new project without it.

**10 Web Development Trends in 2023**  
https://www.robinwieruch.de/web-development-trends/  
In this article, I want to point out new web development trends that I have seen, which are certainly trends which I expect to continue sparking interest among web developers, and which I am excited about for the next year. Let's get right into them ...

**You Will Never Be A Full Stack Developer or, Career Advice For The Working Web Dev**  
https://seldo.com/posts/you-will-never-be-a-full-stack-developer  
I have been thinking a lot about the thing we call "the stack", one of many vague concepts web developers use when describing themselves. People call themselves "frontend", "backend" and "full stack" but there's no real consensus on what any of those mean.

**We actually need more JavaScript frameworks**  
https://whitep4nth3r.com/talks/we-need-more-javascript-frameworks/  
It’s easy to become overwhelmed by the growing number of JavaScript frameworks available today. Believe me, I was. And so I built a tool to help developers choose which JavaScript framework to choose. But it was rubbish. Join me as I share my weird and winding journey through the JavaScript framework landscape. Starting with an overcooked meme, to building a terrible website, and finishing with a call to action, we’ll delve into the lessons I learned along the way, including the importance of asking the right questions about your project before choosing a tech stack and framework.

**Software and its Discontents, Part 2: An Explosion of Complexity**  
https://laughingmeme.org/2023/01/23/software-and-its-discontents-part-2-complexity.html  
This is part 2 in my “Software and its Discontents” series. This series is the product of my asking a bunch of folks about the current state of software engineering, the sense that it is not going well, that people are disillusioned and frustrated. In part 1 I talked a bit about the macro economic trend, namely the end of the decade of cheap money for tech investments, which is driving this conversation, and shaped some of the changes to the industry over the last decade.

**API Evolution Is a Challenge. Could Contract Testing Be the Solution?**

Contract testing has grown in popularity in recent years with the widespread adoption of microservice architectures. In this article, we will share our experiences with contract testing at eBay.

**What I Learned in One Year as an SRE Trainee**  
https://developers.soundcloud.com/blog/sre-trainee  
SRE is an approach that uses software engineering concepts to solve operations problems. Its principles work to align the goals of development and operations to create reliable and scalable systems. In this post, I want to share my experiences as a new SRE. I’ll reflect on the lessons I’ve learned and challenges I’ve faced over the past year. I hope to give you an insight into the role of an SRE, and perhaps even inspire others to consider a career in this field.

**Technical Debt**  
https://architecturenotes.co/technical-debt/  
How does technical debt accrue? Most people would say bad engineering. What is bad engineering? Inflexibility? Is one system engineered correctly to do one thing trying to do something else considered bad engineering?

**Things to do and not to do during a wave of tech layoffs**  
https://christianheilmann.com/2023/01/24/things-to-do-and-not-to-do-during-a-wave-of-tech-layoffs/  
Currently we are in a huge round of tech layoffs that are reminiscent of the first .com crash in the beginning of the century. Meta, Amazon, Microsoft and now Google announced layoffs in the 10k range and it seems no one is spared. New people as well as people who have been at companies for over 20 years all got the meeting we all dread. I also got laid off and I am currently still in negotiations about the details, so there will be a different post on that. This isn’t my first rodeo, and I am in a lead position which is why I get a lot of requests from annoyed and desperate colleagues asking for advice. So here are some things I tell myself right now and others that may be of help if you’re affected or you know someone who is.

**The 10 Best and Worst Decisions I’ve Ever Made**  
https://stonemaiergames.com/the-10-best-and-worst-decisions-ive-ever-made/  
I turned 42 a few weeks ago. Ever since then, I’ve been reflecting on my life so far and how I’d like to use those experiences to grow, learn, and improve over the next 42 years (or however long I have). This started out as a list of mistakes and regrets–let’s face it, I’ve said and done plenty of dumb things over the years–but as I populated the list, I realized that there are more decisions that I’m happy with, particularly in terms of the impact on me and the people around me.

**我们应该如何认识生命？**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/P0ePtYud5361m7ydoSNjnw  
我们对于生命应该拥有一个什么样的认识呢？首先，生命的存在不仅仅是这个我们能够看得见摸得着的肉体。如果稍稍详尽一些，那么生命实际涵括三个层面，亦即所谓的“三才”。其一，就是上面的肉体层面（形）；其二，是心的层面；其三，是性的层面。性是生命的根本层面，也是最深、最里、最原始（或最本真）的层面，这个层面在《中庸》里又称为“天命”。孔子“五十而知天命”，就是已经体证到了生命的这个层面。肉体或者身（形）是生命可以被触及的层面，也可以说是生命的表层。那么，介于表里之间的这一层，便可称之为“心”。心是表里内外之间的枢机，根本层面必须通过心才能作用到身体，而要想透过身体去触及生命的本源——性，唯一的路径也只有心。另附：[生活本身才是真正的养料](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/xuGfJPBYAujaCLqcmlUPpg)、[读懂“上善若水”，领悟人生高度！](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/7UEoxBblayJoJlIHvG7TEQ)。
