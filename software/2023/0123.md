**History of Web Browser Engines from 1990 until today**  
https://eylenburg.github.io/browser_engines.htm  
The loss of browser diversity since the rise of Chromium has been greatly lamented. Below you can find a graph that shows the historical and present browser engines (not browsers, but the HTML rendering engines), as well as from when to when they were developed. For the bigger engines, the market share is indicated by a coloured shape (see legend).

**The Page With No Code**  
https://danq.me/2023/01/11/nocode/  
It all started when I saw no-ht.ml, Terence Eden‘s hilarious response to Salma Alam-Naylor‘s excellent HTML is all you need to make a website. The latter is an argument against both the silly amount of JavaScript with which websites routinely burden their users, but also even against depending on CSS. As a fan of CSS Naked Day and a firm believer in using JS only for progressive enhancement, I’m obviously in favour.

**Libre Arts - 2023 in preview**  
https://librearts.org/2023/01/year-in-preview/  
What's coming this year across the entire stack of free software for creatives. Releated: [Unpacking the value of open source and code collaboration](https://github.blog/2023-01-20-unpacking-the-value-of-open-source-and-code-collaboration/).

**Introducing the WebAssembly JavaScript Promise Integration API**  
https://v8.dev/blog/jspi  
The JavaScript Promise Integration (JSPI) API allows WebAssembly applications that were written assuming that access to external functionality was synchronous to operate smoothly in an environment where much of the desired functionality is asynchronous.

**The pain points of teaching computer science**  
https://austinhenley.com/blog/teachingpainpoints.html  
Teaching is hard. But exactly what about it is hard? How could technology help? To investigate the pain points that CS instructors face and their workarounds, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 32 computer science instructors. Their institutions range from large research universities to small liberal arts colleges and community colleges across 7 different countries.

**又一次全栈，是工程师至暗时刻还是新机会？**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/mFbE_CGJJauioxAvs5OO7Q  
每年都会做一次年度总结和趋势预测，以往我对前端趋势都是比较乐观的，但在今年，此时此景，我竟然有一种莫名的惆怅，因为今年可能是至今为止变化最大的一年。对应标题中的全栈，可能大家都熟悉，但今天我要讲的是“又一次全栈”，低码全栈，是我以为的未来发展趋势。在当前前端成熟度和技术突破的结果上，催生低码全栈，继而导致工程师角色的变化，可能是前端的至暗时刻，也可能是新的机会。本文主要探讨这个问题，相信能够给大家一些不一样的输入

**Who Owns the Generative AI Platform?**  
https://a16z.com/2023/01/19/who-owns-the-generative-ai-platform/  
We’re starting to see the very early stages of a tech stack emerge in generative artificial intelligence (AI). Hundreds of new startups are rushing into the market to develop foundation models, build AI-native apps, and stand up infrastructure/tooling. Many hot technology trends get over-hyped far before the market catches up. But the generative AI boom has been accompanied by real gains in real markets, and real traction from real companies.

**The Paradox of Goals**  
https://nesslabs.com/the-paradox-of-goals  
The Internet and our bookshelves are filled with exhortations to stay motivated, manage our time more effectively, and stick to our plan. If success is so easy to define, why is it then that we often struggle to establish, pursue, and reach our goals? The way we manage goals is broken, to the point where many people are questioning the very nature of ambition. And it is true that chasing ambitious goals may feel pointless when everything feels so chaotic.

今天是虎年的最后一期推送，每每遇见这类颇有意义的时间节点（DNA游民们不能按时交稿的时候），编辑就会想要（不得不）做些不一样的内容。我找到11位已经离开DNA的游民，问了他们三个很临时很草率很没有技术含量问题：你在DNA生活了多久？离开DNA后去了哪里？2023年的打算？总计收到10份回答。关于这三个问题，有人只言片语，有人滔滔不绝，在此都依照他们的情绪一一记录下来。

**毛泽东过春节，从来不虚度**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/ojWG8Hm7jFvy4R2x0-BQeg  
在仔细翻阅了各类有关毛主席的权威传记、年谱及其他相关的资料文献后，我惊讶地发现：毛泽东过春节，从来不虚度。不管是早年求学、探索，还是后来投身革命，参与斗争，在本该好好休息放松、阖家团圆的日子里，毛主席似乎始终未曾松懈，而是紧紧抓住宝贵的时间，努力奋斗。努力为什么而奋斗？为个人成长而奋斗，为社会改造而奋斗，为中国革命而奋斗，为人民群众而奋斗。
