**Recapturing early-internet whimsy with HTML**  
https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/12/21/1084525/internet-whimsy-html-energy/  
Modern forms of coding make most websites feel like commercial transactions. The HTML Energy movement aims to bring back the joys of the early days. Releated: [The "Cheap" Web](https://potato.cheap/), [Launching Epic Web](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/launching-epic-web).  

**ONCE #1 is entirely #nobuild for the front-end**

I don’t even mind having had to travel a long way to get here. I did webpack, I’ve done esbuild, I’ve done all of it along the way. But I’m a firm believer that complexity ought to be a temporary price we pay for progress. The final destination, for me, has always been simplicity. And nothing is simpler than sending a plain-text JavaScript or CSS file straight to a browser and watch the magic play.

**All code is technical debt**

As developers, it’s tempting to think we’re creating value by writing code. However, the value of software comes from the usefulness of it to users, not the quality of our code. Poorly written code that does a useful task is more valuable than beautifully implemented code that does a useless one. Because of this, we need to ensure we’re working on valuable features. While traditionally development processes have assumed an omnipotent product owner, who somehow knows the relative value of features, that isn’t really the case.

**10 Things Software Developers Should Learn about Learning**  
https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2024/1/278891-10-things-software-developers-should-learn-about-learning/fulltext 
Learning is necessary for software developers. Change is perpetual: New technologies are frequently invented, and old technologies are repeatedly updated. Thus, developers do not learn to program just once—over the course of their careers they will learn many new programming languages and frameworks. Releated:

**How it’s Made: Interacting with Gemini through multimodal prompting**  
https://developers.googleblog.com/2023/12/how-its-made-gemini-multimodal-prompting.html  
In this post, we’ll explore some of the prompting approaches we used in our Hands on with Gemini demo video. We’ll soon be rolling out Gemini for people to try in Google AI Studio, our free, web-based developer tool where you’ll be able to try your own multimodal prompts with Gemini. We’re hoping this guide of starter prompts and ideas helps inspire you to start exploring your own ideas. Releated:

A huge amount of infrastructure goes into serving Threads. But, because of space limitations, we will only give examples of two existing components that played an important role: ZippyDB, our distributed key/value datastore, and Async, our aptly named asynchronous serverless function platform.

**Alternate Futures for “Web Components”**  
https://blog.carlana.net/post/2023/web-component-alternative-futures/  
It seems like Web Components are always just on the cusp of finally catching on. They’re like the year of Linux on the desktop for frontend nerds. I keep reading the latest articles about Web Components as they bubble up on my social media feeds, just hoping that there is something that I missed out on and now they have more substance, but I always end up feeling disappointed.

**开源价值观：人类文明演进如何与现代商业共融**  
https://new.qq.com/rain/a/20231222A01YYZ00  
价值观是指导人类行为的底层逻辑。开源的价值观，其内涵包括奉献、感恩、开放、勇敢、追求持续进步，以及按照劳动获得公平价值回报六个方面。乍看起来，这一价值理念似乎映衬亚里士多德的美德论。而事实上，其兴起的源动力是人类对于个体认知和群体协作的底层诉求。那么，企业作为开源的主导发起者，同时也是市场经济的主要参与者，应该如何深入理解开源的价值观？如何将其与现代商业价值进行逻辑共融？进一步，如何践行开源理念？

**More product, fewer PMs**  
https://kitemaker.co/blog/more_product_fewer_pms  
Michael Seibel's article “Guide to product development” illustrates how this was implemented at Social Cam. Fundamentally, it means the team must actively share context and reasoning, ensuring that design and engineering have access to user feedback. Problem-solving should not be done primarily by the PM; instead, it should be a collaborative effort involving product, design, and engineering teams.

**Product Predictions 2024**  
https://www.svpg.com/product-predictions-2024/  
Recently I was invited by Productboard to give a talk on the topic of what 2024 might have in store for the product community.  If you prefer to watch a video (60 min), you can find the recording here.  But in this article I thought I’d share my thoughts in narrative form.

**值得学会的常用急救方法**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/TxT-o1ChrnIF2P8DmEu_Lg  
朋友在医院的这些做法也许不大合规，但在不影响医院抢救工作的同时，为家人做一些力所能及的辅助手法，也是情理之中。也许我们无法逆转生命的走向，但是可以用我们内心的美好，让生命的状态尽可能变得更好一些，再好一些。尤其在遇到一些危险情况时，至少不会手足无措、束手无策，而是能尽心尽力去做些什么，哪怕只是一点点。
