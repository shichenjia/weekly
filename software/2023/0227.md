**The age of cargo cult Agile must end**  
https://jchyip.medium.com/the-age-of-cargo-cult-agile-must-end-9408e1d13e1d  
https://uxdesign.cc/the-age-of-agile-must-end-bc89c0f084b7  
At first, I thought “The age of Agile must end” was an example of the cargo cult reinvention cycle but looking more closely, it seems like it’s both a cargo cult understanding of Agile AND arguing for something that is not aligned with Agile. I don’t necessarily think this was an intentional straw man argument though.

**丛林中的门铃：将 “运气” 最大化的一种商业模式**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/BWjDxLA8V_M_wlfnZCGc4Q  
多数管理者都依赖于数字作出决定。数字越详细他们的建模越可靠，然后决策成功率就越高，亦可调动更多资源来投入。这种垂直思考的是大多数人的默认值，给人以具体的确定感觉，并且这样「程序正义」，即使是失败了也有情可原，虽然很难有巨大的回报，但及格是没问题的。而文中所说丛林中的门铃，是一种水平思考的方法。放弃了具体的、特定的预先计划的想法，而是专注于对于过程中的反应。水平思考的方法看似松散，也不严肃，看起来像是运气，但其实可以不断增加运气的表面积（如低成本放置更多门铃）。

**研究《毛选》，悟透成长：“方向”的奥义**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/SLZczmFB5c8HMfEEnEpWOg  
定位是一个向心力，让你可以长期在一个方向上持续用力。思考、读书、交际，时间、精力，都聚焦在这个方向上深耕。这就能够让你牢牢占据一个生态位，拥有一定的垄断程度。不然，何时何地都是普工，都要被社会碾压。这就是战略，就是出类拔萃。做正确的事，比正确的做事更重要。

**大智阴中用阳**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/Ogh32XnmPBbIy-ul_9y2OQ  
得阳者生，得阴者寿，很多人都没意识到，“生”与“寿”其实是两个课题，就像做大做强和基业长青是两个课题，需要分别做足功课。而世人多只关心阳而背离阴，“夭”也就成了一种宿命，如世间那些不断涌现的昙花一现，且不乏反噬。真正的智者，则一开始就懂得阴中用阳的道理，一开始就会考虑个既把事情做好，也要做得长久。
