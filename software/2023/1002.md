Enabled by WebAssembly + Emscripten, Web Components + Lit, Service Workers + Workbox & new Web APIs. Chrome & Adobe enjoyed collaborating on it.

**The Saga of the Closure Compiler, and Why TypeScript Won**  
https://effectivetypescript.com/2023/09/27/closure-compiler/  
Here's something that makes me feel old: in just six months, Gmail will celebrate its 20th anniversary. If you weren't actively developing web sites at the time, it's hard to capture just how revolutionary it was. This was a time when JavaScript was held in almost universally low regard. The idea that you could build a sophisticated web app using it was mind-boggling. But it clearly worked and it heralded the dawn of the single-page web app (SPA).

**Speeding up the JavaScript ecosystem - Polyfills gone rogue**  
https://marvinh.dev/blog/speeding-up-javascript-ecosystem-part-6/  
Many popular npm packages depend on 6-8x more packages than they need to. Most of these are unnecessary polyfills and it's one of the key reasons node_modules folders are so large. The eslint ecosystem seems to be most affected by this.

**Questions to Help Your Software Team Create Clarity, Reduce Stress**  
https://spin.atomicobject.com/2023/09/30/questions-create-clarity/  
As software consultants, we work with widely varying degrees of direction. Sometimes we pick up well-defined tasks, like the best, clearest stories in our development backlog or direct requests for information from our clients. Other times, we have to work harder to create the clarity we need to succeed. And, it can feel stressful if you’re expecting a high degree of clarity and receive the opposite. I’ve found a few simple questions invaluable in helping my teams work through situations where a high degree of unexpected uncertainty is blocking a task.

**Why embracing complexity is the real challenge in software today**  
https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/09/29/1080282/why-embracing-complexity-is-the-real-challenge-in-software-today/  
In the midst of industry discussions about productivity and automation, it’s all too easy to overlook the importance of properly reckoning with complexity.

**Meet Angular’s New Control Flow**  
https://blog.angular.io/meet-angulars-new-control-flow-a02c6eee7843  
This November, we’ll release Angular version 17 with a number of new template features, including a new built-in syntax for control flow and deferrable views. The new declarative control flow brings the functionality of NgIf, NgFor, and NgSwitch into the framework itself, and deferrable views allows templates to load dependencies lazily, in response to one or more configurable trigger conditions.

**Why HTTP/3 is eating the world**  
https://blog.apnic.net/2023/09/25/why-http-3-is-eating-the-world/  
Last year a new version of the protocol, HTTP/3, was standardized by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), the organization in charge of defining Internet technologies. Since then, HTTP/3 and the related QUIC protocol have seen a rapid uptake on the public web. The exact numbers depend on the source and measurement methodology, with HTTP/3 support ranging from 19% to 50+% of web servers and networks worldwide.

**Why multi-page apps?**  
https://gomakethings.com/why-multi-page-apps/  
There are absolutely use-cases for SPAs (media sites, primarily). Most of the other things we use them for make the user experience notably worse or band-aid over the real underlying issues without addressing them.

**Best Practices for Developing Complex Form-Based Apps with React Hook Form and TypeScript Support**  
https://orizens.com/blog/best_practices_for_developing_complex_form-based_apps_with_react_hook_form_and_typescript_support/  
In this follow-up exploration, I’m excited to share the culmination of my experiences and discoveries. We’ll dive into a set of best practices that have proven to be invaluable when dealing with the challenges of developing extensive form-based apps using React Hook Form, and we’ll emphasize the added benefits of incorporating TypeScript for enhanced type safety and developer productivity. 

**My thoughts on Svelte 5 as a full-time Svelte Developer for 3+ years**  
https://poxi.substack.com/p/my-thoughts-on-svelte-5-as-a-full  
As a full-time Svelte user for three years, I've built a real-time collaborative website builder with 10 000+ users. My solo success wouldn't have been possible without Svelte, and here's my take on the latest sneak peek of Svelte 5.

**How GitHub uses GitHub Actions and Actions larger runners to build and test GitHub.com**  
https://github.blog/2023-09-26-how-github-uses-github-actions-and-actions-larger-runners-to-build-and-test-github-com/  
Recently, we’ve been working to make our CI experience better by leveraging the newly released GitHub feature, Actions larger runners, to run our CI.

**Welcome to the low-modeling revolution**  
https://modeling-languages.com/welcome-to-the-low-modeling-revolution/  
This forces us to define new types of models and languages to be able to express all these requirements and features and new low-code platforms to be able to transform those models in running code. But this comes with a price, the software models themselves keep growing both in terms of size and in terms of the number of perspectives they need to cover. It is not just static and behavioral aspects. It’s also machine learning components, natural language interfaces, energy consumption,… and all the relationships among all these models. In what follows, I propose low-modeling as a solution. 

**ChatGPT, Bard, or Bing Chat? Differences Among 3 Generative-AI Bots**  
https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ai-bot-comparison/  
Participants rated Bing Chat as less helpful and trustworthy than ChatGPT or Bard. These results can be attributed to Bing’s richer yet imperfect UI and to its poorer information aggregation. Releated:

**诺娜：这是一门灵魂与灵魂交汇的针法**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/6DkUTLS9RmSUZXT-RnDu5Q  
在五行针灸里面，我们强调治疗师和病人之间神与神、灵魂与灵魂的交汇，这样一门针法于现在是非常稀缺的。大家都知道，我们去医院的话，医生和病人之间隔着一张桌子、一台电脑，这是个普遍的现象。但在五行针灸里面，我们要求治疗师和病人之间是灵魂与灵魂交汇的这样一种状态。

**王毅：教育的目的是向人传送生命的气息**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/aiinzVYPpBYQKs_BN0PXUQ  
教育的使命是什么？印度诗人泰戈尔说：“教育的目的应当是向人传送生命的气息。”用柏拉图的话说：“教育就是心灵转向，从低处转向高处，从虚假转向真实，从黑暗转向光明，从冷漠转向热心。”根据柏拉图的观点，如果一个人的内心关注的是高处、真实处、光明处，他就算受过真正的教育、好的教育。《大学》说：“大学之道，在明明德，在亲民，在止于至善。”真正的教育是对至善的不懈追求，不断地净化灵魂。
