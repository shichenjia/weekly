**The Worst Programmer I Know**  
https://dannorth.net/2023/09/02/the-worst-programmer/  
The great thing about measuring developer productivity is that you can quickly identify the bad programmers. I want to tell you about the worst programmer I know, and why I fought to keep him in the team.

**I Reviewed 1,000s of Opinions on Serverless**  
https://konfigthis.com/blog/serverless  
No technology is a silver bullet, and serverless is no exception. Every technological decision is about choosing the right tool for the job. Serverless has some distinct trade-offs that need to be understood before it's adopted. Whenever you hear someone criticize serverless, be wary of the problems they encountered. Were they design problems? Were there clear misuses of serverless? Serverless is not a panacea.

**Build a Cross-Platform CLI with Deno in 5 minutes**  
https://deno.com/blog/build-cross-platform-cli  
Command line interfaces (“CLI”) are useful, simple to use, and in many cases, the fastest way to get something done. While there are many ways to build a CLI, Deno’s zero config, all-in-one modern tooling, ability to compile your script to a portable executable binary, makes building CLIs a breeze.

**How Radix Build Low Level Components**  
https://alexkondov.com/how-radix-build-low-level-components/  
A few years ago, keeping up with the JS ecosystem was my part-time job. I’d spend weekends trying out libraries and staying informed about what bug the latest minor version of each one fixed. Now I hardly have the time to do that, so I wait until a library starts making the rounds on Twitter (X?) before I spend some time with it. This time, it was Radix’s Primitives that surfaced.

**The Ideal Viewport Doesn’t Exist**  
https://viewports.fyi/  
Here at Set Studio, we conducted a little casual experiment to answer “how fragmented are viewport sizes?”. We gathered over 120,000 datapoints with over 2,300 unique viewport sizes. The data mainly came from users in the USA and Europe, therefore it is not necessarily representative of a global audience, but still useful for this article.

Rust continues to top the charts as the most admired and desired language by developers, and in this post, we dive a little deeper into how (and why) Rust is stealing the hearts of developers around the world. Releated: [Fomos: Experimental OS, built with rust](https://github.com/Ruddle/Fomos).

**The end of the Googleverse**  
https://www.theverge.com/23846048/google-search-memes-images-pagerank-altavista-seo-keywords  
For two decades, Google Search was the invisible force that determined the ebb and flow of online content. Now, for the first time, its cultural relevance is in question.

**What do I think about Community Notes?**  
https://vitalik.ca/general/2023/08/16/communitynotes.html  
Community Notes is a fact-checking tool that sometimes attaches context notes, like the one on Elon's tweet above, to tweets as a fact-checking and anti-misinformation tool. It was originally called Birdwatch, and was first rolled out as a pilot project in January 2021. Since then, it has expanded in stages, with the most rapid phase of its expansion coinciding with Twitter's takeover by Elon last year. Today, Community Notes appear frequently on tweets that get a very large audience on Twitter, including those on contentious political topics. 

**子午流注：神奇的时间医学，要健康每天就该这样过！**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/Pg1Q541t1Va1oy1ZDBxxFA  
子午是指时辰，流是流动，注是灌注。子午流注理论，是将一天24小时划分为12个时辰，对应十二地支，与人体十二脏腑的气血运行结合，在一天12时辰之中，人体的气血首尾相衔的循环流注，盛衰开合均有时间节奏、时相特性。

**这本书中有我的灵魂 | 《灵魂守护者》序言**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/nNdlu0yfCsgaOgCG76prjQ  
这本书是我对中国古人的致敬，他们数千年前揭示的真理在当世仍然普适。五行针灸是一门极具灵性的针法，这本书里有我对五行针灸之美最深的思考。“道”是宇宙的灵魂，我相信五行是无所不包的“道”的代码，也是人类每个灵魂的守护者。我至今仍对此生能够成为一名五行针灸师深感荣幸，希望读者在看完本书后会理解我的感受。

**教员是如何看待日本的？**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/hgbGbbPm9A5EtoYWbo6rPA  
在反对日本排放核污水这件事上，我们要把日本人区别开来，不能因为日本人这个统称，就要把所有日本人一棍子打死。我们的敌人是日本政府、东电公司以及支持核污水排海的美国，不是所有日本人民。矛头要对准真正的敌人。历史的经验证明，情绪高涨的时候，进行无差别攻击是不能解决问题的，冷静下来分析问题，抓住主要矛盾才有可能解决问题。
