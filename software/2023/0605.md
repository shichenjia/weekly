**Generative Language Models: Are modelers ready for ChatGPT and what is to come?**  
https://modeling-languages.com/generative-language-models-are-modelers-ready/  
After the release of powerful Large Language Models (LLM) such as Copilot and ChatGPT, many of us were wondering whether indeed they are good at, not only coding, but modeling. There seem to be a good number of engineers believing that LLM came to stay and that they are going to revolutionize the way in which software is developed, but: Up to what extend can LLMs be used today to model software systems? While there are many papers devoted to analyzing the potential advantages and limitations of these generative AI models for writing code, the analysis of the current state of LLMs with respect to software modeling has received little attention so far.

**Future-first design thinking**  
https://www.wholegraindigital.com/blog/future-first-design-thinking/  
Design is a powerful tool that goes beyond aesthetics. It encompasses the creation of systems that work better, providing nurturing environments for both people and the planet. While design is often associated with visual appeal, its impact extends far beyond appearances. In this blog, we will explore how design can contribute to a sustainable future, emphasising the importance of considering form, function and the well-being of our environment.

**I tried 8 different Postgres ORMs**  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QN1BzxF8wM  
Let's compare 8 ways to work with SQL databases in a JavaScript project like Node.js or Next.js. Analyze the pros and cons of libraries and ORMs that can run Postgres queries in a fullstack framework. 

**300ms Faster: Reducing Wikipedia's Total Blocking Time**  
https://www.nray.dev/blog/300ms-faster-reducing-wikipedias-total-blocking-time/  
For more than three years, Wikipedia’s mobile site suffered from a piece of JavaScript that could take over 600ms to execute during page load on low-end devices, effectively blocking user interactions. In this article, we’ll walk through a couple of easy steps I took to reduce the execution time of this task by about 50%.

**Applying GitOps principles to your operations**

Could we use our Git repository as the source of truth for operational tasks, and somehow reconcile changes with our real-world view?

**Implementing a distributed key-value store on top of implementing Raft in Go**  
https://notes.eatonphil.com/2023-05-25-raft.html  
s part of bringing myself up-to-speed after joining TigerBeetle, I wanted some background on how distributed consensus and replicated state machines protocols work. TigerBeetle uses Viewstamped Replication. But I wanted to understand all popular protocols and I decided to start with Raft. We'll implement two key components of Raft in this post (leader election and log replication). Around 1k lines of Go. It took me around 7 months of sporadic studying to come to (what I hope is) an understanding of the basics.

**Notes apps are where ideas go to die. And that’s good.**  
https://www.reproof.app/blog/notes-apps-help-us-forget  
https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36136179  
Evernote to OneNote, Moleskins to Field Notes, Roam to Obsidian. We blame the tools, the techniques. Surely they’re to blame. A new app will be better. Then we dump our newest thoughts into it, try the latest features to organize notes, until we’re back to safely forgetting things. Then the illusion gets shattered again, and we’re on to the next new thing. Yet maybe the apps worked all along by letting us forget. We didn’t need bookmarks and notes as much as we needed the safety of letting go. Anywhere we could save our thoughts was enough.

**用 8 年时间建了 4 所公益学校，这是我做的最好的一笔投资**  
https://youzhiyouxing.cn/n/materials/1461  
这次六一儿童节，我们把目光从城市转向了田间乡野，把眼光放在了困难儿童身上。我们请到了公益学校苦志育才的创始人黄先生。这是一所专门救助困境儿童的九年一贯制学校。2020 年，孟岩把自己全年公众号的打赏捐给了这所学校，并且在这之后的几年时间里一直如此。那时候，苦志育才刚好办了一场办学经验分享会，我很好奇这是一家怎样的公益学校，于是和另一个有知有行小伙伴去实地走访，并写下了我的观察。这场拜访让我对那里的孩子留下了很深的印象，也是我第一次体会到，原来有人能把公益做得像开公司一样，完全运用商业化的思维办学校。在创始人黄先生看来，做公益和系统升级一样，1.0 版本是捐款捐物，2.0 版本是单点救助，3.0的版本是如何用商业化的方式系统解决困境儿童的教育问题，为此，他们进行了八年的持续探索。

**大道不离目前，离开目前谈玄论道就是背道而驰.....**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/mXvfZc2W6zGnKnRoV6Hn5Q  
师父很少跟我们讲什么人生大道理，他就是做给你看。有一个道友在玉蟾宫和老道长生活了一个月，然后很奇怪地问：道爷，你怎么都不修行啊？师父后来跟我们说，很多人以为打坐念经才是修行，那才高级。他们不知道其实吃饭睡觉扫地修路才是大修行。“要先学做好人，认真吃饭睡觉。人都做不好，谈什么修神仙.....”师父认认真真地刮着碗底说，“大道不离目前，离开目前谈玄论道就是背道而驰......”

中华优秀传统文化是我们党创新理论的“根”。只有植根本国、本民族历史文化沃土，马克思主义真理之树才能根深叶茂。习近平总书记深刻指出，“马克思主义传入中国后，科学社会主义的主张受到中国人民热烈欢迎，并最终扎根中国大地、开花结果，决不是偶然的，而是同我国传承了几千年的优秀历史文化和广大人民日用而不觉的价值观念融通的”，强调要“去挖掘、去结合中华优秀传统文化，真正实现马克思主义中国化时代化”。
