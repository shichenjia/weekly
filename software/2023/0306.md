**You Don't Need a Build Step**  
https://deno.com/blog/you-dont-need-a-build-step  
Today, the web developer version would be "my site's building" and they would be playing swords in VR. Sites take time to build these days. A large Next.js 11 site will take several minutes to build. This is wasted time in the development cycle. Build tools like Vite or Turbopack highlight their ability to get this number down. But the deeper question hasn't been considered: Why do we even need a build step? Releated: [All you may need is HTML](https://fabiensanglard.net/html/index.html).

**Could we make the web more immersive using a simple optical illusion?**  
https://shopify.github.io/spatial-commerce-projects/WonkaVision/  
In the history of mind-blowing tech demos there is one that stands out, and that is Johnny Lee’s Wii Remote hack to create VR displays. We were also curious about whether we could implement his technique in the browser using only a webcam. We thought that if that was possible, it would make his technique accessible to everyone and it would open up a whole new world of interactive experiences on the web.

But what really attracted me to Beck's vision of software development was the irreverent insistence on practicality. There was plenty of vision, plenty of principles, but they all lead to running code. In the battle for software development's soul, Beck was formulating the war cry for a rebel army tired of going in circles from commands up high.

**The lone developer problem**  
https://evanhahn.com/the-lone-developer-problem/  
In short: in my experience, if a single programmer builds something, it’s often hard for others to maintain later. There are several possible reasons why. Even great programmers fall into this trap!
