We’ve created GPT-4, the latest milestone in OpenAI’s effort in scaling up deep learning. GPT-4 is a large multimodal model (accepting image and text inputs, emitting text outputs) that, while less capable than humans in many real-world scenarios, exhibits human-level performance on various professional and academic benchmarks.

**Serverless in 2023**  
https://blog.symphonia.io/posts/2023-03-15_serverless-2023  
Overall I'm still happy with the trajectory of Serverless eight years after I first used it. More companies are embracing it, more engineers are learning it, and the capabilities of Serverless services grow by the month.

**Making it easier to contribute to Servo**  
https://servo.org/blog/2023/03/16/making-easier-to-contribute/  
Back in January, flaky tests were a serious problem for Servo’s development. Each build failure caused by flaky tests would delay merging a pull request by over two hours, and some changes took as many as seven tries to merge! But since then, we’ve made a bunch of improvements to how we run tests, which should make contributing to Servo a lot easier.

**Switching From C++ to Rust**  
https://laplab.me/posts/switching-from-cpp-to-rust/  
Altogether, Rust feels like a major improvement for my day-to-day developer experience. The tooling is friendly and helpful, the language is expressive and powerful. I really enjoy it and hope it will avoid some of the C++ pitfalls in the future.

**Update on Meta’s Year of Efficiency**  
https://about.fb.com/news/2023/03/mark-zuckerberg-meta-year-of-efficiency/  
Our efficiency work has several parallel workstreams to improve organizational efficiency, dramatically increase developer productivity and tooling, optimize distributed work, garbage collect unnecessary processes, and more. I’ve tried to be open about all the work that’s underway, and while I know many of you are energized by this, I also recognize that the idea of upcoming org changes creates uncertainty and stress. My hope is to make these org changes as soon as possible in the year so we can get past this period of uncertainty and focus on the critical work ahead.

**南怀瑾先生：中国文化必定产生社会主义**

科技是没有感情的，可是人心百分之九十九都是感情、情绪，所谓理性也常常是为情绪服务的。感情、情绪的陶冶，人格的养成，会不会做人做事，不是科技的范围，而是哲学、宗教、文艺、教育的范围。今天的世界惟科技马首是瞻，人格养成没有了，都是乱的不成器的，教育只是贩卖知识，这是根本乱源，是苦恼之源。只有科学、科技、哲学、宗教、文艺、人格养成教育回归一体，回归本位，均衡发展，才有希望。

学习五行，会加深对人类、人性的认识，它会从生活的方方面面对你的生活给予帮助和提升。实际上在我看来，我觉得五行针灸就是一个真理。在我们每个人身上都有一个独特的五行印记，就仿佛是我们的五行DNA，与生俱来、永不改变。可以用五行的方式来说明为什么我们每个人都和别人不一样，为什么我们那么与众不同，为什么我们每个人都那么独特。其实我们每个人都是五行俱全的，五行创造了我们的五脏六腑，还有我们的经络，每个人都有五行。
