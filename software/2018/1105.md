**React Native - Open Source Roadmap**  
http://facebook.github.io/react-native/blog/2018/11/01/oss-roadmap  
This year, the React Native team has focused on a large scale re-architecture of React Native. As Sophie mentioned in her State of React Native post, we've sketched out a plan to better support the thriving population of React Native users and collaborators outside of Facebook. It's now time to share more details about what we've been working on. Before I do so, I'd like to lay out our long-term vision for React Native in open source. 附：[React Native重构路线图发布](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MjM5MDE0Mjc4MA==&mid=2651010262&idx=2&sn=4c3ac4e023b5bc542affc3b3f2c9a8fe).

**Making Sense of React Hooks**  
https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/making-sense-of-react-hooks-fdbde8803889

Also, note that this post contains my personal opinions and doesn’t necessarily reflect the positions of the React team. 另附：[What and How to Test with Jest and Enzyme](https://djangostars.com/blog/what-and-how-to-test-with-enzyme-and-jest-full-instruction-on-react-component-testing/).  

**An Annotated webpack 4 Config for Frontend Web Development**  
https://nystudio107.com/blog/an-annotated-webpack-4-config-for-frontend-web-development  
As web devel­op­ment becomes more com­plex, we need tool­ing to help us build mod­ern web­sites. Here’s a com­plete real-world pro­duc­tion exam­ple of a sophis­ti­cat­ed web­pack 4 config. Build­ing a mod­ern web­site has become cus­tom appli­ca­tion devel­op­ment. Web­sites are expect­ed to do more than just be mar­ket­ing sites as they take on the func­tion­al­i­ty of tra­di­tion­al apps. Any time a process becomes com­pli­cat­ed, we break it down into man­age­able com­po­nents, and auto­mate the build process with tool­ing. This is the case in whether we are man­u­fac­tur­ing cars, draft­ing legal doc­u­ments, or build­ing websites.

**Splicing HTML’s DNA With CSS Attribute Selectors**  
https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/10/attribute-selectors-splicing-html-dna-css/  
Attribute selectors are magical. They can get you out of sticky problems, help you avoid adding classes and point out some problems in your code. But don’t worry, while attribute selectors are complex and powerful, they’re easy to learn and easy to utilize. In this article, we’ll discuss how they operate and give you some ideas about how to use them.

**富文本编辑器的技术演进之路**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzU0Nzk1MTg5OA==&mid=2247484137&idx=1&sn=8dc25f8de7d359549520c9f198721408  
浏览器提供了两个原生特性：contenteditable、document.execCommand()，contenteditable 特性，可以指定某一容器变成可编辑器区域，即用户可以在容器内直接输入内容，或者删减内容。execCommand API，可以对选中的某一段结构体，执行一个命令，譬如赋予黑体格式。基于以上，可以做出最简单的富文本编辑器。原来富文本编辑器是这么简单？当然不止如此简单！另附：[[译]为数字优先新闻编辑室开发文本编辑器](https://juejin.im/post/5bd90eb051882538a56ec15d).

**You Might Not Need JavaScript**  
http://youmightnotneedjs.com/  
JavaScript is great, and by all means use it, while also being aware that you can build so many functional UI components without the additional dependancy. Maybe you can include a few lines of utility code, or a mixin, and forgo the requirement. If you're only targeting more modern browsers, you might not need anything more than what the browser ships with. We take a look at the power of modern native HTML and CSS as well as some of the syntactic sugar of Sass. Because, you might not need scripts for that task at all!

**Creating a QR Code step by step**  
https://www.nayuki.io/page/creating-a-qr-code-step-by-step

**GraphQL - The Good and the Bad**  
https://scotch.io/tutorials/graphql-the-good-and-the-bad  
GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data. GraphQL provides a complete and understandable description of the data in your API as well as gives clients the power to ask for exactly what they need and nothing more. It makes it easier to evolve APIs over time and enables powerful developer tools. At least that's what we all know it to be. In this post, we'll look at all the wonderful things about GraphQL and also look at the unpopular "not so good" things about it. 另附：[GraphQL Server Design @ Medium](https://medium.engineering/graphql-server-design-medium-34862677b4b8).

**Best Practices for Setting SLOs and SLIs For Modern, Complex Systems**  
https://blog.newrelic.com/engineering/best-practices-for-setting-slos-and-slis-for-modern-complex-systems/  
At New Relic, defining and setting Service Level Indicators (SLIs) and Service Level Objectives (SLOs) is an increasingly important aspect of our site reliability engineering (SRE) practice. It’s not news that SLIs and SLOs are an important part of high-functioning reliability practices, but planning how to apply them within the context of a real-world, complex modern software architecture can be challenging, especially figuring out what to measure and how to measure it. In this post, we’ll use a highly simplified version of New Relic’s architecture to walk you through some concrete, practical examples of how we define and measure SLIs and SLOs for our own modern software platform.

**API Profiling at Pinterest**  
https://medium.com/@Pinterest_Engineering/api-profiling-at-pinterest-6fa9333b4961  
When I walked into Pinterest on the first day of my internship and learned I’d be focusing on profiling the API Gateway service — the core backend service of the Pinterest product — my only thought was “What is profiling?”. Profiling is often shoved aside as a side project or as a lower priority concern, and not one typically taught in my college CS courses. Essentially, the services come first, and profiling of is a far second.

**October 21 post-incident analysis**  
https://blog.github.com/2018-10-30-oct21-post-incident-analysis/  
GitHub experienced an incident that resulted in degraded service for 24 hours and 11 minutes. While portions of our platform were not affected by this incident, multiple internal systems were affected which resulted in our displaying of information that was out of date and inconsistent. Ultimately, no user data was lost; however manual reconciliation for a few seconds of database writes is still in progress. For the majority of the incident, GitHub was also unable to serve webhook events or build and publish GitHub Pages sites. 另附：[Github - Game Off 2018 theme announcement](https://blog.github.com/2018-11-01-game-off-2018-theme-announcement/).

**Why we use Ruby on Rails to build GitLab**

**Why Jupyter is data scientists’ computational notebook of choice**  
https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-07196-1  
For data scientists, Jupyter has emerged as a de facto standard, says Lorena Barba, a mechanical and aeronautical engineer at George Washington University in Washington DC. Mario Jurić, an astronomer at the University of Washington in Seattle who coordinates the LSST’s data-management team, says: “I’ve never seen any migration this fast. It’s just amazing.”

**The differing definitions of “serverless”**  
https://winterwindsoftware.com/serverless-definitions/  
A serverless solution is one where developers are freed up to focus more on application development without needing to worry about provisioning, scaling or maintaining servers (or containers), and whose running costs are proportional to the system’s usage levels.

**A Look at the Design of Lua**  
https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2018/11/232214-a-look-at-the-design-of-lua/fulltext  
Though mainly a procedural language, Lua lends itself to several other paradigms, including object-oriented programming, functional programming, and data-driven programming.5 It also offers good support for data description, in the style of JavaScript and JSON. Data description was indeed one of our main motivations for creating Lua, some years before the appearance of XML and JavaScript. 另附：[A Philosophy of Software Design](http://www.pathsensitive.com/2018/10/book-review-philosophy-of-software.html).

**Your Face Here - Creating illustration guidelines for a more inclusive visual identity**  
https://medium.com/dropbox-design/4-ways-to-show-the-value-of-ux-writing-4369d84a6afd  
One of my career goals is to elevate the quality of illustration in tech. Airbnb’s design brand is a harmony of many disciplines—a chorus of experience and motion design, photography, writing, data visualization, and illustration. When I joined the team in October of 2017, I was given the opportunity to redesign Airbnb’s illustration style as a key component of our core identity system. Here’s how my journey unfolded.

**From URL to Interactive**

**Designing an Enterprise Application**  
https://www.lollypop.design/blog/2018/october/designing-an-enterprise-application/  
Designing an enterprise app is complex and requires stitching hundreds of separate requirements together to produce a product that is functional, assistive and delightful, all at the same time. Though it sounds really easy, in practice it is an extremely gruesome process and every designer that opts to be part of an enterprise app designing process should understand in entirety the commitment, patience, and endless hours it requires.
