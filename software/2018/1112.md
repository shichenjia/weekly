There are no silver bullets to web performance. Simple static pages benefit from being server-rendered with minimal JavaScript. Libraries can provide great value for complex pages when used with care. 另附：[How we made Carousell’s mobile web experience 3x faster](https://medium.com/carousell-insider/how-we-made-carousells-mobile-web-experience-3x-faster-bbb3be93e006)、[Improve Animated GIF Performance With HTML5 Video](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/11/gif-to-video/)、[译-轻松实现 Web 性能优化](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/L1xHLd-gKDsmi0lnSmm6pQ)、.

**Getafix: How Facebook tools learn to fix bugs automatically**

**Programming Paradigms for Dummies: What Every Programmer Should Know**  
https://www.info.ucl.ac.be/~pvr/VanRoyChapter.pdf  
This chapter gives an introduction to all the main programming paradigms, their underlying concepts, and the relationships between them. We give a broad view to help programmers choose the right concepts they need to solve the problems at hand. We give a taxonomy of almost 30 useful programming paradigms and how they are related. Most of them differ only in one or a few concepts, but this can make a world of difference in programming.

**How to Design Software Good**  
https://www.haiku-os.org/docs/HIG/index.xml  
Haiku is an operating system which is known for its speed and being easy for anyone to use. This is partly because good programmers try to design their apps for more than just themselves. We are going to examine how you can also make your program more appealing. The reason is easy: easier to use means more people using your program. Writing good software can be hard, but it is worth the time and effort.

**百度Web前端开发实战案例解析**

**写给自己看的display: grid布局教程**  
https://www.zhangxinxu.com/wordpress/2018/11/display-grid-css-css3/  
在我看来，Grid布局就像是“分田种地”。故事是这样的，张老板是个程序员，省吃俭用攒了点小钱，然后老家因为城镇化建设，农村都没什么人，土地都荒废在那里，于是就承包了一块地，打算养养鱼，种种果树。承包的地方很挺大，如何划分土地就成了问题，于是张老板打算借助Grid布局来划分。另附：[CSS Frameworks Or CSS Grid: What Should I Use For My Project](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/11/css-frameworks-css-grid/)、[How Basecamp Uses CSS Grid in Production](https://xotv.me/channels/22-important/vod_videos/1205-important-slash-slash-basecamp-dot-com-css-grid).

**Beyond console.log()**  
https://medium.com/@mattburgess/beyond-console-log-2400fdf4a9d8  
There is more to debugging JavaScript than console.log to output values. It might seem obvious I’m going to pimp the debugger, but actually no.

**Cross-language Performance Profile Exploration with speedscope**  
https://hacks.mozilla.org/2018/11/cross-language-performance-profile-exploration-with-speedscope/  
The goal of speedscope is to provide a 60fps way of interactively exploring large performance profiles from a variety of profilers for a variety of programming languages. It runs totally in-browser, and does not send any profiling data to any servers. Because it runs totally in-browser, it should work in Firefox and Chrome on Mac, Windows, and Linux. It can be downloaded to run offline, either from npm, or just as a totally standalone zip file.

The custom-built dashboard synchronizes multiple views in real time and uses aggregations to convey context information through a portfolio of visual tools (a recent IEEE Systems article provides additional information on the underlying knowledge extraction and visualization methods). 

**OWASP Releases a Report on Serverless Security Risks**  
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Serverless_Top_10_Project  
OWASP Serverless Top 10 aims at educating practitioners and organizations about the consequences of the most common serverless application security vulnerabilities, as well as providing basic techniques to identify and protect against them.

**Cross shard transactions at 10 million requests per second**  
https://blogs.dropbox.com/tech/2018/11/cross-shard-transactions-at-10-million-requests-per-second/  
This blog post focuses on our recent deployment of cross shard transactions, which addressed this deficiency in Edgestore’s API, allowing atomic transactions across colos.

**Writing Quality Vulnerability Reports**  
https://blog.npmjs.org/post/179430064885/writing-quality-vulnerability-reports  
npm offers a way for security researchers, package users, package maintainers, and community members to report security vulnerabilities via the “Report a Vulnerability” button on npm Package pages. This provides the community a way to participate in coordinated disclosure with the package maintainer instead of opening a public issue, which could put users at risk.

**Trace Context - W3C First Public Working Draft**  
https://www.w3.org/blog/news/archives/7369  
Distributed tracing is a set of tools and practices to monitor the health and reliability of a distributed application. A distributed application is an application that consists of multiple components that are deployed and operated separately. It is also known as micro-service. The main concept behind distributed tracing is event correlation. Event correlation is a way to correlate events from one component to the events from another. It allows to find the cause-and-effect relationship between these events. For instance – find which user action in a browser caused a failure in the business logic layer.

**How Data Visualization Became Completely Meaningless**  
https://medium.com/s/story/stone-soup-anyone-7004e8aed92  
As with any popular idea, “data as art” has produced mixed results. But there is one particular instance of this I want to focus on, and that is the use of data as a fake ingredient. What do I mean by “fake”? Often, data is mentioned in an artwork’s marketing materials but does nothing noticeable or meaningful to the work itself.

**Why Do All Websites Look the Same?**  
https://medium.com/s/story/on-the-visual-weariness-of-the-web-8af1c969ce73  
The internet suffers from a lack of imagination, so I asked my students to redesign it.oday’s internet is bland. Everything looks the same: generic fonts, no layouts to speak of, interchangeable pages, and an absence of expressive visual language. Even micro-typography is a mess. Web design today seems to be driven by technical and ideological constraints rather than creativity and ideas. Every page consists of containers in containers in containers; sometimes text, sometimes images. Nothing is truly designed, it’s simply assumed. 另附：[What is the future of the web interface?](https://medium.com/@neilsmyth9/what-is-the-future-of-the-web-interface-d7c0d3306899).
