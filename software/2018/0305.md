**Announcing Flutter beta 1: Build beautiful native apps**  
https://developers.googleblog.com/2018/02/announcing-flutter-beta-1.html  
Flutter targets the sweet spot of mobile development: performance and platform integrations of native mobile, with high-velocity development and multi-platform reach of portable UI toolkits. 附：[如何评价 Google 的 Flutter](https://www.zhihu.com/question/50156415)

**Beyond React 16**  
https://reactjs.org/blog/2018/03/01/sneak-peek-beyond-react-16.html  
Dan Abramov from our team just spoke at JSConf Iceland 2018 with a preview of some new features we’ve been working on in React. The talk opens with a question: “With vast differences in computing power and network speed, how do we deliver the best user experience for everyone?” 附：[如何评价React的新功能Time Slice 和Suspense](https://www.zhihu.com/question/268028123).

**Pagedraw - Effortlessly turn mockups into functional code**  
https://pagedraw.io/  
Pagedraw is a UI builder that turns mockups into React code. Pagedraw lets you annotate mockups with extra information (like how to connect to the backend, resize for different screens, etc.) to get full, presentational, React Components. They’re React Components just like any others, so they can be interleaved freely with handwritten ones. They don’t require any new dependencies and work well with any existing JSX build system. 附：[Launch HN: Pagedraw (YC W18) – Compile UI Mockups to React Code](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16467387)、[One of These Site and Page Building Tools is Meant for You](https://www.sitepoint.com/one-of-these-site-and-page-building-tools-is-meant-for-you/).

**Tracing from JS to the DOM and back again**  
https://v8project.blogspot.com/2018/03/tracing-js-dom.html  
Debugging memory leaks in Chrome 66 just became much easier. Chrome’s DevTools can now trace and snapshot C++ DOM objects and display all reachable DOM objects from JavaScript with their references. This feature is one of the benefits of the new C++ tracing mechanism of the V8 garbage collector.

**The inception of ESLint**  
https://www.nczonline.net/blog/2018/02/the-inception-of-eslint/  
I recently realized that I'd never shared the origin story of ESLint. I've shared some of the decisions I made along the way in previous posts but never the initial domino that fell and led to ESLint's creation. As you will see, ESLint wasn't created through some divine intervention or stroke of insight, but rather through a series of events that eventually built up to ESLint's creation.

**发布 umi 1.0**  
https://juejin.im/post/5a93aeadf265da4e6f1805de  
umi 是一个类 next.js 的专注性能的前端框架，他的优势是：内置的大量性能优化；多端，无缝支持容器和浏览器访问；类 webpack 的插件机制；针对 antd 和 dva 有友好的支持。

**来认识一下Weex 的 JS Framework**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzAxNDEwNjk5OQ==&mid=2650401146&idx=1&sn=aa9ea9140b878c4b42be65f464143f40  
无论前端框架里数据管理和组件管理的策略是什么样的，它们最终都将调用 JS Framework 提供的接口来调用原生功能并且渲染真实 UI。底层渲染引擎中也不必关心上层框架中组件化的语法和更新策略是怎样的，只需要处理 JS Framework 中统一定义的节点结构和渲染指令。多了这么一层抽象，有利于标准的统一，也使得跨框架和跨平台成为了可能。

**RIP Redux: Dan Abramov announces future fetcher API**  
https://react-etc.net/entry/rip-redux-dan-abramov-announces-future-fetcher  
Unlike Redux Future Fetcher is not a new library, but rather a new concept that is being rolled into React in the form of the Context API that will simply render a lot of the tasks done by Redux obsolete. 

**Redesigning Redux**  
https://hackernoon.com/redesigning-redux-b2baee8b8a38  
Shouldn’t state management be a solved problem by now? Intuitively, developers seem to know a hidden truth: state management seems harder than it needs to be. In this article, we’ll try to answer some questions you’ve probably been asking yourself: Do you really need a library for state management? Is the popularity of Redux deserved? Why or why not? Could we make a better state management solution? If so, how?

**The Lost Art of the Makefile**  
http://www.olioapps.com/blog/the-lost-art-of-the-makefile/  
My guess is that a large portion of the Javascript community did not come from a background of Unix programming, and never had a good opportunity to learn what Make is capable of. I want to provide a quick primer here; I will go over the contents of the Makefile that I use with my own Javascript projects.

**What Google AMP means for the JavaScript community**  
https://molily.de/amp/  
What is clear to me is that the JavaScript community needs to sweep in front of its own door. It needs to criticize AMP but also learn from AMP. The broad web community needs to adapt technical principles that improve performance. But instead of following a centralized, authoritarian approach, we need to fix the web in a concerted community effort.

**How GDPR Will Change The Way You Develop**  
https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/02/gdpr-for-web-developers/  
In this article, we’ll explore what you, as a developer, need to know about the new data protection regime. At the end, you’ll understand how the challenges posed by the privacy overhaul will ultimately help to make you a better developer. 附：[GDPR – A PRACTICAL GUIDE FOR DEVELOPERS](https://techblog.bozho.net/gdpr-practical-guide-developers/)

**How I Learned to Stop Worrying and ❤️ the State Machine**  
http://raganwald.com/2018/02/23/forde.html  
By recognizing when domain models should be represented first and foremost as state machines–or recognizing when to refactor domain models into state machines–we keep our models understandable and workable. We tame their complexity. So, what are state machines? And how do they help?

**When to use CQRS?!**  
https://community.risingstack.com/when-to-use-cqrs/  
One of the simplest and most frequently cited explanations is that CQRS is in principle the same as the design pattern CQS, applied to the architectural level of an application. This comparison is quite correct, but for someone who is not yet familiar with CQRS, it is difficult to understand and therefore hardly helpful.

**Mobile Real-time Video Segmentation**  
https://research.googleblog.com/2018/03/mobile-real-time-video-segmentation.html  
We are excited to bring precise, real-time, on-device mobile video segmentation to the YouTube app by integrating this technology into stories. Currently in limited beta, stories is YouTube’s new lightweight video format, designed specifically for YouTube creators. Our new segmentation technology allows creators to replace and modify the background, effortlessly increasing videos’ production value without specialized equipment.

**Air Traffic Controller: Member-First Notifications at LinkedIn**  
https://engineering.linkedin.com/blog/2018/03/air-traffic-controller--member-first-notifications-at-linkedin  
This platform became Air Traffic Controller (ATC)—the ultimate decision maker for notifications sent to our members. In this post, we’ll discuss why ATC is important to LinkedIn, the technology ATC is built on, the ATC platform, and features, as well as the challenges and lessons learned building a scalable and high throughput platform.

This post is the first installment of a three-part mini-series on data architecture at Reddit, starting with Reddit’s data “origin story” and finishing with our present-day practices.

**Microservices: It’s All About the Events**  
https://thenewstack.io/microservices-its-all-about-the-events/  
The idea of Microservices is to break large monolithic apps into smaller sets of coordinating services, so each service can be replaced or scaled up, without the heavy lifting of changing the entire monolith. Event-driven design is a way of extending applications without modifying them, Richardson explained.

**A Practical Introduction to Container Terminology**  
https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2018/02/22/container-terminology-practical-introduction/  
Without a good handle on the terminology, It can be difficult to grasp the key differences between docker and (pick your favorites, CRI-O, rkt, lxc/lxd) or understand what the Open Container Initiative is doing to standardize container technology.

**WebAssembly architecture for Go**  
https://docs.google.com/document/d/131vjr4DH6JFnb-blm_uRdaC0_Nv3OUwjEY5qVCxCup4/preview#heading=h.mjo1bish3xni  
This documents describes the design decisions that went into the new WebAssembly architecture (short “wasm”) for the Go compiler. The goal is to upstream it to the official Go repository in the current development cycle, targeting Go 1.11. The WebAssembly architecture will allow Go to become an alternative to JavaScript for writing code that runs in a web browser. This new freedom of choice will hopefully have a positive impact on the software engineering ecosystem overall.

**Third party CSS is not safe**  
https://jakearchibald.com/2018/third-party-css-is-not-safe/  
Third party content has a high impact within its sandbox. An image or a sandboxed iframe has a pretty small sandbox, but script & style are scoped to your page, or even the whole origin. If you're worried about users tricking your site into loading third party resources, you can use CSP as a safety net, to limit where images, scripts and styles can be fetched from.

**版本控制工具 Abstract 是如何提升设计团队协作效率的**  
http://www.uisdc.com/abstract-improve-collaboration-efficiency  
Abstract 是基于 Git 的。如果你已经用过 GitHub 等工具，可能不会对 commit、branch、merge 这些概念感到陌生。不过，如果你是第一次使用版本控制工具的设计师，也不必担心。毕竟 Abstract 是为设计师和设计团队打造的版本控制工具，你只需要学会使用 Abstract 的客户端界面就够了。
