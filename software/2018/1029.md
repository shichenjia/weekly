**Qt Design Studio 1.0 Released**  
https://blog.qt.io/blog/2018/10/25/qt-design-studio-1-0-released/  
We believe that collaboration between designers and developers in an effective workflow fosters and boosts product innovation and ultimately leads to a  better user experience. That’s why I’m extremely happy to announce that Qt Design Studio 1.0 released today! Qt Design Studio is a UI design and development environment that enables designers and developers to rapidly prototype and develop complex and scalable UIs.

**Is WebAssembly faster than JavaScript?**  
https://lemire.me/blog/2018/10/23/is-webassembly-faster-than-javascript/  
Most programs running on web sites are written in JavaScript. There are still a few Java applets and other plugins hanging around, but they are considered obsolete at this point. It is far easier to find JavaScript front-end developers in almost any industry, except maybe gaming. I think it is almost surely going to be more labor intensive to program web applications using WebAssembly. 另附：[WebAssembly’s post-MVP future: A cartoon skill tree](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2018/10/webassemblys-post-mvp-future/).

**灵活文档：通过上下文可视化链接文本和表格数据来帮助文档阅读**  
http://vis.pku.edu.cn/blog/elastic/  
数据丰富的文档本身就是复杂的数据集，它们由不同格式的信息组成，如文本，图形和数据表。这些额外的信息形式更有利于我们对文档中的文本叙述的理解。但是，传统的打印文档的静态布局通常会妨碍对其内容的深入理解，因为这些信息往往分散各个部分。在本文中[1]，我们寻求通过将文本内容与文档中包含的数据表格相结合的上下文可视化技术来促进对这些文档的更好理解。我们解析文本内容和数据表格，使用基于关键字的匹配算法来链接这两部分，并根据读者在文档中的当前关注点来生成可视化。另附：[Visualizing quaternions - An explorable video series](https://eater.net/quaternions).

**Finally, a React Refactoring Tool - Introducing Glean**  
https://www.wix.engineering/blog/finally-a-react-refactoring-tool-introducing-glean  
React is the predominant framework today for web and mobile UI development, and it’s no surprise it is widely used by Wix Engineering. However, when it came to large-scale refactoring projects, there were no proper tools that could help with the process, and developers got used to a lot of keyboard activity with loads of ctrl+C and ctrl+V. Manual refactoring of React code was, therefore, quite time consuming and somewhat tedious, as well as error-prone when done on a massive scale. As JS is dynamic, refactoring automation could be quite a challenge to implement and that could explain the little support it has in common IDEs.

**Let the Framework do its job**  
https://blog.ionicframework.com/let-framework-do-its-job/  
One of the core changes Ionic is making is moving from custom build tooling to using the official tooling for each Framework we support.

**Applying Customer Feedback: How NLP & Deep Learning Improve Uber’s Maps**  
https://eng.uber.com/nlp-deep-learning-uber-maps/  
To address the problem of large-scale ticket analysis, we built a natural language processing (NLP) platform that looks for map data-related issues in the text of tickets. This platform can then specify which specific type of map data triggered the ticket, so that the appropriate team within our maps organization can assess the issue and determine a solution. 另附：[AI Michelangelo PyML: Introducing Uber’s Platform for Rapid Python ML Model Development](https://eng.uber.com/michelangelo-pyml/).

**Why Netflix Rolled Its Own Node.js Functions-as-a-Service Runtime**  
https://thenewstack.io/why-netflix-rolled-its-own-node-js-functions-as-a-service-runtime/  
Engineers love the “no-ops” aspect of FaaS, which makes it possible to simply upload modular chunks of functionality onto the cloud provider of your choice and then execute them as isolated, reliable, and low latency production services. Enterprises love that their devs can deploy code to production faster than ever before. Netflix, a company respected for being an early and extremely effective adopter of cloud native tech, happily embraced FaaS to keep the films flowing smoothly to their 130 million customers streaming 140 million hours of video each day.

**How to write narrative documentation**  
http://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=8175  
In fact, writing good documentation is an excellent way to ensure that you really understand the problem space you’re in, and to throw light into corners of your software where defects might lurk. Do not underestimate the power of this effect! Often enough to matter, it will save you from serious embarrassment.

**gRPC-Web is going GA**  
https://www.cncf.io/blog/2018/10/24/grpc-web-is-going-ga/  
gRPC-Web enables you to define the service “contract” between client web applications and backend gRPC servers using .proto definitions and auto-generate client JavaScript (you can choose between Closure compiler JavaScript or the more widely used CommonJS). What you get to leave out of the development process: creating custom JSON serialization and deserialization logic, wrangling HTTP status codes (which can vary across REST APIs), content type negotiation, etc.

**设计师的职责：重在参与**  
https://www.huxiu.com/article/268881.html  
严格来说，复杂适应性系统的设计师所设计的并非系统本身，他们是把一系列现有的互相关联的系统引导至他们所期望的成果。对于这些会与其他力量、想法、事件和设计师产生交互的系统，它们的设计师没有把自己置于系统的中心，而是将自己理解为塑造这些系统的“参与者”。本文的主旨是探索“参与”在这里的意义。另附：[Designers who can code are more valuable](https://uxdesign.cc/designers-who-can-code-are-more-valuable-eb7734631b03).

**大胆减少你的工作**

关于知识工作者任务的讨论，一般都从如何做计划说起。这样看来很合乎逻辑。可惜的是，知识工作者的工作计划很少有能够真正发生作用的。计划通常只是纸上谈兵，或只是良好的意愿而已，很少能够真正实现。有效的知识工作者并不是一开始就着手工作，他们往往会从时间安排上着手。他们并不以计划为起点，认识清楚自己的时间用在什么地方才是起点。然后，他们管理自己的时间，减少非生产性工作所占用的时间。最后，再将“可自由运用的时间”，由零星的集中成大块连续性的时段。

**What does Stack Overflow want to be when it grows up?**  
https://blog.codinghorror.com/what-does-stack-overflow-want-to-be-when-it-grows-up/  
I sometimes get asked by regular people in the actual real world what it is that I do for a living, and here's my 15 second answer: We built a sort of Wikipedia website for computer programmers to post questions and answers. It's called Stack Overflow. As of last month, it's been 10 years since Joel Spolsky and I started Stack Overflow. I currently do other stuff now, and I have since 2012, but if I will be known for anything when I'm dead, clearly it is going to be good old Stack Overflow. Thus, what I'd like to do right now is peer into that glorious abyss for a bit and introspect about the challenges I see facing Stack Overflow for the next 10 years.

-- THE END --
