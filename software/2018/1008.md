**How solid is Tim’s plan to redecentralize the web?**  
https://medium.com/@shevski/how-solid-is-tims-plan-to-redecentralize-the-web-b163ba78e835  
Solid is a W3C endorsed linked data personal data store (PDS) that puts control into the hands of the user, and Inrupt is the first commercial offer to build on it. However, I’m concerned Solid is ill-equipped to tackle the challenges of the data ownership space and deliver impact. This article explores some of the problems PDSs face and suggests we need a strategic approach that’s user centered, systemic and allows for a diversity of approaches to overcome centralisation.

**Plans for the Next Iteration of Vue.js**  
https://medium.com/the-vue-point/plans-for-the-next-iteration-of-vue-js-777ffea6fabf  
Vue 3.0 aims to leverage these new language features to make Vue core smaller, faster, and more powerful. Vue 3.0 is currently in prototyping phase, and we have already implemented a runtime close to feature-parity with 2.x. Many of the items listed below are either already implemented, or confirmed to be feasible. Ones that are not yet implemented or still in exploration phase are marked with a *.

**When a bar chart isn’t enough… Morph helps you turn data into art**  
https://medium.com/google-news-lab/when-a-bar-chart-isnt-enough-morph-helps-you-turn-data-into-art-986e41a33837  
Sometimes a bar chart just won’t do. Sometimes you want to see data presented in a new way, a way it just hasn’t been shown as before. That’s where [Morph](https://morph.graphics/) comes in. Morph is a brand new tool, built by data studio Datavized, to allow anyone to create their own computer-generated data art project.

**The Shapes of CSS**  
https://css-tricks.com/the-shapes-of-css/  
We also get the ::before and ::after psuedo elements in CSS, which give us the potential of two more shapes we can add to the original element. By getting clever with positioning, transforming, and many other tricks, we can make lots of shapes in CSS with only a single HTML element.

**On Node Framework Popularity**  
https://hueniverse.com/on-node-framework-popularity-355fbde5cbe4  
Much of the conversation about choosing an HTTP framework for your node.js application is about performance, features, stability, and support. But when almost every framework available delivers enterprise-grade performance, cutting edge features, and are generally well maintained, do the technical specs really matter that much? 另附：[awesome-nodejs](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome-nodejs).

**Porting a 75,000 line native iOS app to Flutter**

**Validating performance and reliability of the new Dropbox search engine**  
https://blogs.dropbox.com/tech/2018/10/validating-performance-and-reliability-of-the-new-dropbox-search-engine/  
In our previous post, we discussed the architecture of our new search engine, named Nautilus, and its use of machine intelligence to scale our search–ranking and content–understanding models. Along with best–in–class performance, scalability, and reliability, we also provided a foundation for implementing intelligent document ranking and retrieval features. This flexible system allows our engineers to easily customize the document–indexing and query–processing pipelines while maintaining strong safeguards to preserve the privacy of our users’ data. In this post, we will discuss the process that we undertook to ensure optimal performance and reliability.

**Open-sourcing StateService: Automating recovery of third-party services after a major outage**  
https://code.fb.com/open-source/stateservice/  
[StateService](https://github.com/facebookincubator/StateService) is self-documenting — the individual states become part of configuration management (CM) software, such as a Chef cookbook. By replaying the states that were previously applied to a VM (or a group of VMs), StateService returns services to their last-known state.

**Node + JS Foundation**  
https://www.linuxfoundation.org/news/2018/10/node-js-foundation-and-js-foundation-announce-intent-to-create-joint-organization-to-support-the-broad-node-js-and-javascript-communities/  
https://blog.npmjs.org/post/178734613655/node-js-foundation  
Today, JavaScript is nearly ubiquitous. Enterprises have been able to greatly reduce training costs and increase developer productivity because frontend JS developers can work on the server side, and vice-versa, eliminating the context switches and enabling all developers to pull from the same knowledge base and vast module ecosystem. Node.js is a major catalyst for this growth. It has become an important part of the modern web development stack and is often the assumed default when working with JavaScript. Merging the Foundations will bring the governance of these technologies in line with its real-world use.

**The Psychology of Design**  
https://alistapart.com/article/psychology-of-design  
There are a number of debates about which additional skills designers should learn. Should designers code, write, or understand business? These skills are incredibly valuable but perhaps not essential. However, I would argue that every designer should learn the fundamentals of psychology. But knowing where to start can be a challenge. Which principles from psychology are useful? What are some examples of these principles at work? In this article, I’ll cover the basics, and discuss the ethical implications of using psychology in design.

**Product Design by Google**

They’re also useful if you have completed the course and would like notes to help retain what you’ve learnt.

**Why I feel UX design should really be called User Engagement Design**  
https://uxdesign.cc/why-i-feel-ux-design-should-really-be-called-user-engagement-design-4895188f7e86  
Audacity and Humility are traits I would associate with User Engagement Design; thus I feel like User Experience Design could potentially morph into User Engagement Design as we begin to step back and take a more macro big-picture view of what the profession truly is doing.
