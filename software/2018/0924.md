**David Patterson Says It’s Time for New Computer Architectures and Software Languages**  
https://spectrum.ieee.org/view-from-the-valley/computing/hardware/david-patterson-says-its-time-for-new-computer-architectures-and-software-languages  
David Patterson—University of California professor, Google engineer, and RISC pioneer—says there’s no better time than now to be a computer architect. Revolutionary new hardware architectures and new software languages, tailored to dealing with specific kinds of computing problems, are just waiting to be developed, There are Turing Awards waiting to be picked up if people would just work on these things. 另附：[Is “data scientist” the new “programmer”?](http://blogs.harvard.edu/philg/2018/09/18/is-data-scientist-the-new-programmer/)

**Improving DataView performance in V8**  
https://v8project.blogspot.com/2018/09/dataview.html  
Because of the performance penalty, JavaScript developers such as the Google Maps team decided to avoid DataViews and rely on TypedArrays instead, at the cost of increased code complexity. This blog post explains how we brought DataView performance to match — and even surpass — equivalent TypedArray code in V8 v6.9, effectively making DataView usable for performance-critical real-world applications.

**Putting This Blog on IPFS**  
https://ipfs.io/ipns/Qme48wyZ7LaF9gC5693DZyJBtehgaFhaKycESroemD5fNX/post/putting_this_blog_on_ipfs/  
IPFS, the Interplanetary File System, is a global distributed immutable datastore, an effort to decentralize and distribute the load of hosting websites, which I first wrote about back in 2016. IPFS is a peer-to-peer file system composed of thousands of computers around the world, each of which stores files on behalf of the network. These files can be anything: cat pictures, 3D models, or even entire websites. It’s a great technology, and of course that means that [Cloudflare wants to run a monkey-in-the-middle attack on it](https://blog.cloudflare.com/distributed-web-gateway/). 另附：[End-to-End Integrity with IPFS](https://blog.cloudflare.com/e2e-integrity/).

In this 4-part blog series, we’ll look inside the Chrome browser from high-level architecture to the specifics of the rendering pipeline. If you ever wondered how the browser turns your code into a functional website, or you are unsure why a specific technique is suggested for performance improvements, this series is for you. 另附：[How browser rendering works — behind the scenes](https://blog.logrocket.com/how-browser-rendering-works-behind-the-scenes-6782b0e8fb10)

**美菜无线前端架构模型2018**  
https://tech.meicai.cn/detail/55  
工作流水线，全面模块化、插件化，贯彻了我们的开发阶段。工程化的最大收益是精力的收敛，非聚焦模块托管+监控，同时最大限度提升灵活性。Everything is plugin，我们目前的插件化还仅仅是第一步。人力梯队同样采用面包板，职能分工，同时展开流动。短期强前台、小中台，中台承担部分基础建设功能，但是不会垄断“架构”。我们未来的工作重点要转向更加高可用的框架体系：根据实际场景合理选型、预见以年为单位的架构挑战。

**多端统一开发框架 Taro 1.0 正式发布**  
https://aotu.io/notes/2018/09/18/taro-1-0-0/  
Taro 是一个多端统一开发框架，它支持使用 React 的开发方式来编写可以同时在微信小程序、Web 、React Native 等多个平台上运行的应用，帮助开发者提升开发效率，改善开发体验，降低多端研发成本。自开源以来，Taro 一直广受业界关注，其原理与思想也得到了广泛开发者的认可，这对于我们来说无疑是一件令人振奋的事。但是由于初期 Taro 测试与实现方式的不足，导致在开源期间 Bug 较多，受到了一些质疑。为此，我们痛定思痛，积极接受了开源社区的意见与帮助，并努力探索提升 Taro 稳定性与性能的方式。经过不断地迭代完善，已经让 Taro 浴火重生。

**新项目的最优技术实践三步曲**  
https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/44808764  
项目初期的实践分为了三个时期：技术准备期。进行一系列充分、不充分的技术工作，从搭建脚手架，到部署测试等等。业务回补期。填补第一个时期造成的业务落后问题，技术实践业务来证明技术的价值；成长优化期。持续地对项目的技术和业务进行优化，以实现开发及业务人员的诉求；每个时期都有自己要所要面对的挑战。

**Hinting at a better web at State of the Browser 2018**  
https://christianheilmann.com/2018/09/16/hinting-at-a-better-web-at-state-of-the-browser-2018/  
My talk this year was hinting at a better web in which I cover the changes the web went through over the years and how as developers we have a harder time keeping up with them. And how tooling and using the right resources in context of our work can help us with that.

**Module Design**  
https://ponyfoo.com/articles/module-design  
Thinking in terms of API-driven and documentation-driven design will yield more usable modules than not doing so. You might argue that internals are not that important: “as long as the interface holds, we can put anything we want in the mix!”. A usable interface is only one side of the equation; it will do little to keep the maintainability of your applications in check. Properly designed module internals help keep our code readable and its intent clear. In this chapter we’ll debate what it takes to write modules with scalability in mind, but without getting too far ahead of our current requirements. We’ll discuss the CRUST constraints in some more depth, and finally ellaborate on how to prune modules as they become larger and more complex over time.

**Idle Until Urgent**  
https://philipwalton.com/articles/idle-until-urgent/  
In a perfect world, none of our sites would ever block the main thread unnecessarily. We’d all be using web workers to do our non-UI work, and we’d have shouldYield() and a native Scheduling API) built into the browser. But in our current world, we web developers often have no choice but to run non-UI code on the main thread, which leads to unresponsiveness and jank. Hopefully this article has convinced you of the need to break up our long-running JavaScript tasks. 

**The Making of Underrun – A WebGL Shooter in 13kb of JavaScript**

**Twenty Years as a Freelance Web Developer: Wisdom Gained and Lessons Learned**  
https://css-tricks.com/twenty-years-as-a-freelance-web-developer-wisdom-gained-and-lessons-learned/  
In the summer of 1998, when President Clinton fended off allegations of sexual impropriety and Donald Trump filmed a cameo in a Woody Allen movie, I embarked on my career as a freelance web developer. Twenty years and more than 300 websites later, I’m still at it—always working on my own and always from home. Those interested in making the switch to freelancing have often asked me for advice, and I’ve been happy to help with whatever words of wisdom I can provide. This article is a distillation of much of that. And it may prove helpful not only to developers and programmers who wish to freelance, but also designers, project managers, copywriters—anyone who desires to work independently from home in our industry. It’s a career path that I have loved, but it’s not for everyone. 另附：[What makes a good front-end developer?](https://css-tricks.com/what-makes-a-good-front-end-developer/).

**How to Become a Better Software Developer: A Handbook on Personal Performance**  
https://www.7pace.com/blog/become-a-better-programmer-skills-development  
Writing code is the output–and almost anyone can learn the basics of syntax and formatting. But what makes someone a skilled developer? It’s much more than just understanding the basics, of course. It’s mastery of the fundamental concepts and logic that make one capable. But, in order to be great, there must also be a way to measure, evaluate, and improve that performance. This handbook is meant to be a guide to developer performance–how to understand it, measure it, and improve it.

**NGINX and Gartner’s Top 10 Trends Impacting Infrastructure & Operations**

The roles and responsibilities of Infrastructure & Operations (I&O) teams are ever‑changing. Gartner has identified the [Top 10 Technology Trends Impacting Infrastructure & Operations for 2018](https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/top-10-technology-trends-impacting-infrastructure-operations-for-2018/). As we gear up for our annual user conference, NGINX Conf 2018, I wanted to take a look at how the NGINX Application Platform helps you keep up with each of the ten trends.

**Build impossible programs**  
https://jvns.ca/blog/2018/09/18/build-impossible-programs/  
My talk from Deconstruct this year (“Build impossible programs”) is up. It’s about my experience building a Ruby profiler. This is the second talk I’ve given about building a profiler – the first one (Building a Ruby profiler) was more of a tech deep dive. This one is a squishier talk about myths I believed about doing ambitious work and how a lot of those myths turn out not to be true.

**Death By Database**  
https://ovid.github.io/articles/death-by-database.html  
The following is a true story, but with names changed. When I work with clients to build software, I take the usual steps of understanding their needs, gathering requirements, learning about their customers, and so on. At this point I have a model on paper of roughly what the software is intended to do, so they get surprised when I immediately turn to database design. "Who care about database design? What about mockups? What about workflows?" 另附：[SQL Style Guide](https://www.sqlstyle.guide/).

https://www.w3.org/blog/2018/09/css-fonts-3-is-a-w3c-recommendation/  
Controlling font usage has been part of CSS since the beginning – at least for simple things like bold, italic, small-caps, whether you want serif or sans-serif. The font family could also be specified, although until downloadable fonts became a dependable reality with WOFF, that involved guessing which fonts were ‘commonly available’. CSS Fonts 3 added downloadable font support to CSS with @font-face, and also control of OpenType features.另附：[Web Audio API is Now a W3C Candidate Recommendation](https://www.w3.org/TR/webaudio/)
