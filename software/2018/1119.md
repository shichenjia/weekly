**Google - Web.Dev: Let's build the future of the web.**  
https://web.dev/  
A new site that aims to bring together all of the Web performance expertise Google has as a set of docs packed with actionable guidance and analysis. With actionable guidance and analysis, web.dev helps developers like you learn and apply the web's modern capabilities to your own sites and apps. 另附：[CSS and Network Performance](https://csswizardry.com/2018/11/css-and-network-performance/)、[Measure, Optimize & Monitor](https://medium.com/@addyosmani/measure-optimize-monitor-33e36108e014)、[Google announces .dev top-level domain, open registration in February](https://9to5google.com/2018/11/12/google-dev-top-level-domain-registration/)、[PageSpeed Insights, now powered by Lighthouse](https://blog.chromium.org/2018/11/pagespeed-insights-now-powered-by.html).

**Faster async functions and promises**  
https://v8.dev/blog/fast-async  
Asynchronous processing in JavaScript traditionally had a reputation for not being particularly fast. To make matters worse, debugging live JavaScript applications — in particular Node.js servers — is no easy task, especially when it comes to async programming. Luckily the times, they are a-changin’. This article explores how we optimized async functions and promises in V8 (and to some extent in other JavaScript engines as well), and describes how we improved the debugging experience for async code.

**HTTP/3**  
https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2018/11/11/http-3/  
The protocol that's been called HTTP-over-QUIC for quite some time has now changed name and will officially become HTTP/3. This was triggered by this original suggestion by Mark Nottingham. The QUIC Working Group in the IETF works on creating the QUIC transport protocol. QUIC is a TCP replacement done over UDP. Originally, QUIC was started as an effort by Google and then more of a "HTTP/2-encrypted-over-UDP" protocol.

**Which of the 635000 npm modules do I choose?**  
https://www.coreycleary.me/which-of-the-635000-npm-modules-do-i-choose/  
It’s easy to face “analysis paralysis” when choosing npm modules. With so many to choose from, and new ones being touted as “what you really should switch to” it can be overwhelming to pick the right one for your project. And it doesn’t help that so many of these modules do similar (or the same) things. Rather than waste time Googling around, combing through npmjs.org, and wasting more time NOT building your application, it would be great to know which modules to choose when. 另附：[386 Useful Javascript libraries](https://github.com/selfrefactor/useful-javascript-libraries)、[Top 10 Node.js Developer Tools](https://stackify.com/node-js-developer-tools/).

https://medium.freecodecamp.org/these-are-the-concepts-you-should-know-in-react-js-after-you-learn-the-basics-ee1d2f4b8030  
In the following article, I’m going to discuss 5 concepts that will bring your React skills and knowledge to the next level.

**西安交大提出前端设计图自动转代码新方法**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzUxMzcxMzE5Ng==&mid=2247489854&idx=1&sn=4828d5d36c3becdf8b1f46490b5ce708  
对于前端工程师来说，开发 GUI 界面极其耗费时间和精力。这种重复、繁琐的工作是否可以交给机器自动化完成，是目前 AI 领域研究人员积极探索的新方向。最近，西安交通大学的人工智能与机器人研究所提出了一种新的方法，可以帮助前端工程师将设计好的 GUI 图自动转换为代码，不仅在简单布局的 GUI 上可以生成非常好的代码，即使在图形元素复杂、样式复杂、空间布局复杂的情况下，生成效果也非常接近真实情况。附论文：https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.11536.pdf

**构建时预渲染：网页首帧优化实践**  
https://tech.meituan.com/first_contentful_paint_practice.html  
自JavaScript诞生以来，前端技术发展非常迅速。移动端白屏优化是前端界面体验的一个重要优化方向，Web 前端诞生了 SSR 、CSR、预渲染等技术。在美团支付的前端技术体系里，通过预渲染提升网页首帧优化，从而优化了白屏问题，提升用户体验，并形成了最佳实践。

**Building a Modern JavaScript Framework**  
https://www.sitepen.com/blog/2018/11/12/building-a-modern-javascript-framework/  
In this talk, James laid down the history of the ArcGIS JavaScript API and why the Dojo Toolkit was chosen as its bedrock. At the time of inception, the Dojo Toolkit provided many appealing features, such as a module system, browser compatibility for APIs, and a uniform surface for handling vector graphics with dojo.gfx. James explained how that in more recent times, the ecosystem has developed and the challenges developers face has also changed in response. 

**Why Facebook's api starts with a for loop**  
https://dev.to/antogarand/why-facebooks-api-starts-with-a-for-loop-1eob  
If you ever inspected your requests to big company's API's in the browser, you might have noticed some weird javascript before the JSON itself. Why would they waste few bytes to invalidate this JSON?

**Faster web**  
https://codeburst.io/faster-web-c6823830ce72  
If Virtual DOM is slow by design, and DOM API is tedious to use, how do we get the faster web?

**Delivering Meaning with Previews on Web**  
https://medium.com/netflix-techblog/delivering-meaning-with-previews-on-web-3cedc0341b9e  
Giving members meaning via video previews brings new technical and experiential challenges. It would need to have fast playback, smooth transitions, and minimal friction. The tasks ahead of us were: Optimize the existing homepage to reduce CPU load and network traffic; Integrate video preview playback in existing canvases; Create an intuitive user experience.

**elm-ui: Forget CSS and enjoy creating UIs in pure Elm**  
https://korban.net/posts/elm/2019-11-17-elm-ui-introduction/  
Creating UIs with CSS is rarely as straightforward as you expect. A few weeks ago I wanted to make the navigation on my site responsive, having it switch from a row of links to a hamburger slideout menu. Seems like a reasonable thing to do with CSS, right? Not really. As often happens, I tried a few reasonable things -- they didn't work. I started searching for solutions -- most involved JavaScript.

**Braces to Pixels**  
https://alistapart.com/article/braces-to-pixels  
Doesn’t CSS seem like magic? Well, in this third installment of “URL to Interactive” we’ll look at the journey that your browser goes through to take your CSS from braces to pixels. As a bonus, we’ll also quickly touch on how end-user interaction affects this process. We have a lot of ground to cover, so grab a cup of `<insert your favorite drink’s name here>`, and let’s get going.

**How we use Storybook for documentation and code reviews**  
https://medium.com/redmart-engineering/how-we-use-storybook-for-documentation-and-code-reviews-550a522543f1  
Storybook is a tool for organising such a component library. We also use it for other purposes like documenting component states and communicating changes in PRs.

**How Druid enables analytics at Airbnb**  
https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/druid-airbnb-data-platform-601c312f2a4c  
Realtime and batch analytics at Airbnb and the role Druid plays in our analytics system architecture.

**NGINX and the “Power of Two Choices” Load-Balancing Algorithm**  
https://www.nginx.com/blog/nginx-power-of-two-choices-load-balancing-algorithm/  
New use cases sometimes require new load‑balancing algorithms, and in NGINX Plus R16 and open source NGINX 1.15.1 we added a new method that is particularly suitable for distributed load balancers: an implementation of the “power of two choices” algorithm.

**The C++ Build Process Explained**  
https://github.com/green7ea/cpp-compilation/blob/master/README.md  
The C++ build process is built on top of the C build process which was hacked together in 1972 on a PDP-7 with at most 144 KB of RAM. Honestly, I'm surprised it aged so well. The exact linking process in C and C++ isn't standard, it's up to each compiler to make things work. Most compilers behave in the same way with small differences but we'll be focusing on the GNU tools to keep things simple.

**Vim in the Future**  
https://emily.st/2018/11/13/vim-in-the-future/  
There is something of a tradition of programmers writing posts about Vim. Many proselytize, and others are narratives of discovery. What I want to contribute to the conversation about Vim, in this late year of 2018, is what role it still plays in a world that is technologically rushing by. I’m going to tell you more about Vim, why I use it, and how I use it, so that I can say why it might still be worthwhile looking at—or not.

**Nine years of Go**  
https://blog.golang.org/9years  
Today marks the ninth anniversary of the day we open-sourced our initial sketch of Go. On each anniversary we like to take time to reflect on what has happened over the past year. The past 12 months have been a breakout year for the Go language and community. 附： [Participate in the 2018 Go User Survey](https://blog.golang.org/survey2018)、[Lorca - Build cross-platform modern desktop apps in Go + HTML5](https://github.com/zserge/lorca).
