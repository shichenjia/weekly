**How Facebook 3D Photos Work**  
https://medium.com/@akella/how-facebook-3d-photos-work-8424cf48f061  
Facebook recently rolled out a new feature, 3D Photos, or, as they call it in their javascript: 2.5D Photos. But how does it work under the hood? I like to learn new ideas by reading other people’s code. So I was curious enough to learn how they implemented this effect at Facebook. Here is the story. If you just want to know the tech, skip to the “how it all works” part.

**npm and the future of JavaScript**  
https://slides.com/seldo/npm-future-of-javascript#/  
Three parts: What you should know about npm. What npm knows about you. The future of JavaScript.

**Why I no Longer use Redux with React**  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUlwhe-kmog  
I used to use Redux with React all the time, but lately I've been using different libraries. Why do I no longer use Redux and what do I use instead? 另附：[Avoiding unnecessary renders with React context](https://frontarm.com/articles/react-context-performance/)

**Rhythm in Web Typography**  
https://betterwebtype.com/rhythm-in-web-typography  
Horizontal rhythm mostly impacts the legibility, while vertical rhythm impacts the readability of the text and establishes a sense of visual hierarchy.

**CSS Border-Radius Can Do That**  
https://9elements.com/io/css-border-radius/  
When you use eight values specifying border-radius in CSS, you can create organic looking shapes. WOW. No time to read it all ?— we made a [visual tool for you](https://9elements.github.io/fancy-border-radius/).

**Smart Bundling: How To Serve Legacy Code Only To Legacy Browsers**  
https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/10/smart-bundling-legacy-code-browsers/  
While effective bundling of resources on the web has received a great deal of mindshare in recent times, how we ship front-end resources to our users has remained pretty much the same. The average weight of JavaScript and style resources that a website ships with is rising — even though build tooling to optimize the website has never been better. With the marketshare of evergreen browsers rising fast and browsers launching support for new features in lockstep, is it time we rethink asset delivery for the modern web?

**Replacing the cache replacement algorithm in memcached**  
https://memcached.org/blog/modern-lru/  
In this post we delve into a reworking of memcached’s Least Recently Used (LRU) algorithm which was made default when 1.5.0 was released. Most of these features have been available via the “-o modern” switch for years. The 1.5.x series has enabled them all to work in concert to reduce RAM requirements.

**MobileLab: Highly accurate testing to prevent mobile performance regressions**  
https://code.fb.com/android/mobilelab/  
At Facebook’s scale, that means checking thousands of commits per day to find regressions as tiny as 1 percent. Previous methods worked well for spotting large performance changes, but to refine the accuracy, we had to build a new system, called MobileLab, in which our tests and environment could be substantially more deterministic. Now in production, MobileLab has already prevented thousands of regressions from shipping, thanks to its ability to detect very small changes in performance (as small as 1 percent for many of our metrics).

**Lumen: Custom, Self-Service Dashboarding For Netflix**  
https://medium.com/netflix-techblog/lumen-custom-self-service-dashboarding-for-netflix-8c56b541548c  
Netflix generates a lot of data. One of the ways that we gain useful insights is by visualizing that data in dashboards which allow us to comprehend large amounts of information quickly. This is particularly important when operational issues arise as our engineers need to be able to quickly diagnose problem areas and work to correct them.

We wanted to understand what our customers’ challenges are as Algorithmia plans to develop products, services, and content to help move the industry forward. We heard from over 500 decision makers at companies representing various sizes and industries. We want to share their knowledge with the industry at large.

**How Lisp Became God's Own Programming Language**  
https://twobithistory.org/2018/10/14/lisp.html  
Lisp hasn’t survived for over half a century because programmers have begrudgingly conceded that it is the best tool for the job decade after decade; in fact, it has survived even though most programmers do not use it at all. Thanks to its origins and use in artificial intelligence research and perhaps also the legacy of SICP, Lisp continues to fascinate people. Until we can imagine God creating the world with some newer language, Lisp isn’t going anywhere.

**Good Performance is Good Design**  
https://uxplanet.org/good-performance-is-good-design-the-5-principles-of-performant-design-54ca44c7c4e0  
With more ways to shop and less time to do it, consumers are impatient and increasingly demanding of the products they give their time to. Crafting highly performant digital experiences to meet these expectations means going beyond technical processes that speed up load times. It’s time for designers to own performance as a fundamental principle of good UX. It’s time for Performant Design.

**IMDb app redesigned UX & UI**  
https://medium.com/@nourdinediouane/imdb-redesigned-ux-ui-167a59c27642  
I have been using IMDb’s application for a long time, and I always thought that this app could be better⏤ like so much better. But back then, I had no idea whatsoever about something called user experience, or user interface. Now that I do, I decided to update the whole experience, making it more efficient and better-looking.

**Designing for Cognitive Differences**  
https://alistapart.com/article/designing-for-cognitive-differences  
Many affective and anxiety disorders qualify as disabilities, with inattention causing challenges on the web as well. Whatever the cause, inattention, anxiety, and depression can have a major impact on internet usage for users dealing with them.
