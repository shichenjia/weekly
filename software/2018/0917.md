**Next Generation Package Management**  
https://blog.npmjs.org/post/178027064160/next-generation-package-management  
What if installs were so fast they could happen in the background, just by using Node? What if every file in your dependencies could be guaranteed to be bit-by-bit identical to what’s on the registry? What if working on a new project was as simple as clone and run? What if your build tools got out of your way? Introducing tink, a proof of concept implementation of an install-less installer. 另附：[Yarn Plug'n'Play: Getting rid of node_modules](https://github.com/yarnpkg/rfcs/pull/101)  

**Introducing the React Profiler**  
https://reactjs.org/blog/2018/09/10/introducing-the-react-profiler.html  
React 16.5 adds support for a new DevTools profiler plugin. This plugin uses React’s experimental Profiler API to collect timing information about each component that’s rendered in order to identify performance bottlenecks in React applications. It will be fully compatible with our upcoming time slicing and suspense features. 另附：[The Rise of Immer in React](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2018/09/12/the-rise-of-immer-in-react/)

**Celebrating 10 years of V8**  
https://v8project.blogspot.com/2018/09/10-years.html

This post gives an overview of major milestones for the V8 project in the past 10 years as well as the years before, when the project was still secret. 另附：[10 years of Speed in Chrome](https://blog.chromium.org/2018/09/10-years-of-speed-in-chrome_11.html)、[How we designed Chrome 10 years ago](https://blog.chromium.org/2018/09/how-we-designed-chrome-10-years-ago.html)

**Breaking the Deadlock Between User Experience and Developer Experience**  
https://alistapart.com/article/breaking-the-deadlock-between-user-experience-and-developer-experience  
It’s tempting to frame UX and DX as opposing forces in a zero-sum game: for one to get better, the other needs to get worse. And in many apps, that certainly appears to be the case. DX at the expense of UX is a design problem. If software is designed to make developers’ lives easier without considering the user, it’s no wonder that problems arise later on.

**面向体验的重构优化**  
https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/44203056  
前端重构程序员是一个关注代码同时还要留意体验的异类。代码的优化虽然难，但是有比较多的性能测试工具去证明优化的成果。然而体验这种东西，我们又要如何去证明它的好与坏呢？今天我着重会基于「webnovel」PC站点从以上两点给大家介绍，如何从体验的角度去做重构的优化，并如何用数据去证明你的优化是有效果的。

**如何降低软件的复杂性**  
http://www.ruanyifeng.com/blog/2018/09/complexity.html  
John Ousterhout 是斯坦福大学计算机系教授，也是 Tcl 语言的创造者。Ousterhout 教授认为，软件设计的最大目标，就是降低复杂性（complexity）。 所谓复杂性，就是任何使得软件难于理解和修改的因素。复杂性的来源主要有两个：代码的含义模糊和互相依赖。

**What I Learnt Creating Guitar Dashboard: SVG, TypeScript and Music Theory**  
http://mikehadlow.blogspot.com/2018/09/what-i-learned-creating-guitar.html  
[Guitar Dashboard](http://guitardashboard.com/) is a side project I’ve been working on occasionally over the past two years. It’s an [open source web application](https://github.com/mikehadlow/gtr-cof). It’s intended as an interactive music theory explorer for guitarists that graphically links theoretical concepts, such as scales, modes and chords to the guitar fretboard. This post outlines what I’ve learnt, technically and musically while building Guitar Dashboard.  There are probably things here that are only interesting to software developers, and others only of interest to musicians, but I expect there’s a sizable group of people, like me, who fit in the intersection of that Venn diagram and who will find it interesting. 另附：[Hacklily – sheet music editor](https://www.hacklily.org/)

**The 12 Things You Need to Consider When Evaluating Any New JavaScript Library**  
https://medium.freecodecamp.org/the-12-things-you-need-to-consider-when-evaluating-any-new-javascript-library-3908c4ed3f49  
How do you know if a new technology is worth investing time into? For this year’s State of JavaScript survey I wanted to dig a little bit deeper, and not only know which tools and libraries people were using, but also why they were using them. Which means I had to find a way to translate personal preferences into cold, hard data. After some research, I came up with a 12-point scale that covers the main aspects of picking and working with any technology.

**Evolving mobile architecture at Reddit**

**What makes ReasonML so great?**  
https://blog.logrocket.com/what-makes-reasonml-so-great-c2c2fc215ccb  
ReasonML is a syntax extension for the OCaml language created by Facebook. Rather than creating an entirely new language, the creators of Reason chose to build on top of OCaml, a battle-tested functional systems programming language that’s been around since the late 1990s. 另附：[Reason vs JavaScript](https://blog.pusher.com/reason-javascript/).

**Defining Roles-based Security ACLs and Supporting Multitenancy in the Node.js Strongloop Loopback framework**  
https://druckit.wordpress.com/2018/09/12/defining-roles-based-security-acls-and-supporting-multitenancy-in-the-node-js-strongloop-loopback-framework/  
Strongloop Loopback (https://loopback.io) is a Node.js framework that extends Express.js and makes it easy for developers to create REST-based CRUD APIs in minutes. In my experience, their proclamations about RAD API development generally holds true, however, their documentation and, in particular, their tutorials, really need a lot of work in terms of organization. While there’s a lot of information that’s presented, it doesn’t really flow to tell the complete story of how you would solve real-world problems and how all of the pieces really fit together. Hopefully you’ll find that this post helps bridge that gap.

**Why we used GraphQL for our API**  
https://blog.marvelapp.com/why-marvel-uses-graphql/  
Recently at Marvel we launched our Platform API. Here I’ll write about some of the thought processes we went through when we set out to build it, explain some of the problems with other APIs and their potential solutions, and cover why we made the choice to use GraphQL over REST despite the team being vastly less experienced with GraphQL.

**Keystone Real-time Stream Processing Platform**  
https://medium.com/netflix-techblog/keystone-real-time-stream-processing-platform-a3ee651812a  
Keystone Stream Processing Platform is Netflix’s data backbone and an essential piece of infrastructure that enables engineering data-driven culture. While Keystone focuses on data analytics, it is worth mentioning there is another Netflix homegrown reactive stream processing platform called Mantis that targets operational use cases. We’ll discuss Mantis and its important role in the Netflix ecosystem in a future post.

**Open Sourcing TonY: Native Support of TensorFlow on Hadoop**  
https://engineering.linkedin.com/blog/2018/09/open-sourcing-tony--native-support-of-tensorflow-on-hadoop

https://blogs.dropbox.com/tech/2018/09/machine-intelligence-at-dropbox-an-update-from-our-dbxi-team/  
When we talk about machine intelligence at Dropbox, we mean the whole range of applied machine learning, from simple linear classifiers to advanced deep learning networks. For many years we’ve been building a world-class machine learning team, improving our platform behind the scenes.

**The UX is dying**  
https://uxplanet.org/the-ux-is-dying-94d5ef6b7256  
We will never be able to stop things from happening. Life and every other material and nonmaterial things have to go through its course. The wise things are that we have to adapt to the new technologies. It has been our nature to do so. It has become really easy to find a person with a title called “UX designer” in the job market. Most of them lack the knowledge in conversational UI, AR and VR technologies and how to understand their business domain. They have to address and prioritize the domain features of a product and give their input to the growth of the business. The management of the organizations has to take UX into their head and understand the value of a UX designer as a job role and as valuable resource. Sharing the knowledge and making the people aware more about the UX industry would help newcomers to be comfortable with the word UX.

In a vote that split almost every major EU party, Members of the European Parliament adopted every terrible proposal in the new Copyright Directive and rejected every good one, setting the stage for mass, automated surveillance and arbitrary censorship of the internet: text messages like tweets and Facebook updates; photos; videos; audio; software code -- any and all media that can be copyrighted.

**Hacker culture and the politics of process defense**  
http://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=8120  
I propose to replace the question “What kind of politics should the hacker culture be engaged in?” with two that are sharper and more responsive to our duty. These questions are: 1. What exertions of power and influence do we need to resist in order to protect our processes, prevent our social machine from breaking down, and achieve our telos? 2. Should we, as a culture or as projects within that culture, engage in “politics” (however that is defined) beyond the issues selected by the previous question?
