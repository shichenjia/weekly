**A Look at the Design of Lua**  
https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2018/11/232214-a-look-at-the-design-of-lua/fulltext  
Though mainly a procedural language, Lua lends itself to several other paradigms, including object-oriented programming, functional programming, and data-driven programming.5 It also offers good support for data description, in the style of JavaScript and JSON. Data description was indeed one of our main motivations for creating Lua, some years before the appearance of XML and JavaScript. 另附：[A Philosophy of Software Design](http://www.pathsensitive.com/2018/10/book-review-philosophy-of-software.html). 

**The Ultimate Guide to JavaScript Frameworks**  
https://javascriptreport.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-javascript-frameworks/  
Keeping up with JavaScript frameworks can be a challenge. There are a lot of them, and seemingly another one every month. How do you know which ones might be right for your project? What are their strengths and weaknesses? How do you get started?

**The Eponymous Laws of Tech**  
https://daverupert.com/2018/04/eponymous-laws-of-tech/  
A compendium of tech-related laws, fallacies, and other wisdom

**Front-End Developer Handbook 2018**  
https://frontendmasters.com/books/front-end-handbook/2018/  
This is a guide that anyone could use to learn about the practice of front-end development. It broadly outlines and discusses the practice of front-end engineering: how to learn it and what tools are used when practicing it in 2018. The book should not be considered a comprehensive outline of all resources available to a front-end developer. The value of the book is tied up in a terse, focused, and timely curation of just enough categorical information so as not to overwhelm anyone on any one particular subject matter.

**How AI Wipes Out UI**  
https://uxplanet.org/how-ai-wipes-out-ui-10ecaad1356a  
Only after we master the ability to materialize things from the air, utilize quantum computers to generate data, and operate machines with our minds, can we think of the real synergy with AI. Before that, our little robots will be our assistants and will do only what they’re supposed to do. 另附：[Good Designer, Bad Designer](https://uxplanet.org/good-designer-bad-designer-eff79d356a75)

**It'S Time For An Rss Revival**  
https://www.wired.com/story/rss-readers-feedly-inoreader-old-reader/  
THE MODERN WEB contains no shortage of horrors, from ubiquitous ad trackers to all-consuming platforms to YouTube comments, generally. Unfortunately, there's no panacea for what ails this internet we've built. But anyone weary of black-box algorithms controlling what you see online at least has a respite, one that's been there all along but has often gone ignored. Tired of Twitter? Facebook fatigued? It's time to head back to RSS. 另附：[RSS is undead](https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/07/rss-is-undead/)、[Now Is The Perfect Time For An RSS Renaissance](https://neflabs.com/blog/rss-renaissance/)、[Winds 2.0: It’s Time to Revive RSS](https://getstream.io/blog/winds-2-0-its-time-to-revive-rss/)、[The Rise and Demise of RSS](https://twobithistory.org/2018/09/16/the-rise-and-demise-of-rss.html)、[RSS Is Better Than Twitter](https://gizmodo.com/rss-is-better-than-twitter-1833624929).

**What Will Programming Look Like In The Future?***  
http://highscalability.com/blog/2018/4/25/update-what-will-programming-look-like-in-the-future.html
Humans and AIs working together to produce software better than either can separately. The computer as a creative agent, working in tandem with a human partner, to produce software, in a beautiful act of co-creation. What we need is a manufacturing process that puts software production on an exponential curve. The only conceivable tool we have at the moment to put software on an exponential production curve is AI. That's the only way software can truly eat the world.

**Top UX Inspirations of all time!**  
https://medium.com/sketch-app-sources/top-ui-inspirations-of-all-time-90cb37c61c45
Good UI design facilitates making the completion of tasks as frictionless as possible and increasing usability. Good design is like a refrigerator — when it works, no one notices, but when it doesn’t, it sure stinks.

**Tech’s Two Philosophies**  
https://stratechery.com/2018/techs-two-philosophies/
Tech’s Yin and Yang. That there are two philosophies does not necessarily mean that one is right and one is wrong: the reality is we need both. Some problems are best solved by human ingenuity, enabled by the likes of Microsoft and Apple; others by collective action. That, though, gets at why Google and Facebook are fundamentally more dangerous: collective action is traditionally the domain of governments, the best form of which is bounded by the popular will. Google and Facebook, on the other hand, are accountable to no one. Both deserve all of the recent scrutiny they have attracted, and arguably deserve more.
