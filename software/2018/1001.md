**Solid – Reshape the web as we know it**  
https://solid.inrupt.com/  
Solid was created by the inventor of the World Wide Web, Sir Tim Berners-Lee. Its mission is to reshape the web as we know it. Solid will foster a new breed of applications with capabilities above and beyond anything that exists today. Solid empowers users and organizations to separate their data from the applications that use it. It allows people to look at the same data with different apps at the same time. It opens brand new avenues for creativity, problem-solving, and commerce. Learn how it came to be. 另附：[Tim Berners-Lee tells us his radical new plan to upend the World Wide Web](https://www.fastcompany.com/90243936/exclusive-tim-berners-lee-tells-us-his-radical-new-plan-to-upend-the-world-wide-web)

**Rethinking JavaScript Test Coverage**  
https://blog.npmjs.org/post/178487845610/rethinking-javascript-test-coverage  
You can now expose coverage output through Node.js by setting the environment variable NODE_V8_COVERAGE to the directory you would like coverage data output in. The tool c8 can be used to output pretty reports based on this coverage information.

**Why & How Words With Friends Is Adopting React Native**  
https://medium.com/zynga-engineering/why-how-words-with-friends-is-adopting-react-native-b24a405f421c  
In 2017, we were all hands on deck trying to launch Words With Friends 2, which was the most ambitious update to the franchise in its history. The game was well received, and helped our business in a big way, creating an opportunity to rethink how we wanted to allocate the team in 2018. We decided to spend some time in 2018 to see if we could make a step-function improvement to our technology that would allow us to deliver more to our players, faster, and without sacrificing quality.

**Mastering Modular JavaScript**  
https://github.com/mjavascript/mastering-modular-javascript  
Modular JavaScript is a book series with the mission of improving our collective understanding of writing robust, well-tested, modular JavaScript code. Mastering Modular JavaScript is the second book in the series, and it discusses modular JavaScript application development. Mastering Modular JavaScript includes hundreds of real-world patterns and practices, as well as detailed explanations of what works and what hasn’t when it comes to leveraging ES6 in the wild. 另附：[What is Modular CSS?](https://spaceninja.com/2018/09/17/what-is-modular-css/)

**How to visualize decision trees**  
http://explained.ai/decision-tree-viz/index.html  
we've created a general package for scikit-learn decision tree visualization and model interpretation, which we'll be using heavily in an upcoming machine learning book (written with Jeremy Howard). This article demonstrates the results of this work, details the specific choices we made for visualization, and outlines the tools and techniques used in the implementation. The visualization software is part of a nascent Python machine learning library called dtreeviz. 

**Intro to Generative Art**  
https://dev.to/aspittel/intro-to-generative-art-2hi7  
[Generative art](https://beta.observablehq.com/collection/@observablehq/generative-art) can be an intimidating topic -- it seems like there is a lot of math involved, and art is tricky in itself! But, it doesn't have to be difficult -- you can build some really cool things without a math or art degree. This post will break down what generative art even is and how you can get started building your own generative art.  

**如何防止XSS攻击？**  
https://tech.meituan.com/fe_security.html  
随着互联网的高速发展，信息安全问题已经成为企业最为关注的焦点之一，而前端又是引发企业安全问题的高危据点。在移动互联网时代，前端人员除了传统的 XSS、CSRF 等安全问题之外，又时常遭遇网络劫持、非法调用 Hybrid API 等新型安全问题。当然，浏览器自身也在不断在进化和发展，不断引入 CSP、Same-Site Cookies 等新技术来增强安全性，但是仍存在很多潜在的威胁，这需要前端技术人员不断进行“查漏补缺”。

**软件开发的上古智慧**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzA3MDMwOTcwMg==&mid=2650005790&idx=1&sn=ca7fda1a8d135f9ae72bc21bad486cc5  
按照Uncle Bob的说法，所谓架构，就是“用最小的人力成本来满足构建和维护系统的需求”的设计行为。以前的面向对象系统，和如今的分布式系统，在这一点上是完全一致的。听取久远的教诲，尊重古老的智慧，如今的架构师也会从中受益的。不信？我们就拿经典的三种编程范式来举例，看看这些“老掉牙”的玩意儿和如今的架构设计有什么关联。

**Choosing between Redux and React’s Context API**  
https://blog.usejournal.com/choosing-between-redux-and-reacts-context-api-272ca20224b2  
Now that I’ve tried Context, I see that in our case, things were already too complex to let Context manage the query params and help with serialization. I can, however, think of a few use cases. If you have a small app or reusable components that you open source, Context would be very useful. 

**Accurately measuring layout on the web**  
https://nolanlawson.com/2018/09/25/accurately-measuring-layout-on-the-web/  
The browser rendering pipeline is complicated. For that reason, it’s tricky to measure the performance of a webpage, especially when components are rendered client-side and everything becomes an intricate ballet between JavaScript, the DOM, styling, layout, and rendering. Many folks stick to what they understand, and so they may under-measure or completely mis-measure their website’s frontend performance. So in this post, I want to demystify some of these concepts, and offer techniques for accurately measuring what’s going on when we render things on the web.

**A Minimal JavaScript Setup**  
https://css-tricks.com/a-minimal-javascript-setup/  
In server-rendered world, where we work with content that's delivered to the browser from a server, this "framework mission" is filled with skills, ideas, and solutions that people share with co-workers, friends, and others. They tend to adopt consistent development rules and enforce them within their teams or companies, rather than relying on a predefined framework. For a long time, it’s been jQuery that has allowed people to share and reuse code on a global scale with its plugins — but that era is fading as new frameworks are entering the fold. Let’s take a look at some core points that any framework — custom or not — ought to consider essential for encouraging a maintainable and reusable codebase.

**The State of NoSQL with MongoDB and Node.js 2018**  
https://blog.bitsrc.io/the-state-of-nosql-with-mongodb-and-node-js-2018-690588c03650  
The NoSQL vs SQL database debate is very opinionated and a lot has changed over time. So, in this post, we will see what is the current state of different database strategies in brief and go into details of MongoDB and its connection with Node.js. In the end, you should be comfortable with the jargons of NoSQL and should be ready to start your journey with MongoDB and Node.js. 另附：[How Planable Uses Mongodb Atlas to Help Social Media Teams Move Their Creative Processes Forward](https://www.mongodb.com/blog/post/how-planable-uses-mongodb-atlas-to-help-social-media-teams-move-their-creative-processes-forward)、[SQL is neither dead nor a dinosaur.

**ES2018 - Unicode with Regex**  
http://www.discoversdk.com/blog/es2018-unicode-with-regex  
OK so, this is something pretty cool that we can do with regular expressions aka RegEx, and kinda blew my mind. Yes, but is it something worthwhile to learn you ask? Not only is it worthwhile to learn, it’s even fun! So shall we get started? Yes we shall.

**Modeling Uncertainty With Reactive DDD**  
https://www.infoq.com/articles/modeling-uncertainty-reactive-ddd  
Reactive is a big thing these days, and I'll explain later why it's gaining a lot of traction. What I think is really interesting is that the way DDD was used or implemented, say back in 2003, is quite different from the way that we use DDD today.

**Upgrading GitHub from Rails 3.2 to 5.2**  
https://githubengineering.com/upgrading-github-from-rails-3-2-to-5-2/  
On August 15th GitHub celebrated a major milestone: our main application is now running on the latest version of Rails: 5.2.1! In total the project took a year and a half to upgrade from Rails 3.2 to Rails 5.2. Along the way we took time to clean up technical debt and improve the overall codebase while doing the upgrade. Below we’ll talk about how we upgraded Rails, lessons we learned and whether we’d do it again.

**How we rolled out one of the largest Python 3 migrations ever**  
https://blogs.dropbox.com/tech/2018/09/how-we-rolled-out-one-of-the-largest-python-3-migrations-ever/  
Though we’ve relied on Python 2 for many years (most recently, we used Python 2.7), we began moving to Python 3 back in 2015. This transition is now complete: If you’re using Dropbox today, the application is powered by a Dropbox-customized variant of Python 3.5. This post is the first in a series that explores how we planned, executed, and rolled out one of the largest Python 3 migrations ever.

https://ai.googleblog.com/2018/09/building-google-dataset-search-and.html  
Google Dataset Search is a search engine across metadata for millions of datasets in thousands of repositories across the Web. In this post, we go into some detail of how Dataset Search is built, outlining what we believe will help develop an open data ecosystem, and we also address the question that we received frequently since the Dataset Search launch, "Why is my dataset not showing up in Google Dataset Search?”

**How to Build a Low-tech Website?**  
https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/2018/09/how-to-build-a-lowtech-website/

**Stack Overflow is 10!**  
https://stackoverflow.blog/2018/09/27/stack-overflow-is-10/  
And since 2007, those answers have been found 12.3 billion times by developers in need. We estimate that’s saved developers roughly 3.1 billion hours. But the big numbers don’t tell the real story. Every one of those times someone finds help is a developer who nails their initial project at their first job. Or a teenager who finishes her first project – the one that makes her realize she wants to be a developer when she grows up.

**Motion design doesn’t have to be hard**  
https://medium.com/google-design/motion-design-doesnt-have-to-be-hard-33089196e6c2  
Motion helps make UIs expressive and easy to use. Despite having so much potential, motion is perhaps the least understood of all the design disciplines. This may be due to it being one of the newer members of the UI design family. Visual and interaction design dates back to early GUIs, but motion had to wait for modern hardware to render animation smoothly.
