## 深阅读

**Rethinking Unit Test Assertions**  
https://medium.com/javascript-scene/rethinking-unit-test-assertions-55f59358253f  
The problem with most test frameworks is that they’re so busy making it easy for you to take shortcuts with their “convenient” assertions that they forget that the biggest value of a test is realized when the test fails. At the failure stage, the convenience of writing the test matters a lot less than how easy it is to figure out what went wrong when we read the test.

**12 Factor CLI Apps**  
https://medium.com/@jdxcode/12-factor-cli-apps-dd3c227a0e46  
At Heroku, we’ve come up with a methodology called the 12 factor app. It’s a set of principles designed to make great web applications that are easy to maintain. In that spirit, here are 12 CLI factors to keep in mind when building your next CLI application. Following these principles will offer CLI UX that users will love.

**Start Performance Budgeting**  
https://addyosmani.com/blog/performance-budgets/  
If you're building a web experience and want to stay fast, a performance budget can be critical. For success, embrace performance budgets and learn to live within them. Network & CPU limits on mobile can require asking hard questions like, "what is really important to my users?"

**The Suspense is Killing Redux**  
https://medium.com/@ryanflorence/the-suspense-is-killing-redux-e888f9692430  
At my latest workshops I’ve been getting this question: So does Suspense kill Redux? First, that’s a rude way to put it. But I get it, the suspense is killing you — or maybe Redux.

**[译]再见，面向对象编程**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzU0Nzk1MTg5OA==&mid=2247483877&idx=1&sn=39cc95efadec791b8ca572e27d94ef92  
几十年来，我一直都在使用面向对象语言编程。 我使用的第一个面向对象语言是C ++，接着是Smalltalk，最后是.NET和Java。我曾经是面向对象三大范式：继承，封装和多态，狂热的拥趸者，为他们的所带来的遍历疯狂。我渴望得到它（面向对象）所承诺的重用性，并期待自己能站在前人的肩膀上，进入这块全新、美好的土地。一想到只要将现实世界的物体映射到他们对应的类中，他们就能整齐的找到自己的位置，我就无法抑制自己的兴奋。但“我不能错的更多”。

**前端安全系列之二：如何防止CSRF攻击**  
https://tech.meituan.com/fe_security_csrf.html  
相比XSS，CSRF的名气似乎并不是那么大，很多人都认为“CSRF不具备那么大的破坏性”。真的是这样吗？接下来，我们还是有请小明同学再次“闪亮”登场。

**精致化的微前端开发之旅**

本文我将给大家破解深拷贝的谜题，由浅入深，环环相扣，总共涉及4种深拷贝方式，每种方式都有自己的特点和个性。

**Why We Decided to Rewrite Uber’s Driver App**  
https://eng.uber.com/rewrite-uber-carbon-app/  
This article is the first in a series covering how Uber’s mobile engineering team developed the newest version of our driver app, codenamed Carbon, a core component of our ridesharing business. Among other new features, the app lets our population of over three million driver-partners find fares, get directions, and track their earnings. We began designing the new app in conjunction with feedback from our driver-partners in 2017, and began rolling it out for production in September 2018.

**Understanding the difference between grid-template and grid-auto**  
https://bitsofco.de/understanding-the-difference-between-grid-template-and-grid-auto/  
To summarize, the grid-template-* properties are used to create, place, and size cells for the explicit grid. Any cell that exists in the grid that is not explicitly created by this property forms part of the implicit grid, which can be sized by the grid-auto-* properties.

**Why we need the distributed web**  
https://www.ctrl.blog/entry/the-dweb  
The distributed web seeks to make peer-to-peer content distribution the new default. This should help make the web topology more democratic and resilient to nature and political whims.

**Infrastructure as Code - Getting Started with Terraform**

**Dropbox traffic infrastructure: Edge network**  
https://blogs.dropbox.com/tech/2018/10/dropbox-traffic-infrastructure-edge-network/  
Dropbox has more than half a billion registered users who trust us with exabytes of data and petabytes of corresponding metadata. For the Traffic team this means millions of HTTP requests and terabits of traffic. To support all of that we’ve built an extensive network of points of presence (PoPs) around the world that we call Edge. 另附 Dropbox 的 [Using machine learning to index text from billions of images](https://blogs.dropbox.com/tech/2018/10/using-machine-learning-to-index-text-from-billions-of-images/)

**Applying machine intelligence to GitHub security alerts**  
https://blog.github.com/2018-10-09-applying-machine-intelligence-to-security-alerts/  
We created a machine learning model that scans text associated with public commits (the commit message and linked issues or pull requests) to filter out those related to possible security upgrades. With this smaller batch of commits, the model uses the diff to understand how required version ranges have changed.

**Writing system software: code comments**  
http://antirez.com/news/124  
In this post I analyze Redis comments, trying to categorize them.  Along the way I try to show why, in my opinion, writing comments is of paramount importance in order to produce good code, that is maintainable in the long run and understandable by others and by the authors during modifications and debugging activities.

While the world’s data doubles each year, CPU computing has hit a brick wall with the end of Moore’s law. For this reason, scientific computing and deep learning have turned to NVIDIA GPU acceleration. Data analytics and machine learning haven’t yet tapped into the GPU as systematically. That’s changing.

世间人生百态，许多意见会误导你的人生，经历一次次的吃亏是福，终于到一个节点上你意识到，水往低处流，能量向居下的人聚集。甘居后者反而领先，甘居下者反而为上，谦卑，敬畏，居下，开放，包容，是成就点事最重要的品质。当然世界需要你独一无二的价值！这时，你就走上了回归的道路，回归你真正的天赋天性，回归你为人类创造价值的初心。另附：[异类华为](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/dC_rHsDn5KCOF9PjwCUJsg).

**It doesn't have to be crazy at work**  
https://basecamp.com/books/calm  
[阮老师推荐](http://www.ruanyifeng.com/blog/2018/10/weekly-issue-26.html)的这本书蛮不错的。是不是一定要那么多加班？这本书说，也不是。加班多的一个因素是，公司没有好好珍惜员工的时间，打断工作的事情特别多，最典型的举措就是开放式办公室，使得人们互相干扰，员工因此不得不加班，因为在正常时间内无法完成工作。作者认为，公司应该创造条件，让员工全身心投入工作，不要拖到夜深人静时才能没有打扰。同时，这本书也指出，IT 公司的工作任务也确实过多：无休止的需求、不断的营销活动、精确到小时的排期，都给工程师带来了焦虑和压力。普通的行业，用户一年增长一倍，绝对是值得庆祝的，但是 IT 行业不行。这个行业渴望的是一年增长十倍，甚至百倍，要的是从0变成独角兽的那种速度。这本书的主张是，软件行业也可以是一个平静的行业，而不一定像现在这样，是一个加速再加速的行业。平静才是长期可持续发展的关键。另附：[来自Y Combinator的一份40岁的人生建议](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/qiw9egPTsQpAmEAjORrWjw).
