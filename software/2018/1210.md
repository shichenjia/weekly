**Flutter 1.0: Google’s Portable UI Toolkit**  
https://developers.googleblog.com/2018/12/flutter-10-googles-portable-ui-toolkit.html  
We're announcing [Flutter 1.0](https://flutter.io/), the first stable release of Google's UI toolkit for creating beautiful, native experiences for iOS and Android from a single codebase. Cross-platform mobile development today is full of compromise. Developers are forced to choose between either building the same app multiple times for multiple operating systems, or to accept a lowest common denominator solution that trades native speed and accuracy for portability. With Flutter, we believe we have a solution that gives you the best of both worlds: hardware-accelerated graphics and UI, powered by native ARM code, targeting both popular mobile operating systems. 另附：[Hummingbird: Building Flutter for the Web](https://medium.com/flutter-io/hummingbird-building-flutter-for-the-web-e687c2a023a8).

**Angular Console: What is it and why is it valuable for you?**  
https://blog.angular.io/angular-console-21d36c02ff76  
When trying to learn or design a piece of software, I believe the most important place to start is to concretely define a mental model of what exactly that piece of software is attempting to convey to its end user. So let’s start there, with an overview of Angular console’s current design and feature set. After that, we’ll move onto to a discussion of where the Angular team and Nrwl want to take Angular Console in the future.

**This year in JavaScript: 2018 in review and npm’s predictions for 2019**  
https://blog.npmjs.org/post/180868064080/this-year-in-javascript-2018-in-review-and-npms  
npm has over 10 million users who download well over 30 billion packages every month. On an average Tuesday—npm’s busiest day—users download more than 1.3 billion packages of open source JavaScript. This gives us a lot of information about what JavaScript users are up to. On top of that data, in partnership with the Node.js Foundation and the JS Foundation we survey of over 16,000 developers to ask what they’re up to. From these two sources, we’ve uncovered some insights about the makeup of the npm community, as well as information about what the community considers to be best practices. This will help you make your technical choices in 2019. 另附：[npm - 2018 JavaScript Ecosystem Survey](https://www.npmjs.com/2018-javascript-ecosystem-survey)、[Reddit’s Year in Review: 2018](https://redditblog.com/2018/12/04/reddit-year-in-review-2018/)、[Top 10 Algorithmia Blog Posts of 2018](https://blog.algorithmia.com/top-10-algorithmia-blog-posts-of-2018/)

**技术十年：美团第一位前端工程师潘魏增**  
https://tech.meituan.com/renwuzhi_panweizeng.html  
从饭否到美团，潘魏增用十年的技术生涯，诠释了“长期有耐心”这句话的含义。在他看来，长期有耐心，其实也是延迟满足感。对从事的行业来讲，我们要把眼光放得更长远一些，十年后才有回报的生意，往往都是大买卖。对个人来讲，不要把职位、职级这些虚的东西看得过重，关键看我们自己在其中承担什么角色，看我们自己的能力是否还有成长的空间。

**Inside Fiber: in-depth overview of the new reconciliation algorithm in React**

**QUIC and HTTP/3 : Too big to fail?!**  
https://calendar.perfplanet.com/2018/quic-and-http-3-too-big-to-fail/  
This post takes a (nuanced) “devil’s advocate” viewpoint and looks at how QUIC and HTTP/3 might still fail in practice, despite the large amount of current enthusiasm. In all fairness, I will also mention counter arguments to each point and let the reader make up their own mind, hopefully after plenty of additional discussion. 另附：[HTTP/2 Prioritization](https://calendar.perfplanet.com/2018/http2-prioritization/)、[HTTP/2 and the HOL in the Waterfall](https://calendar.perfplanet.com/2018/http2-hol-waterfall/)

**Serverless SSR: A Case Study**  
https://zeit.co/blog/serverless-ssr  
One of the most fascinating use-cases for such functions is server-side rendering (SSR). In other words, when visitors or search engines go to your web app, they can receive everything they need in just one network hop. In most front-end circles, a User Interface is described as a function of the state of an application: UI = F(S) is a relatively common equation among UI engineers. With SSR, UI essentially becomes a cloud function of the app's data.

**Cache warming: Agility for a stateful service**  
https://medium.com/netflix-techblog/cache-warming-agility-for-a-stateful-service-2d3b1da82642  
In this blog, we discussed the architecture of our cache warming infrastructure. The flexible cache warming architecture allowed us to copy data from existing replicas to one more new replicas and warm up nodes that were terminated or replaced due to hardware issues. Our architecture also enabled us to control the pace of cache warmup due to the loose coupling between the cache Dumper and Populator and various configurable tune-up settings. We have been using cache warmer to scale & warm up the caches for a few months now and we plan to extend it to support other systems.

**Managing Real-time Event Streams and SQL Analytics with Apache Kafka on Heroku, Amazon Redshift, and Metabase**

In this post, we’ll show you how to build a system using Apache Kafka on Heroku to manage and visualize event streams from any type of data producer. We’ll also see how you can build consumers that can push those event streams from Heroku into Amazon Redshift for further analysis using Metabase, an open source product analytics tool.

**How Airbnb is Moving 10x Faster at Scale with GraphQL and Apollo**  
https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/how-airbnb-is-moving-10x-faster-at-scale-with-graphql-and-apollo-aa4ec92d69e2  
Much more important than any one of these tricks is the broader point about moving exceptionally fast and automating as much of the process as possible, particularly around boilerplate, types, and file creation. Apollo CLI takes care of all the Apollo-specific domain, which free you up to wire those utilities up in a way that makes sense for your use case.

**The Great Migration: From Monolith to Service-oriented**  
https://www.infoq.com/presentations/airbnb-soa-migration

**Back to the Future with Relational NoSQL**  
https://www.infoq.com/articles/relational-nosql-fauna  
The database world is undergoing a renaissance as the primitives of the legacy RDBMS (ACID transactions, relations, constraints, normalized modeling) are being rebuilt for a distributed world.These new systems are technically CP, not AP, but are extremely fault-tolerant.Most of these systems rely on Google’s Spanner or Percolator protocols, which use two-phase locking and require physically synchronized clocks to guarantee consistency.Some systems, like FaunaDB, take a pre-commit approach based on the Calvin protocol, which offers stronger guarantees without specialized hardware.In either case, systems developers no longer have to give up transactions to get scale and availability in the real world.

**The two schools of thought in open source**  
https://staltz.com/two-schools-of-thought-in-open-source.html  
Open source means a lot of different things to different people. Naturally, when talking about open source, it will bring out different connotations depending on who you’re talking to. But there is another dimension to open source that is not often acknowledged: monolithic style versus modular style of open sourcing reusable code. I’ll explain the many differences between these two, but this is not an article about code, it’s an article about people and how they approach programming in different ways.

The W3C workshop will bring together experts in relational databases, property graphs, RDF/Linked Data, big data, and artificial intelligence and machine learning with a view to forging a shared vision for future needs for graph data, and alignment on graph data query languages. We will discuss what’s needed for positioning RDF as an interchange format between different graph database solutions, making RDF easier to use by the vast majority of developers, and opportunities for blending symbolic and statistical approaches for tackling the challenges of real-world data that is incomplete, uncertain, inconsistent and includes errors.

**IntelliCode for TypeScript/JavaScript**  
https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/typescript/2018/12/05/intellicode-for-typescript-javascript/  
IntelliCode augments your IntelliSense by recommending commonly used completion items for your current context at the top of your list. These contextual recommendations are generated by common practices learned from having IntelliCode train across thousands of real-world projects. This saves you time by putting what you’re most likely to use at the top of your list, so you don’t have to search though alphabetical suggestions. 另附：[PM2 Explorer - Manage PM2 from within VSCode](https://github.com/alsiola/pm2-explorer).

**A Programmer’s Introduction to Mathematics**  
https://jeremykun.com/2018/12/01/a-programmers-introduction-to-mathematics/  
For the last four years I’ve been working on a book for programmers who want to learn mathematics. The website for the book is [pimbook.org](https://pimbook.org/). If you’re a programmer who wants to learn math, this book is written specifically for you! Why? Because programming and math are naturally complementary, and programmers have a leg up in learning math. Many of the underlying modes of thought in mathematics are present in programming, or are otherwise easy to explain by analogies and contrasts to familiar concepts in software.

**Scaling engineering organizations**  
https://stripe.com/atlas/guides/scaling-eng  
At Stripe, we think a lot about scale. As we’ve scaled our products to process billions of dollars a year for millions of businesses, we’ve also needed to scale our engineering team. There’s a temptation for fast-growing companies to build their engineering team as quickly as possible. However, there are risks with rapid growth that include creating silos, diminishing user impact per engineer over time, and limiting ability to change how you work quickly to respond to changing user needs. This guide talks through some of the things we’ve learned along the way.

**从超级入口到超级接口，从超级APP到超级API**

有一定实力的互联网公司来说，它们都在经历一个相似的业务重点转移过程——从超级入口到超级接口，从超级APP到超级API。其根本原因是舞台换了，主角也得换。在“互联网上半场”，即以手机为主流终端的移动互联网时期，绝对主角是超级APP，核心矛盾是对日活、月活、用户使用时长的争夺。而到了“下半场”，即各类智能终端百花齐放、交互方式融入生活多元场景的物联网时期，新主角很可能是“超级接口”。

国家提出科教兴国战略已有23年，在收入水平提高和消费分级趋势影响下，今天的中国消费者对于下一代的教育投入正在不断走高。这不仅取决于商业资源分配结构变化之下家庭在提升生活品质方面的阔绰出手——下一代的教育消费当然是在为了更好的明天而花钱。另一方面，科技的不断进步为教育发展提供了更多可能，包括打破传统教育行业的时空限制，优化教育资源输送和配置等等。12月3日，GES 2018未来教育大会正式召开，「教育与科技」作为核心议题之一，被来自海内外学术、教育与科技行业近2000位嘉宾们的关注和探讨。另附：[科技、开放、普惠，未来教育的关键词都在这了](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MjM5NzY2OTE2MQ==&mid=2652220416&idx=1&sn=7c7451abf8363443696c427844b5cf20).

企业家就是要面对不确定性，把握机遇，把不确定性变成确定性。宏观跟你没有多大关系，我们担心的90%和宏观有关系，但是90%的宏观和你都没关系。把对手看得强大一点，永远不是坏事。好未必是好，坏未必是坏，关键是企业家自己的判断。只有担当更多的责任，才会受人尊重，做事情的时候，才有根有据。越是形势不好，我们越是要有战略定力，不要去投机。
