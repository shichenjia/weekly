**What, exactly, is the DOM?**  
https://bitsofco.de/what-exactly-is-the-dom/  
The Document Object Model, or the “DOM”, is an interface to web pages. It is essentially an API to the page, allowing programs to read and manipulate the page’s content, structure, and styles. Let’s break this down. 另附：[A look at CSS Resets in 2018](https://bitsofco.de/a-look-at-css-resets-in-2018/).

**The Art of Mathematics: A Mandala Maker Tutorial**  
https://24ways.org/2018/the-art-of-mathematics/  
In front-end development, there’s often a great deal of focus on tools that aim to make our work more efficient. But what if you’re new to web development? When you’re just starting out, the amount of new material can be overwhelming, particularly if you don’t have a solid background in Computer Science. But the truth is, once you’ve learned a little bit of JavaScript, you can already make some pretty impressive things.

**The subtle art of code golf in Javascript**  
https://www.lesscake.com/code-golf-javascript  
The goal of "code golf" is to reduce the size of a program as much as possible. It's a fascinating practice that I knew very little about. To change that, I recently challenged myself to code golf a simple Javascript program. In this article I'm sharing the program I wrote, and the 5 main stages I went through to make it much shorter. This should give an overview of the main techniques used to code golf in Javascript.

**HTTP_3 Explained**  
https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2018/11/26/http3-explained/

**Is there a better way to document complex software architectures?**  
https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18508284  
So much craft has been put into better languages, better compilers, and better IDEs for the software developer, I'm absolutely confused - where is the modern 'IDE' for the Software Architect?

**Go 2, here we come!**  
https://blog.golang.org/go2-here-we-come  
A major difference between Go 1 and Go 2 is who is going to influence the design and how decisions are made. Go 1 was a small team effort with modest outside influence; Go 2 will be much more community-driven. After almost 10 years of exposure, we have learned a lot about the language and libraries that we didn’t know in the beginning, and that was only possible through feedback from the Go community. 另附：[知乎社区核心业务 Golang 化实践](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/48039838)。

Over the last few years, I've been working with the Sass core team and Sass framework maintainers to create a proposal for a module system that's fit to replace @import. That proposal is now in a place that the core team is pretty happy with, at least as a starting point, so we want to open it up for community feedback.

**The Role of Color in UX**  
https://www.toptal.com/designers/ux/color-in-ux  
Understanding color psychology is a key aspect of creating a color palette that works well in digital design. While color is sometimes thought of as a purely aesthetic choice by some designers, it is, in fact, a key component of the psychological impact of a design on users, and as such, its UX. 另附：[Understanding color psychology though culture, symbolism, and emotion](https://uxplanet.org/understanding-color-psychology-though-culture-symbolism-and-emotion-215102347276).

**When Motion Creates Emotion**

In today’s context, flat design has hit its peak in terms of its ubiquity in interface design and designers have already started experimenting with how visuals can be made more appealing beyond sticking to just minimalism. Microsoft’s Fluent Design system is one example of a large tech company taking the lead in the next step of interface design. It combines what we love and what was helpful from skeuomorphic design with elements from minimalism.

**Does your Business Really Need a Mobile App?**  
https://blog.risingstack.com/does-your-business-really-need-a-mobile-app/  
Native mobile apps that focus only on one feature were okay, but they’re starting to become a thing of the past. Several new trends are going to make them obsolete: PWAs, superapps, chatbots and voice assistants. Creating a PWA is a great alternative for a general purpose application, and chatbots or voice assistants are very good for services like Uber or Lyft, but may not be suitable for everyone. The whole change-over is already happening, so maybe it’s time for mobile developers to add other technologies to their stack so that they can survive.
