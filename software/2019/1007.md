**Improving V8 regular expressions**  
https://v8.dev/blog/regexp-tier-up  
In its default configuration, V8 compiles regular expressions to native code upon the first execution. As part of our work on JIT-less V8, we introduced an interpreter for regular expressions. Interpreting regular expressions has the advantage of using less memory, but it comes with a performance penalty. In this blog post we describe how we take advantage of the upsides of interpreting regular expressions while mitigating the downsides.

**Preact X - Virtuous DOM and the Fragments of Suspense**  
https://github.com/preactjs/preact/releases/tag/10.0.0  
https://preactjs.com/guide/v10/whats-new/  
Preact X is the next major version of Preact fully packed with features like Fragments, Hooks, componentDidCatch, Test-Utils, Debug-Warnings, many compatibility fixes and so much more 🎉 It's finally happening! After months of hard work we've crossed the finish line and are over the moon with excitement to finally mark Preact X as stable. We'd like to thank everybody who tested it and submitted bug reports.

**Text Rendering Hates You**  
https://gankra.github.io/blah/text-hates-you/  
Rendering text, how hard could it be? As it turns out, incredibly hard! To my knowledge, literally no system renders text "perfectly". It's all best-effort, although some efforts are more important than others. The topics I focus on here have no particular rhyme or reason, they're just the ones that come to mind after a few years of working on rendering in Firefox. For instance, I don't spend much time talking about the challenges of text-segmentation or managing the different platform-specific text libraries, because I don't look at that much.

**HTTP的前世今生**  
https://coolshell.cn/articles/19840.html  
HTTP (Hypertext transfer protocol) 翻译成中文是超文本传输协议，是互联网上重要的一个协议，由欧洲核子研究委员会CERN的英国工程师 Tim Berners-Lee v发明的，同时，他也是WWW的发明人，最初的主要是用于传递通过HTML封装过的数据。在1991年发布了HTTP 0.9版，在1996年发布1.0版，1997年是1.1版，1.1版也是到今天为止传输最广泛的版本（初始RFC 2068 在1997年发布， 然后在1999年被 RFC 2616 取代，再在2014年被 RFC 7230/7231/7232/7233/7234/7235取代），2015年发布了2.0版，其极大的优化了HTTP/1.1的性能和安全性，而2018年发布的3.0版，继续优化HTTP/2，激进地使用UDP取代TCP协议，目前，HTTP/3 在2019年9月26日 被 Chrome，Firefox，和Cloudflare支持，所以我想写下这篇文章，简单地说一下HTTP的前世今生，让大家学到一些知识，并希望可以在推动一下HTTP标准协议的发展。另附：[Chrome - No More Mixed Messages About HTTPS](https://blog.chromium.org/2019/10/no-more-mixed-messages-about-https.html). 

**在 UC 做的前端工程化探索**  
https://lutaonan.com/blog/what-i-have-done-at-UC/  
我在 2016 年初加入 UC 的国际业务部，负责为 UC News 搭建运营后台。随着前端团队人数越来越多，我开始推动团队的前端技术栈统一以及前端工程化，开发了一个叫 Cans 用于快速搭建中后台前端应用的框架。直到了 2019 年我离开 UC, Cans 仍然服务于 UC 的国际业务。本文主要记录了我如何从 UC News 运营后台孵化出这个内部框架，以及其背后的设计理念。虽然 Cans 没有开放源代码。但我认为相比这些工具的源码，那些我在开发这些工具背后的理念、思考，更有被分享的价值。

**Want to Improve UI Performance? Start by Understanding Your User**  
https://engineering.shopify.com/blogs/engineering/improve-ui-performance-understanding-your-user  
I’ll dive into a few key areas that we found made the biggest impact on UI performance: How to assess your current situation and spot areas that could be improved; Prioritizing the loading of components and data; Improving the perceived loading performance by taking a look at how the design of loading states can influence the way users experience load time. Our team has always kept performance top of mind. We follow industry best practices like route-based bundle splitting and are careful not to include any large external dependencies. Nevertheless, it was still clear that we had a lot of room for improvement. The front end of our application is built using React, GraphQL, and Apollo. The advice in this article aims to be framework agnostic, but there are some references to React specific tooling. 另附：[Performance metrics for blazingly fast web apps](https://blog.superhuman.com/performance-metrics-for-blazingly-fast-web-apps-ec12efa26bcb)

**Middleware-based clipboard handling - meet clipboar**  
https://ckeditor.com/blog/Middleware-based-clipboard-handling-meet-clipboar/  
In the newest version of CKEditor 4, we introduced a new mechanism of handling pasting into the WYSIWYG editor that is provided by the Paste Tools plugin. It is based on a battle-tested idea of middlewares and simplifies the process of adding new paste handlers. We have decided to play around a little bit more with this concept and created a simple library for handling pasting and dropping content into a web page. Read on for more!

**Evaluating JavaScript code via import()**  
https://2ality.com/2019/10/eval-via-import.html  
The import() operator lets us dynamically load ECMAScript modules. But they can also be used to evaluate JavaScript code (as Andrea Giammarchi recently pointed out to me), as an alternative to eval(). This blog post explains how that works.

**I created the exact same app in React and Vue. Here are the differences**  
https://medium.com/javascript-in-plain-english/i-created-the-exact-same-app-in-react-and-vue-here-are-the-differences-2019-edition-42ba2cab9e56  
React vs Vue. Finally, a side-by-side code comparison between Vue and React! 🎉 [Updated and rewritten for 2019: Now with React Hooks] Having used Vue at work, I had a fairly solid understanding of it. I had, however, been curious to know what the grass was like on the other side of the fence - the grass in this scenario being React.

**Don't Sync State. Derive It!**  
https://kentcdodds.com/blog/dont-sync-state-derive-it  
The fact is that you can really simplify your app's state by considering whether the state needs to be managed by itself or if it can be derived. We learned that derived state can be the result of a single variable of state, or it can be derived from multiple variables of state (some of which can also be derived state itself). So next time you're maintaining the state of your app and trying to figure out a synchronization bug, think about how you could make it derived on the fly instead. And in the few instances you bump into performance issues you can reach to a few optimization strategies to help alleviate some of that pain. 

**Avoid 100vh On Mobile Web**  
https://chanind.github.io/javascript/2019/09/28/avoid-100vh-on-mobile-web.html  
Viewport units in CSS sound great. If you want to style an element to take up the full screen height, you can just set height: 100vh and voila - you have a perfect fullscreen element, which resizes as the viewport changes! Sadly, this is not the case. 100vh is broken in a subtle but fundamental way on mobile browsers that makes it nearly useless. It’s best to avoid 100vh and instead rely on javascript to set heights for a full viewport experience.

**How to detect machine-translated webpages**  
https://www.ctrl.blog/entry/detect-machine-translated-webpages.html  
There are two primary types of machine-translation services: proxy-based web-tools and web-browser based tools. The former type proxies pages through a translation-service and serves it up to the reader from their servers. These can be detected in JavaScript by reading the document.location property. The latter type is more difficult to detect as the text is translated and swapped in the web browser. However, these services can still be detected by looking for document object modification artifacts that create a recognizable fingerprint.

**Why is CSS so Weird?**  
https://hacks.mozilla.org/2019/10/why-is-css-so-weird/  
CSS is the design language of the web — one of three core web languages — but it also seems to be the most contentious and often perplexing. It’s too easy and too hard, too fragile and too resilient. Love it or hate it, CSS is weird: not quite markup, not quite programming in the common (imperative) sense, and nothing like the design programs we use for print. How did we get here?

**How CSS Grid changes the way we think about structuring our content**  
https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/css-grid-changes-how-we-can-think-about-structuring-our-content/  
With grid, we no longer have to rely on `<div>` s to create the structure of our page, or even a more complex component. The structure is literally defined by the parent and not how the content is organized within in. This means we can have nice, simple markup that sticks to the content itself without a reliance on organizing it through the use of `<div>` s. 另附：[Layout-Fun with CSS Grid](https://tobireif.com/posts/layout_fun_with_css_grid/)、[Editorial Design Patterns With CSS Grid And Named Columns](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2019/10/editorial-design-patterns-css-grid-subgrid-naming/).

**Build a PWA Using Only Vanilla JavaScript**

We have been trialling our [Mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) Monorepo plugin for several weeks with internal squads and we’re happy to share this in beta with the greater open source community. 

**How to Make Good Code Reviews Better**  
https://stackoverflow.blog/2019/09/30/how-to-make-good-code-reviews-better/  
Good code reviews are the bar that all of us should strive for. They cover common and easy to follow best practices that any team can get started with, while ensuring high-quality and helpful reviews for the long term. Better code reviews are where engineers keep improving how they do code reviews. These code reviews look at the code change in the context of the codebase, of who is requesting it and in what situation. These reviews adjust their approach based on the context and situation. The goal not only being a high-quality review, but also to help the developers and teams requesting the review to be more productive.

**OGL - Minimal WebGL framework**  
https://github.com/oframe/ogl  
OGL is a small, effective WebGL framework aimed at developers who like minimal layers of abstraction, and are comfortable creating their own shaders. With zero dependencies, the API shares many similarities with ThreeJS, however it is tightly coupled with WebGL and comes with much fewer features. In its design, the framework does the minimum abstraction necessary, so devs should still feel comfortable using it in conjunction with native WebGL commands. Keeping the level of abstraction low helps to make the framework easier to understand and extend, and also makes it more practical as a WebGL learning resource.

https://medium.com/google-design/the-obvious-ui-is-often-the-best-ui-7a25597d79fd  
Design clear interactions instead of clever ones, and users will follow. When we talk about common sense with product design, what we now see as strikingly obvious may not have been so apparent to designers when they first started. For a long time, designers have endeavored to make products as easy to use and navigate as possible. However, in order to highlight their products’ features, it has taken time for designers to understand users’ needs and challenges and iterate.
