**Scratch 3.0 is here!**  
https://scratch.mit.edu/discuss/topic/326861/  
With the introduction of Scratch 3.0 comes lots of exciting new features. There are dozens of new sprites, backgrounds, and sounds for you to play with. The brand new extension library lets you add new sets of blocks that connect to hardware and software services and do even more with Scratch.

**Monorepos: Please don’t!**  
https://medium.com/@mattklein123/monorepos-please-dont-e9a279be011b  
As is often the case in software engineering, we tend to look at tech’s most successful companies for guidance on best practices, without understanding the monumental engineering that has gone into making those companies successful at scale. Monorepos, in my opinion, are an egregious example of this. The frank reality is that, at scale, how well an organization does with code sharing, collaboration, tight coupling, etc. is a direct result of engineering culture and leadership, and has nothing to do with whether a monorepo or a polyrepo is used. The two solutions end up looking identical to the developer. In the face of this, why use a monorepo in the first place? Please don’t!

**Exploring React BDD using Gherkin syntax with Jest Cucumber**  
https://codeburst.io/react-behavior-driven-development-bdd-535afd364e5f

https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzU1NjUxNTkxMg==&mid=2247483709&idx=1&sn=0555c95330ddfcd0c266caed7b94f1ce  
在前端团队的工作，有一些出现频率很高的词：任务拆解、招聘面试、代码重构、技术规划、人员成长等等，阶段性总结，有做得好的、有结果不理想的，过程中也有很多事之间存在冲突，分析背后的诉求，有一个共同目标：提升团队产能，在资源有限的情况下，当前哪些事要做，哪些事可以不必做，团队产能如何提升，需要有更系统的思路和方法。

**[译]Redux作者从“UI工程要素”谈如何成为领域专家**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzU0Nzk1MTg5OA==&mid=2247484673&idx=1&sn=2056a95b60b9bc3b4739afc353564f7b  
如果你开发过用户界面，那么你可能直接或使用库来处理以下这些挑战。 无论是哪种情况，我都鼓励你尝试不使用任何库的情况下，独立创建一个小应用，并不断重构，解决问题。 任何一个问题都没有通用的解决方案，在探索问题和不同的权衡尝试之中才能学到东西。

**其实你并不懂 Unicode**  
https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/c_185117725

**Facebook - Open source year in review**  
https://code.fb.com/open-source/open-source-2018/  
At Facebook, we believe in the value of open source technology to achieve a shared goal of improving tools and frameworks used by the entire community. To continue our work toward that goal, we released 153 new open source projects in 2018. Our active portfolio (after removing or archiving outdated repos) contains a total of 474 projects. Collectively, these projects had more than 94,000 commits this year, nearly 28,000 of which came from amongst our over 2,700 external contributors. This healthy and vibrant ecosystem has grown to more than 1.03 million followers, including 257,000 new followers this year. 另附：[Data centers year in review](https://code.fb.com/data-center-engineering/data-centers-2018/).

**Start With a Website, Not a Mobile App**  
https://www.atrium.co/blog/founders-should-build-website-not-mobile-app/  
This article helps young developers reframe their approach to ideation and iteration. As a student, indie hacker, or side-project hustler, it’s fun to experiment with new ideas and launch concept quickly. But, in my opinion, starting those projects on the web will be faster and more likely to succeed than starting with iOS or Android.

**为什么有时候对产品钻研很深，却并没有带来好体验？**  
https://www.uisdc.com/the-curse-of-knowledge  
你是否碰到过这样的情况：你做了大量的研究，然后制定了一个完美的策划，但是你的顶头上司却因为没有Get到其中的重点而放弃了整个策划？又或者，你对用户的需求和习惯做了很多调查和分析，结果在此基础上开发的功能，用户并没有按照你的计划去使用它？或者，你根据客户的需求设计了一个兼顾形式和隐喻的LOGO，可是客户仍然不喜欢它，仅仅因为客户没有看出其中包含的诸多含义？如果是，那么你就是遭遇了一种名为「知识诅咒」的认知偏见。

**做会成功的设计**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/SUnXb0HJhS4owaPX2HR40A  
新手设计师们有时会遇到这样一种情况：自己负责设计一两年的产品，突然面临产品方向调整或者业务解散的情况。而作为设计师，我们大多是非常敏感且感性的，当遇到自己投入心血、付出感情的产品，面临这样的情况，大多会灰心丧气、怀疑自己，“为什么自己付出了努力和心血，觉得十分满意的设计，无法获得市场的认可，好好的活下去？“ 本篇文章，希望能够帮助新手或者不是新手的设计师们，尽量避免遇到类似的情况，让自己付出心血的产品，更长远、更好的活下去。

**Are Users Really Stupid?**  
https://uxplanet.org/are-users-really-stupid-92de6901e2be  
As a designer I heard numerous times that users are stupid. They don’t understand obvious things, they don’t read the instruction and so on. I bet you heard or even said this phrase too. What’s wrong with it? While it’s at least offensive to users, it’s also not true. Let’s uncover why we say so and why users aren’t stupid at all.

**Using Architectural History as a predictive model for the future of Product Design**  
https://uxdesign.cc/using-architectural-history-as-a-predictive-model-for-the-future-of-product-design-745b8848d77b  
From the early 90s through the 2010s, the emerging need to make digital software accessible to the masses propelled software designers, penned “UX designers” by Don Norman, to explore and develop focused design patterns that were functional and simple. Through heavy reductionism, user journeys were made to be as streamlined as possible, and the sole purpose of the interface was to guide users onto the next step of the journey.
