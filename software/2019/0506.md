**一个无名前端的10年前端路**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MjM5MTA1MjAxMQ==&mid=2651232157&idx=1&sn=375340129ea4caf9f68ab380b9b00382  
每每看到一篇类似10年总结的同行文章，仿佛都有一个人在问我：“你的10年怎么过来的？”，是啊，作为一枚寂寂无名的前端老菜鸟，我也是一天一天努力过来的，我的故事也有起承转合，我的人生未尝没有跌宕起伏。我的故事也许没有那么轰轰烈烈，兴许会有一点感同身受。

**爬取2000篇 Matrix 文章，这是一份可视化踹门教程**  
https://sspai.com/post/54169  
我们处在一个高度信息化的时代， 时刻都会在互联网上留下大量的访问痕迹——数据，小到日常的消费账单，大到一笔一笔的银行流水。这些留下来的海量数据无疑是对现实世界的简化和抽象表达，但对于大部分人来说，它们只是 Excel 里面的行行列列，不仅可读性差，而且晦涩难懂。如何提高数据的可读性，很大程度上取决于你看数据的方式，解读数据的方式。比如，我们可以将抽象的数据再抽象，经过二次抽象的数据变成了图表，反而可读性更高，更利于人们理解。提到数据可视化，Python、R、D3 甚至是 Excel，能够产生美妙图表的工具数不胜数，但它们大多都有一些技术门槛，要求你至少有一些编程基础，这对于非科班出身的人来说，并不友好。所以，我希望能减少对技术的依赖，去寻找一些优秀工具，同样能获得不错的可视化效果。

**Understand how to approach designing queues in Node**  
https://www.coreycleary.me/understand-how-to-approach-designing-queues-in-node/  
A new scenario you might not have faced before: you have a long running task (like saving to a bunch of different databases, or processing video) that takes a while to process and it’s currently causing your REST API response times to be way too slow for the end user. After some research, you’ve realized adding a queue to your architecture would solve your problem. The only problem is, working out how a queue actually works is confusing. In this post we’ll be going over the architecture for how a queue works (using the reliable queue pattern) so you can achieve exactly these things.

**The Many Benefits of Using a Monorepo**  
https://pspdfkit.com/blog/2019/benefits-of-a-monorepo/

**Using machine learning to predict what file you need next**  
https://blogs.dropbox.com/tech/2019/05/content-suggestions-machine-learning/  
Dropbox is building features to help users stay focused on what matters. Searching through your content can be tedious, so we built content suggestions to make it easier to find the files you need, when you need them. We’ve built this feature using modern machine learning (ML) techniques, but the process to get here started with a simple question: how do people find their files? What kinds of behavior patterns are most common?

**6 Technical Challenges Developing a Distributed SQL Database**  
https://blog.yugabyte.com/6-technical-challenges-developing-a-distributed-sql-database/  
We crossed the three year mark of developing YugaByte DB in February of this year. It has been a thrilling journey thus far, but not without its fair share of technical challenges. There were times when we had to go back to the drawing board and even sift through academic research to find a better solution than what we had at hand. In this post we’ll outline some of the hardest architectural issues we have had to address in our journey of building an open source, cloud native, high-performance distributed SQL database. Look for subsequent posts that will dive-deep into each respective issue. OK, let’s get started exploring these issues from easiest to most challenging.

**I/O Is Faster Than the CPU – Let’s Partition Resources and Eliminate (Most) OS Abstractions**  
https://penberg.org/parakernel-hotos19.pdf  
I/O is getting faster in servers that have fast programmable NICs and non-volatile main memory operating close to the speed of DRAM, but single-threaded CPU speeds have stagnated. Applications cannot take advantage of modern hardware capabilities when using interfaces built around abstractions that assume I/O to be slow. We therefore propose a structure for an OS called parakernel, which eliminates most OS abstractions and provides interfaces for applications to leverage the full potential of the underlying hardware. The parakernel facilitates application-level parallelism by securely partitioning the resources and multiplexing only those resources that are not partitioned.

**Python at Netflix**  
https://medium.com/netflix-techblog/python-at-netflix-bba45dae649e  
As many of us prepare to go to PyCon, we wanted to share a sampling of how Python is used at Netflix. We use Python through the full content lifecycle, from deciding which content to fund all the way to operating the CDN that serves the final video to 148 million members. We use and contribute to many open-source Python packages, some of which are mentioned below. If any of this interests you, check out the jobs site or find us at PyCon. We have donated a few Netflix Originals posters to the PyLadies Auction and look forward to seeing you all there.

https://blog.npmjs.org/post/184553141742/easy-automatic-npm-publishes  
One common question from people using npm to publish, especially on CI systems, is how best to automate the process, especially when dealing with multiple branches. For a while now, I’ve been using a pattern that takes almost all of the human interaction out of it, since I tend to mess stuff up when I type it with my fingers. This works well for automatic publishes from CI or when publishing manually from a terminal.

**Why Software Projects need Heroes (Lessons Learned from 1100+ Projects)**  
https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.09954  
A "hero" project is one where 80% or more of the contributions are made by the 20% of the developers. In the literature, such projects are deprecated since they might cause bottlenecks in development and communication. However, there is little empirical evidence on this matter. Further, recent studies show that such hero projects are very prevalent. Accordingly, this paper explores the effect of having heroes in project, from a code quality perspective. We identify the heroes developer communities in 1100+ open source GitHub projects. Based on the analysis, we find that (a) hero projects are majorly all projects; and (b) the commits from "hero developers" (who contribute most to the code) result in far fewer bugs than other developers. That is, contrary to the literature, heroes are standard and very useful part of modern open source projects.

**Mobile UX Design Principles and Best Practices**  
https://www.toptal.com/designers/mobile-ui/mobile-ux-design-principles  
Good design is good design, right? True, but there are specialized considerations that come into play depending on the medium for that design. Design principles for something like an app made to run on a desktop computer are usually slightly different from the most effective mobile UX design conventions.

**(Th)Inking with data — tapping into the potential of the digital pen**  
https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/thinking-with-data-tapping-into-the-potential-of-the-digital-pen/  
The digital experience doesn’t match the sensory aspect—the tactile, visual, and auditory feedback—of the analog experience. Affordability and reliability are also among the many reasons why people might choose pen and paper over the digital option. Instead of seeking to emulate the analog experience, our aspiration is to uncover the unique capabilities of the digital pen. Our research aims to give the digital pen superpowers for marking documents in ways that go beyond what is possible with physical pen and paper.

三年前, 开启了人工智能时代，“它能做的事越来越多，几乎所有的事都可以做”，这是一种普遍的看法。但是任何时候，如果一个事物当所有人都觉得它能做时，都有两个可能性：一是这个事确实太厉害了；再一个可能也发展到头了。因为所有人都看到的事，红利未必还能继续存在。这时恰是需要一个冷静的思考。换个角度来看，就是人工智能不能做什么。

腾讯的愿景是什么？做一个令人尊敬的企业，这是他自己的问题。但是它没有使命，没有明确提出要为社会解决什么问题。直到去年下半年腾讯架构调整后，马化腾对外讲话里多出一个使命，“公司的使命是利用数字创新提升人类生活品质。”，现在腾讯将公司的使命和愿景都统一成了一个词：科技向善。
