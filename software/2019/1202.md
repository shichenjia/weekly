**Faster JavaScript Apps with JSON.parse()**  
https://www.bram.us/2019/11/25/faster-javascript-apps-with-json-parse/  
Because the JSON grammar is much simpler than JavaScript’s grammar, JSON can be parsed more efficiently than JavaScript. This knowledge can be applied to improve start-up performance for web apps that ship large JSON-like configuration object literals (such as inline Redux stores).

**When your dependencies break your software, wouldn’t you like them to fix it?**  
https://blog.angular.io/how-we-use-angular-at-the-gdf-cd17807a9bd2  
We at Allianz Global Digital Factory (GDF) use the tooling of Angular to keep our ecosystem in sync. Our main asset is our user interface (UI) component library, that enables teams in Allianz to use ready made UI components for building their apps. The main techniques we use are Schematics and ng update. This is something already well established when using Angular itself (e.g., KLM story). Here we want to share our journey of utilizing such a tool stack for our Allianz ecosystem.

**The Benefits of Orthogonal React Components**  
https://dmitripavlutin.com/orthogonal-react-components/  
A key principle of a good design is the isolation of the logic that most likely will change: making it orthogonal. This makes your whole system flexible and adaptable to change or new features requirements. If the orthogonal principle is overlooked, you risk creating components that are tightly coupled and dependent. A slight change in one place might unexpectedly echo in another place, increasing the cost of change, maintenance and creating new features.

**[译]React过誉了吗？**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/15b8jzfeakj5PUAkSBpoaw  
当我也成长为老一代开发者，看过了那么多项目花开花谢，我再学习新技术时就不会把它们当成已有事物的终极解决方案了，而只会把它们看作是升级更新，并加入到我自己的知识库里。React 本身也不是全新的东西。它只是将 JavaScript、HTML 和 CSS 打包在一起的另一种途径。Angular 刚出来的时候用的也是这种方法，之前的 jQuery 也一样。业界永远都在追捧下一个热点，但最佳方法就是学习如何正确地编写代码，然后把这件事做好即可——因为不管现在的热点是什么框架、库、支架之类花哨的东西，都是无关紧要的。作为开发人员，你的水平取决于你能以多快的速度，凭借良好的编程基础来适应当前的需求和环境。

**心性：架构师的修炼之道**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzA5MTAxNDg0OQ==&mid=2247484336&idx=1&sn=9c3f88d10f6ac6d28b21d5b043e65e85  
怎么成为优秀的架构师？架构师的修炼之道究竟是什么？我的答案是：修心。心性，是架构师区别于一般软件工程师的地方。也是为什么他能够看到那么多人看不到的关键点的原因。架构师成长之旅，是心性修炼之旅。我们需要记得，并不是理解了架构思维的原则，就能够做好架构。架构之道，是虚实结合之道。理论与实践相结合。从实悟虚，从虚就实，运用得当方得升华。架构思维的感悟并不能一步到位，永远有进步的空间，需要我们在不断实践中感悟，升华自己的认知。

**别让自己“墙”了自己**  
https://coolshell.cn/articles/20276.html  
这篇文章就是要劝大家更为开放，让自己有更多的可能性，能到更高的层次，做更有价值的事，成为更强更好的人……当然，如果你觉得你只想做一个平凡人，也和本文并不冲突……另外你也不要觉得这篇文章是让你要成为一个精英，但你你一定要去摸高……这篇文章是告诉你一种面对人生的思考方式，在这种思考方式下，你会有更多的可能性，更大的场景……而不是直接把自己归到“平常人”，把自己“墙”了！

**拥抱云时代的前端开发架构——微前端**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/rYNsKPhw2zR84-4K62gliw  
微前端架构旨在解决单体应用在一个相对长的时间跨度下，由于参与的人员、团队的增加，从一个普通应用演变成一个巨石应用(Frontend Monolith)，随之而来的应用不可维护的问题。这类问题在企业级 Web 应用中尤为常见。另附：[使用 Angular 打造微前端架构的 ToB 企业级应用](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/ochbPM5f84u-1BcNRXVOLA)。

**美团外卖前端容器化演进实践**  
https://tech.meituan.com/2019/11/28/meituan-front-end-containerization-evolution.html  
随着业务的不断迭代，提单页的模块也越来越多，逻辑的耦合也越来越重。现在提单页的UI展示模块已经超过30个，这些模块的展示与否基本上通过服务端的下发数据来决定。在不同的订单类型下，提单页所展示元素的差异越来越大，很多模块的代码已经不适合统一放在一起维护，代码拆分的需求十分强烈。此外，客户端包体积是衡量客户端性能的重要指标，为了解决业务发展带来的提单页代码量急剧增长的问题，同时实现页面元素的动态配置，我们希望能够实现提单页的动态化，而动态化需要基于容器来实现，所以我们提出了提单页的容器方案。

**解密国内BAT等大厂前端技术体系-携程篇**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/IbORf-lQOLyaS8sBO5ILOw  
携程在组织架构上有基础研发团队进行保障，在大前端领域能够收敛、沉淀众多的基础平台服务、技术框架，形成了一套比较完整、统一的基础框架能力，很好的支撑了多App、多业务的快速发展。

**if 我是前端Leader，怎么走出小微前端团队的围墙?**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzI5MjYyODYyNQ==&mid=2247484073&idx=1&sn=5edc5544a38c6ada89f45d225b66a033  
小微企业的围墙不能靠一个人就能推倒，业务的扩张和升级才是真正的动力。如果你觉得你公司有上升的动力和势态，而且你认同公司的价值观，不妨一起努力推动公司的进步。反之，要认真考虑自身的发展。

**Copying code from Stack Overflow? You might paste security vulnerabilities, to**  
https://stackoverflow.blog/2019/11/26/copying-code-from-stack-overflow-you-might-be-spreading-security-vulnerabilities/  
We know that Stack Overflow is a daily part of a lot of developers’ lives. I’ve heard from multiple people that they come here daily (if not more often) to get answers to their questions. Sometimes the answer to a question about code comes as a chunk of code. And sometimes that code makes it into production applications because it answered the question perfectly. A group of researchers investigated these code snippets to see how secure they were, and if the security flaws that they introduced remained vulnerable in the project. Ashkan Sami, Associate Professor at Shiraz University, Foutse Khomh, Associate Professor at Polytechnique Montréal, and Gias Uddin, now Senior Data Scientist at the Bank of Canada, researched C++ code snippets on Stack Overflow to answer this exact question.

**Egnyte Architecture: Lessons Learned In Building And Scaling A Multi Petabyte Content Platform**  
http://highscalability.com/blog/2019/11/25/egnyte-architecture-lessons-learned-in-building-and-scaling.html  
Egnyte is a secure Content Collaboration and Data Governance platform, founded in 2007 when Google drive wasn't born and AWS S3 was cost-prohibitive. Our only option was to roll up our sleeves and build basic cloud file system components such as object store ourselves. Over time, costs for S3 and GCS became reasonable and with Egnyte’s storage plugin architecture, our customers can now bring in any storage backend of their choice. To help our customers manage ongoing data explosion, we have designed many of the core components over the last few years. In this article, I will share the current architecture and some of the lessons we learned scaling it along with some of the things we are looking to improve upon in the near future.

**5 Things I love about Strapi, a Node.js headless CMS**  
https://www.jsmonday.dev/articles/44/5-things-i-love-about-strapi-a-node-js-headless-cms  
One year ago I started sto develop the backend for the website you’re currently browsing on. I’ve tried different approaches, different technologies and even different programming languages. Then I started to look for a CMS that could help me to integrate a number of feature with ease… but I couldn’t find a CMS that satisfied me at all. Then I discovered Strapi, an amazing open source headless CMS that had everything I was looking for.

**CCSM: Scalable statistical anomaly detection to resolve app crashes faster**  
https://engineering.fb.com/developer-tools/ccsm/  
We employ rigorous code review and testing processes, but, as with any system, software bugs still sometimes slip through and may even cause our apps to crash. Resolving these crashes and other reliability issues in a timely manner is a top priority. To help us respond as quickly as possible, we have been creating a collection of services that use machine learning (ML) to aid engineers in diagnosing and resolving software reliability and performance issues. As part of this collection, we recently implemented continuous contrast set mining (CCSM), an anomaly-detection framework that uses contrast set mining (CSM) techniques to locate statistically “interesting” (defined by several statistical properties) sets of features in groups.

**Discovering Continuous Automation With Request Mirroring**

Because eBay's item page updates frequently, and because it depends on hundreds of libraries and services, discovering the unknowns and automating testing for all use-case combinations from production calls for a different approach to testing.

**Astrophotography with Night Sight on Pixel Phones**  
https://ai.googleblog.com/2019/11/astrophotography-with-night-sight-on.html  
This year’s version of Night Sight pushes the boundaries of low-light photography with phone cameras. By allowing exposures up to 4 minutes on Pixel 4, and 1 minute on Pixel 3 and 3a, the latest version makes it possible to take sharp and clear pictures of the stars in the night sky or of nighttime landscapes without any artificial light.

**Machine Learning on Encrypted Data Without Decrypting It**  
https://juliacomputing.com/blog/2019/11/22/encrypted-machine-learning.html?hn  
Recent breakthroughs in cryptography have made it practical to perform computation on data without ever decrypting it. In our example, the user would send encrypted data (e.g. images) to the cloud API, which would run the machine learning model and then return the encrypted answer. Nowhere was the user data decrypted and in particular the cloud provider does not have access to either the orignal image nor is it able to decrypt the prediction it computed. How is this possible? Let’s find out by building a machine learning service for handwriting recognition of encrypted images (from the MNIST dataset).

**Choosing Go at American Express**

Selecting a new programming language is an important decision for any organization. In this article, I’m going to walk through some of the reasons American Express elected to use Go within our payment and rewards systems. 另附：[From Java to Golang, the journey of the nexuzhealth team by Dylan Meeus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4dSw3tkclQ4), After 20 years of using Java to support the largest hospital network in Belgium, the decision was made to replace this system using a new technology stack.

**An Overview of Cryptography**  
https://www.garykessler.net/library/crypto.html  
Does increased security provide comfort to paranoid people? Or does security provide some very basic protections that we are naive to believe that we don't need? During this time when the Internet provides essential communication between literally billions of people and is used as a tool for commerce, social interaction, and the exchange of an increasing amount of personal information, security has become a tremendously important issue for every user to deal with. This paper has two major purposes. The first is to define some of the terms and concepts behind basic cryptographic methods, and to offer a way to compare the myriad cryptographic schemes in use today. The second is to provide some real examples of cryptography in use today.

**Is There A Future Beyond Writing Great Code?**  
https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2019/11/future-beyond-writing-great-code/  
Many developers get to a point in their careers in which they’ve achieved many of their goals and wonder about the future. Although some are confident continuing down the same road, others might feel the urge to explore different options in which their skills can be used to have a broader impact on the projects we work on and the teams we work with. I explored some of the different directions we can take and the complementary skills that can help us throughout our journey.

**An Engineering Team where Everyone is a Leade**  
https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/a-team-where-everyone-is-a-leader/  
When I moved from engineering to engineering management, I wanted to build a team where everyone can be a leader - and an owner. This post is a summary of the approach and tools I've used to build an engineering team, where everyone is a leader - including sharing of the project management expectations Google Docs guide that my team uses. It's also a reflection on the pain points that came with this approach. I can't advocate for how universally this approach could work. However, based on my results, it is something I suggest engineering leaders - especially frontline managers - consider as an option.
