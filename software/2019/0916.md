**A lighter V8**  
https://v8.dev/blog/v8-lite  
In late 2018 we started a project called V8 Lite, aimed at dramatically reducing V8’s memory usage. Initially this project was envisioned as a separate Lite mode of V8 specifically aimed at low-memory mobile devices or embedder use-cases that care more about reduced memory usage than throughput execution speed. However, in the process of this work, we realized that many of the memory optimizations we had made for this Lite mode could be brought over to regular V8 thereby benefiting all users of V8. In this post we highlight some of the key optimizations we developed and the memory savings they provided in real-world workloads.

**Don't get locked up into avoiding lock-in**  
https://martinfowler.com/articles/oss-lockin.html  
A significant share of architectural energy is spent on reducing or avoiding lock-in. That's a rather noble objective: architecture is meant to give us options and lock-in does the opposite. However, lock-in isn't a simple true-or-false matter: avoiding being locked into one aspect often locks you into another. Also, popular notions, such as open source automagically eliminating lock-in, turn out to be not entirely true. Time to have a closer look at lock-in, so you don't get locked up into avoiding it!

**Perspectives from Contributing to Angular**  
https://blog.angular.io/perspectives-from-contributing-to-angular-a3340a3b5585  
The Angular framework is easily the largest and most complex codebase I have worked with, and has taught me valuable ideas about software development. This post discusses what I’ve learned about understanding and working on large codebases, and how my confidence in open-source contribution has changed since working on Angular.

**[译]亚马逊 CTO 的“中台论”**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/1hBylosHWDo0y3TK0hNYig  
Werner Vogels 是 Amazon.com 的 CTO，他撰写了一篇文章，总结 AWS 这二十多年来，如何通过变革应用程序架构、调整企业组织架构等方式，让构建现代应用程序的客户“将更多时间花在定义业务逻辑上，扩展系统以轻松满足高峰期客户需求，提高敏捷性，同时更快、更频繁地向市场发布新功能”。在文中他提到亚马逊“庞大的整体式‘书店’应用程序以及臃肿的数据库极大限制了我们的速度与敏捷性。每当我们打算为客户提供新的功能或者产品，我们就必须在专为书店设计的应用程序当中编辑甚至重写大量代码”，将组织架构调整为小团队并“赋予他们对应用程序内特定部分的更多操作权限”，通过改变对技术的运用方式，业务交付速度提升非常明显，比如某汽车领域客户将将新功能的推出时间由六个月缩短至一周。这篇文章体现的，对比我们现在倡导的“中台论”，很多地方都不谋而合了。也可谓是亚马逊的“中台论”，虽然他们并没有使用这个词。

**[译]什么是真正的10x工程师？**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzUxMzcxMzE5Ng==&mid=2247492501&idx=1&sn=efb7e795fbefe3bf1ec5e71772736109  
那么，什么是“10x 工程师”呢？ Kirani 在 Twitter 上没有确切给出定义。我们假定 10x 工程师的生产率是普通工程师的 10 倍。在大家吐槽这个定义之前，我要澄清一下。我把输出作为开发组或团队的输出来进行测量，而不是作为个人的输出。因此，我对“10x 工程师”的定义是: 想较于公司雇用的其他人，10x 工程师能让团队的输出增加 10 倍。从 Twitter 上给出评估列表后，标识“10x 工程师”的方法发生了很大的变化。我用来标识 "10x 工程师"的 11 个方法如下。

**王者之战，下一代高性能跨平台 UI 渲染引擎**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzIyMjQ0MTU0NA==&mid=2247491762&idx=2&sn=20e7430a1184f5069a01ef412dc2e7b8  
本文主要阐述目前主流的跨平台渲染引擎以及目前关于渲染引擎的探索，目前各种渲染引擎并不是一成不变的，都在蓬勃发展。如 Blink 的 Slimming Paint 项目采用和 Native View 相同的策略， Render Layer 只输出 Display List ，由 CC 根据策略是采用 Layer Compositor 还是 Direct GPU Raster 思路？Firefox 的 WebRender 渲染引擎，尝试把 JS 的执行， Layout、Paint 的执行并行化，并采用更高级的 GPU 绘制元素的方式。相信未来一定会涌出不少优秀的跨平台 UI 渲染引擎。

**React's useEffect and useRef Explained for Mortals**  
https://leewarrick.com/blog/react-use-effect-explained/  
Sometimes the pantheon of React Gods have a hard time translating their wisdom into language the rest of us can understand. It usually goes like this: You hit a snag with React, google your issue, and read a blog or Stack Overflow post with some advice that makes you feel more lost than when you started.

**5G Will Definitely Make the Web Slower, Maybe**  
https://www.filamentgroup.com/lab/5g/  
So network performance stands to get much faster very soon. That should alleviate the web’s performance problems right? Well, it should, but I don’t expect it will. At least not soon. If recent trends continue, 5G just might make web performance worse, not better, for the average person.

**CSRF is (really) dead**  
https://scotthelme.co.uk/csrf-is-really-dead/  
A little while back I wrote a blog post about how "CSRF is dead". It focused on SameSite cookies, a powerful yet simple feature to protect your website against CSRF attacks. As powerful as it was, and as much as it will kill CSRF, you had to enable it on your site, and that was the problem. Now, we're solving that problem.

**Running GitHub on Rails 6.0**  
https://github.blog/2019-09-09-running-github-on-rails-6-0/  
On August 26, 2019, the GitHub application was deployed to production with 100 percent of traffic on the newest Rails version: 6.0. This change came just 1.5 weeks after the final release of Rails 6.0. Rails upgrades aren’t always something companies announce, but looking back at GitHub’s history of being on a custom fork of Rails 3.2, this upgrade is a big deal. It represents how far we’ve come in the last few years, and the hard work and dedication from our upgrade team made it smoother, easier, and faster than any of our previous upgrades.

**The Beauty of Functional Languages in Deep Learning — Clojure and Haskell**  
https://www.welcometothejungle.co/fr/articles/btc-deep-learning-clojure-haskell  
TensorFlow and PyTorch in Python are popular, as is the Keras package in R. However, in the production of deep learning systems, performance and safety are two issues that drive companies to choose functional programming languages such as Clojure and Haskell instead.

**Color Emulation**  
https://byuu.net/video/color-emulation  
Nearly all retro game systems generate colors in some variant of RGB encoding. But the raw pixel colors are often designed for very different screens than those that emulators typically run on. In this article, I'll walk through the importance of color emulation, and provide some example code and screenshots. The most common target display type these days are LCD panels. These are known for having very poor black levels. The distinction between TN, PVA, and IPS does not factor too much into this. Sometimes CRTs are used by enthusiasts, and OLED screens, especially on phones and tablets, are slowly becoming a thing. But for this article, the focus will be primarily on LCDs, though this technique is important for all display types.

**The Gradual Design System: How We Built Slack Kit**  
https://slack.engineering/the-gradual-design-system-how-we-built-slack-kit-8a2830484259
A group of engineers, designers, and writers began to centralize these standards, documenting the bits and pieces, small and large, that make up Slack. We named it Slack Kit. It’s an evolving internal resource containing everything from typography to accessibility patterns. It helps us keep the product as consistent and accessible as possible, while speeding up design and engineering efforts. And with the release of our new client, it’s now used throughout Slack. It’s a system that grew retrospectively, taking advantage of lessons learned from early feature implementations to inform the patterns we wanted to codify. This post is about how we built it.

**Stop Infinite Scrolling on Your Website - Now!**  
https://hackernoon.com/stop-infinite-scrolling-on-your-website-now-ie6rg31eu  
If you are still dilly-dallying on whether to use infinite scrolling or not, the only thing we would like to ask you is this- Does using infinite scrolling on your website put you at a great advantage vis-a-vis the normal interface with pagination? If the answer to the question is ‘Yes’, then please go ahead and use it. If not, do keep in mind that there are a lot of designing and application development challenges that are associated with this. If you are an eCommerce website, please don’t even think about using infinite scrolling. It can create a negative dent on your store’s traffic and sales.

**Don’t Listen To Customers – Why User Research Matters**  
https://www.toptal.com/designers/ux/why-user-research-matters  
“A lot of times, people don’t know what they want until you show it to them.” How many times have we heard customers tell us what they want, only to learn that it’s not really what they wanted? We end up confused and perplexed. This creates a problem. When we, as designers, do not challenge our clients’ responses in a thoughtful way, the entire product–and their business–can fail. But there’s a solution: in-depth user research focused on finding out what customers really want.
