**Technical lessons from building a compiler startup for 3 years**  
https://medium.com/@gabriel_20625/technical-lessons-from-building-a-compiler-startup-for-3-years-4473405161cd    
[Pagedraw](https://pagedraw.io) recently shut down and is [now open source](https://github.com/Pagedraw/pagedraw). Pagedraw is a UI builder like Sketch + a compiler that translates your designs into React code. Instead of doing a “It was an incredible journey, thank you so much everyone“ type of post, we think what would be the most helpful for other people interested in DevTools, programming, or startups in general is to just try to distill the most important lessons we learned doing Pagedraw over the past three years. 另附：[Launch HN: Pagedraw (YC W18) – Compile UI Mockups to React Code](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16467387)、[Pagedraw is shutting down and going open source](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19273403).

**Redis Turns 10 – How it started with a single post on Hacker News**  
https://redislabs.com/blog/redis-turns-10/  
10 years ago, a link was posted on Hacker News to a new software project called Redis. In the comments, its creator Salvatore Sanfilippo (a.k.a. antirez) says “one of the major points of Redis is to support more complex types as values”. From Day 1, Salvatore knew what he wanted to build. And to his credit, he stayed focused. Redis now has 10 complex types and a module system that enables developers to build more. And as a result, Redis is the most popular key-value store on the planet.另附：[Gopher: a present for Redis](http://antirez.com/news/127).

**Why we created npm Enterprise**  
https://blog.npmjs.org/post/183073931165/why-we-created-npm-enterprise  
Last week we launched [npm Enterprise](https://www.npmjs.com/products/enterprise), a fact that might come as a surprise to those of you who’ve been paying attention and know that we’ve had an enterprise product since 2014. The new Enterprise is a totally different beast, the result of recognizing that the way npm works is fundamentally new and different to previous package ecosystems.

**百度的春晚战事**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzU0NDEwMTc1MA==&mid=2247491861&idx=1&sn=5be51315f84079d798db03bf731ebd17  
无论悲喜，反正每个中国人都为春晚辟出了一块“专属记忆”。而从2015年开始，中国人的春晚记忆里被点上了一颗“红痣”。那就是——总有一家顶尖互联网公司面带羞赧地走上舞台，给十几亿人发红包。2019年，央视春晚红包招标时间很晚，距离除夕只有一个多月的时间。巨头们都觉得凶险异常，百度却高高举手：我来！我来！所有吃瓜群众都侧目，这种“情商低”的状态，还真是百度的风格。。。接下来中哥就告诉你，2019年2月4日除夕晚上，这片土地上究竟发生了什么。

**前端之未来**  
https://www.yuque.com/zenany/up/the_future_frontend  
Gartner 2018 年的一份报告中提到三项前端相关的战略技术：Digital Twin、Immersive technologies、Smart Spaces，但当下的前端技术远不足以胜任这些领域。站在 201X 的末尾、互联网下半场的开始，不妨一起看看前端的未来在哪里，有哪些值得投入的方向。

**Semantics to Screen Readers**  
https://alistapart.com/article/semantics-to-screen-readers  
Assistive technologies (ATs), which are hardware and software that help us perceive and interact with digital content, come in diverse forms. ATs can use a whole host of user input, ranging from clicks and keystrokes to minor muscle movements. ATs may also present digital content in a variety of forms, such as Braille displays, color-shifted views, and decluttered user interfaces (UIs). If you make websites, you may have tested your sites with a screen reader. But how do these and other assistive programs actually access your content? What information do they use? We’ll take a detailed step-by-step view of how the process works.

**Taming the front-end monolith**  
https://blog.logrocket.com/taming-the-front-end-monolith-dbaede402c39  
While larger back-end systems are usually split up in terms of responsibilities into what we call (micro)services, the client(s) consuming these services are still monoliths. In terms of debugging and coherence this must obviously offer some advantage, otherwise, such a concentration of knowledge seems inefficient and unmaintainable. In this post, I will try to tackle the problem with a solution proposal that works especially great for what I would call “portal-like applications”.

**Implications of Rewriting a Browser Component in Rust**  
https://hacks.mozilla.org/2019/02/rewriting-a-browser-component-in-rust/   
Due to the overlap between memory safety violations and security-related bugs, we can say that Rust code should result in fewer critical CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures). However, even Rust is not foolproof. Developers still need to be aware of correctness bugs and data leakage attacks. Code review, testing, and fuzzing still remain essential for maintaining secure libraries. 另附：[Super-fast javascript to javascript compiler written in rust](https://github.com/swc-project/swc) ，号称速度是 babel 的十六倍。

**Six tips for better web typography**  
https://css-tricks.com/six-tips-for-better-web-typography/  
How do we avoid the most common mistakes when it comes to setting type on the web? That’s the question that’s been stuck in my head lately as I’ve noticed a lot of typography that’s lackluster, frustrating, and difficult to read. So, how can we improve interfaces so that our content is easy to read at all times and contexts? How do learn from everyone else’s mistakes, too? 另附：[Typography for Developers](https://css-tricks.com/typography-for-developers/).

**Feross Aboukhadijeh, The Lost art of midi bringing back to the web**  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmfDMylKo5I  
In the days of Geocities and Angelfire, a quirky HTML tag called bgsound enabled sound files to play in the background of webpages. Usually, these files were in the MIDI format. What a glorious era that was! Sadly, bgsound has been removed from browsers and MIDI is obscure and hard to play back. In this talk, we'll bring MIDI and  bgsound back from the dead using WebAssembly, Emscripten, Web Audio, and Web Components. When we're finished, you'll be able to give your webpages the 90's treatment in a modern, standards-compliant way!

**Server-Side Caching in Expressjs**  
https://blog.bitsrc.io/server-side-caching-in-expressjs-24038daec102  
Caching has always been one of the many optimization tricks widely used in software development. In this post, we will look at how to enable server-side caching in Expressjs. Read on.

**ReDoS vulnerabilities in npm spikes by 143% and XSS continues to grow**  
https://snyk.io/blog/redos-vulnerabilities-in-npm-spikes-by-143-and-xss-continues-to-grow/  
Regular expression denial of service (ReDoS) attacks exploit the non-linear worst-case complexity vulnerabilities that some regex patterns can lead to. For a single-threaded runtime this could be devastating, and this is why Node.js is significantly affected by this type of vulnerability. We found that there were a growing number of ReDoS vulnerabilities disclosed over the last three years, with a spike of 143% in 2018 alone. 另附：[Top ten most popular docker images each contain at least 30 vulnerabilities](https://snyk.io/blog/top-ten-most-popular-docker-images-each-contain-at-least-30-vulnerabilities/)、[Node.js February 2019 Security Releases](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/vulnerability/february-2019-security-releases/)、[Breaking Down the MarioNet Service Worker Attack?

**Managing Uber’s Data Workflows at Scale**  
http://highscalability.com/blog/2019/2/25/design-of-a-modern-cachepart-deux.html  
At Uber’s scale, thousands of microservices serve millions of rides and deliveries a day, generating more than a hundred petabytes of raw data. Internally, engineering and data teams across the company leverage this data to improve the Uber experience. Application of this data spans several use cases, including calculating more efficient uberPOOL routes and making sure Uber Eats orders are delivered while the food is still hot, real-world events represented by data in our infrastructure.

**Rebuilding the Profile Highlights System at LinkedIn**  
https://engineering.linkedin.com/blog/2019/02/rebuilding-the-profile-highlights-system-at-linkedin  
One of the many ways to drive member conversations and active communities is through profile highlights, which are insights between the viewer of a profile and that profile’s owner. In this post, we will touch on why we decided to rebuild the backend system that supports this feature, its technological background, how we re-architected it, and the benefits and successes achieved thus far.

**Serverless Needs a Bolder, Stateful Vision**  
https://thenewstack.io/serverless-needs-a-bolder-stateful-vision/  
The Requirements of Serverless Are Evolving from the Infrastructure, up to the Application Logic. The enterprise is broadly replatforming data centers on containers, Kubernetes, and cloud-native frameworks in its orbit, and the adoption and momentum have been remarkable.

**MySQL Challenge: 100k Connections**  
https://www.percona.com/blog/2019/02/25/mysql-challenge-100k-connections/  
In this post, I want to explore a way to establish 100,000 connections to MySQL. Not just idle connections, but executing queries. 100,000 connections. Is that really needed for MySQL, you may ask? Although it may seem excessive, I have seen a lot of different setups in customer deployments. Some deploy an application connection pool, with 100 application servers and 1,000 connections in each pool. Some applications use a “re-connect and repeat if the query is too slow” technique, which is a terrible practice. It can lead to a snowball effect, and could establish thousands of connections to MySQL in a matter of seconds. So now I want to set an overachieving goal and see if we can achieve it. 另附：[ValuStor — a memcached alternative built on Scylla](https://www.scylladb.com/2019/02/20/valustor-a-memcached-alternative-built-on-scylla/)、[SageDB: a learned database system](https://blog.acolyer.org/2019/01/16/sagedb-a-learned-database-system/).

https://sites.google.com/a/athaydes.com/renato-athaydes/posts/fearlessconcurrencyhowclojurerustponyerlanganddartletyouachievethat  
In this article, we'll have a quick look at a few of them, from new to not-so-new languages. I don't intend to give an extensive analysis of each solution, or make a formal comparison between them. My intention is to simply explain the basics of each solution and how they can be used in practice (with code samples that show off what the result of using the models might look like), so that other developers may have an easier time understanding them and deciding which solution, or language, might be better applicable to their particular problems.

**Why Does Julia Work So Well?**  
https://ucidatascienceinitiative.github.io/IntroToJulia/Html/WhyJulia  
Julia is fast by design. Type stability and multiple dispatch is necessary to do the specialization that is involved in Julia's compilation to make it work so well. The robust type system is required to make working with types at such a fine level in order to effectively achieve type-stability whenever possible, and manage optimizations when it's not totally possible.

Mozilla crowdsources the largest dataset of human voices available for use, including 18 different languages, adding up to almost 1,400 hours of recorded voice data from more than 42,000 contributors. From the onset, our vision for [Common Voice](https://voice.mozilla.org/zh-CN) has been to build the world’s most diverse voice dataset, optimized for building voice technologies. We also made a promise of openness: we would make the high quality, transcribed voice data that was collected publicly available to startups, researchers, and anyone interested in voice-enabled technologies. 

**Announcing a New Management Structure for Ecma TC39**  
https://hacks.mozilla.org/2019/02/announcing-a-new-management-structure-for-ecma-tc39/  
In 2019, Ecma’s TC39 (the standardizing body behind JavaScript/ECMAScript)  will be trying something new. The committee has grown in the last few years. As a result, the requirements of running the meeting have grown. To give you an idea of the scale — between 40 and 60 delegates (and sometimes more) meet 6 times a year to discuss proposed changes to the ECMAScript specification. Since we have grown so much, we will be changing our management structure. We will move away from single-chair and vice-chair roles to a flat hierarchy with three chairs sharing the responsibility.

**React Native Open Source Update March 2019**  
https://facebook.github.io/react-native/blog/2019/03/01/react-native-open-source-update  
We announced our React Native Open Source roadmap in Q4 2018 after deciding to invest more in the React Native open source community. For our first milestone, we focused on identifying and improving the most visible aspects of our community. Our goals were to reduce outstanding pull requests, reduce the project's surface area, identify leading user problems, and establish guidelines for community management. In the past two months, we made more progress than we expected. 另附：[Choosing React Native For Your Mobile Tech Stack _ Ideamotive](https://ideamotive.co/react-native-development-guide/).

**Go 1.12 is released**

**Package Diff: A Way to diff npm Packages**  
https://diff.intrinsic.com/  
Package Diff displays a diff between two versions of the same npm package. Why not simply link to the GitHub repository of a package using two different version hashes? Well, the version of an npm package checked into source control isn't always the same as the version used inside of an npm package. This is commonly done for well-intending reasons, such as checking in raw source code but packaging a minified version. This is sometimes done for nefarious reasons as well, such as when a malicious package is published. 另附：[Introducing Package Diff](https://medium.com/intrinsic/introducing-package-diff-for-npm-e6487cc9b434).

**Zero Server - Zero configuration web framework**

It might be strange to think that we are in the middle of a great change right now. The generation before us is facing hard time using touch-screen mobile phones, and the generation after us is making robots. We are in the middle, dealing with everything like a mid-life crisis! But what will happen to UX ten years from now? Let’s look at some of the changes that may happen in merely a decade from now (this is just a personal forecast, and may or may not stand true!).

This article is an updated review of tools and software that I use to run my live coding stream each Sunday. If you’re interested in the original article, which offers some advice outside of tools and software, feel free to read it as well! When I wrote the original post, it was intended to be a “lessons learned” post, and I didn’t expect folks to use it as a real guide. Reflecting upon that, I’m going to share my current setup with more attention to detail this time, as I still get questions on a weekly basis from folks looking for more information.

**AR, VR & the Future of Learning**
