**On-Device, Real-Time Hand Tracking with MediaPipe**  
http://ai.googleblog.com/2019/08/on-device-real-time-hand-tracking-with.html  
We are announcing the release of a new approach to hand perception, which we previewed CVPR 2019 in June, implemented in MediaPipe—an open source cross platform framework for building pipelines to process perceptual data of different modalities, such as video and audio. This approach provides high-fidelity hand and finger tracking by employing machine learning (ML) to infer 21 3D keypoints of a hand from just a single frame. Whereas current state-of-the-art approaches rely primarily on powerful desktop environments for inference, our method achieves real-time performance on a mobile phone, and even scales to multiple hands. 另附：[Turbo, An Improved Rainbow Colormap for Visualization](https://ai.googleblog.com/2019/08/turbo-improved-rainbow-colormap-for.html)

**Using Native JavaScript Modules in Production Today**  
https://philipwalton.com/articles/using-native-javascript-modules-in-production-today/  
Two years ago I wrote about a technique—now commonly referred to as the module/nomodule pattern—that allows you to write ES2015+ JavaScript and then use bundlers and transpilers to generate two versions of your codebase, one with modern syntax (loaded via `<script type="module">`) and one with ES5 syntax (loaded via `<script nomodule>`). The technique allows you to ship significantly less code to module-supporting browsers, and it’s now supported by most web frameworks and CLIs. But now, thanks to some recent advances in bundler technology, it’s possible to deploy your production code as ES2015 modules—with both static and dynamic imports—and get better performance than all non-module options currently available. In fact, this site has been using real modules in production for months.

**WebAssembly Interface Types: Interoperate with All the Things!**  
https://hacks.mozilla.org/2019/08/webassembly-interface-types/  
Today’s WebAssembly, you wouldn’t want to use it in this way. You can run WebAssembly in all of these places, but that’s not enough. Right now, WebAssembly only talks in numbers. This means the two languages can call each other’s functions. But if a function takes or returns anything besides numbers, things get complicated. It should be possible to ship a single WebAssembly module and have it run anywhere… without making life hard for either the module’s user or developer. And with a new, early-stage proposal, we’re seeing how we can make this Just Work™. So let’s take a look at how this will work. But first, let’s look at where we are today and the problems that we’re trying to solve.

**Software Architecture Guide**  
https://martinfowler.com/architecture/  
When people in the software industry talk about “architecture”, they refer to a hazily defined notion of the most important aspects of the internal design of a software system. A good architecture is important, otherwise it becomes slower and more expensive to add new capabilities in the future. This page outlines my view of software architecture and points you to more material about architecture on this site. 另附：[Why Software Architects Must Be Involved in the Earliest Systems Engineering Activities](https://insights.sei.cmu.edu/sei_blog/2019/08/why-software-architects-must-be-involved-in-the-earliest-systems-engineering-activities.html).

**面向对象的编程：一场万亿美元级的灾难**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/o4cHtmhmoXpDdF6GclNx0g  
OOP被许多人认为是计算机科学界皇冠上的明珠，是编程部门的终极解决方案，可以消除我们的所有问题，是编写程序的唯一实际方式，是上天赐予我们的编程法宝......实则不是，人们开始无法忍受抽象和随意共享的可变对象组成的复杂图形。宝贵的时间和脑力耗费在了思考“抽象”和“设计模式”上，而不是解决实际问题。许多人批评面向对象编程（OOP），包括大名鼎鼎的软件工程师。就连OOP的发明者本人也猛烈炮轰现代OOP！每个软件开发人员的终极目标应该是编写可靠的代码。如果代码有缺陷且不可靠，其他一切都不重要。编写可靠代码的最佳方法又是什么？简单性。简单性是复杂性的对立面。因此，我们软件开发人员的首要职责应该是降低代码复杂性。

Taking a look at potential drawbacks of using Microfrontends and when it doesn’t make sense to adopt them.

**Iframes are just terrible. Here’s how they could be better**  
https://medium.com/@bluepnume/iframes-are-just-terrible-heres-how-they-could-be-better-974b731f0fb4  
In a nutshell: iframes let you build user experiences into embeddable ‘cross-domain components’, which let users interact with other sites without being redirected. There are a metric ton of awesome uses for that other than tracking and advertizing. Nothing else comes close for this purpose; and as a result, I feel we’re not using iframes to their full potential.

**How to build a plugin system on the web and also sleep well at night**  
https://www.figma.com/blog/how-we-built-the-figma-plugin-system/  
At Figma, we recently tackled one of our biggest engineering challenges yet: supporting plugins. Our plugins API enables third-party developers to run code directly inside our browser-based design tool, so teams can adapt Figma to their own workflows. They can enable accessibility checkers to measure contrast, translation apps to convert language, importers to populate designs with content, and anything else their heart desires.

**How to Build Good Software**  
https://www.csc.gov.sg/articles/how-to-build-good-software  
Software has characteristics that make it hard to build with traditional management techniques; effective development requires a different, more exploratory and iterative approach.

**Lesson Learned from Queries over 1.3 Trillion Rows of Data Within Milliseconds of Response Time at Zhihu.com**  
https://pingcap.com/success-stories/lesson-learned-from-queries-over-1.3-trillion-rows-of-data-within-milliseconds-of-response-time-at-zhihu/  
In this post, I’ll dive deep into how we managed to keep milliseconds of query response time over such a large amount of data and how TiDB, an open source MySQL-compatible NewSQL Hybrid Transactional/Analytical Processing (HTAP) database, empowered us to get real-time insights into our data. I’ll introduce why we chose TiDB, how we are using it, what we learned and best practice and some thoughts about the future.

**Serverless on GCP**  
https://bravenewgeek.com/serverless-on-gcp/  
GCP has a comprehensive set of compute options ranging from minimally managed VMs all the way to highly managed serverless backends. Below is the full spectrum of GCP’s compute services at the time of this writing. I’ll provide a brief overview of each of these services just to get the lay of the land. We’ll start from the highest level of abstraction and work our way down, and then we’ll hone in on the serverless solutions. 另附：[Google Cloud Run Button: 'Click-to-Deploy' for your Git Repos](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/serverless/introducing-cloud-run-button-click-to-deploy-your-git-repos-to-google-cloud).

**Redesigning our systems to provide more control over Off-Facebook activity**  
https://engineering.fb.com/data-infrastructure/off-facebook-activity/  
At F8 2018, we shared our plan to build a tool that would allow people to see the apps and websites that choose to share activity with us and to disconnect that activity from their accounts. Today we are beginning to roll out that tool, which is called Off-Facebook Activity. Building Off-Facebook Activity required an extensive redesign of the way our systems store and process this activity and new methods for disconnecting information about a person’s off-site activity from their account. 

**Building a universal search system for Pinterest**  
https://medium.com/@Pinterest_Engineering/building-a-universal-search-system-for-pinterest-e4cb03a898d4?source=rss-ef81ef829bcb------2  
As the types of content on Pinterest grow, our search results must adapt as well. Pinners can use filters to narrow down to the content type they want, but we can make the experience even better by predicting the most relevant answers for them. As a solution, we’re building a system to deliver content from various verticals within one integrated search results page. Today when you search you’ll already see these different types of formats (Video, Shopping, Pinners to follow). Over time these results will become even more personalized and relevant through advancements in machine learning ranking.

**Building the New Uber Freight App as Lists of Modular, Reusable Components**  
https://eng.uber.com/uber-freight-app/  
As Uber Freight marked its second anniversary, we went back to the drawing board to redesign its app. The original carrier app was successful for owner-operators with one or two drivers, but it wasn’t optimized for larger fleets—feedback we were hearing directly from our carrier base. It let carriers find and move freight from point A to point B, but did not support multi-stop loads with multiple pick-ups and drop-offs.

**YAML: probably not so great after all**  
https://arp242.net/yaml-config.html  
Don’t get me wrong, it’s not like YAML is absolutely terrible – it’s probably better than using JSON – but it’s not exactly great either. There are some drawbacks and surprises that are not at all obvious at first, and there are a number of better alternatives such as TOML and other more specialized formats. Personally I’m not likely to use it again when I’ve got a choice.

**monolith**  
https://github.com/Y2Z/monolith  
A data hoarder's dream come true: bundle any web page into a single HTML file. You can finally replace that gazillion of open tabs with a gazillion of .html files stored somewhere on your precious little drive. Unlike conventional "Save page as…", monolith not only saves the target document, it embeds CSS, image, and JavaScript assets all at once, producing a single HTML5 document that is a joy to store and share. If compared to saving websites with wget -mpk, monolith embeds all assets as data URLs and therefore displays the saved page exactly the same, being completely separated from the Internet.

**The Untapped Power of Vulnerability & Transparency in Content Strategy**  
https://alistapart.com/article/the-untapped-power-of-vulnerability-transparency-in-content-strategy/  
In marketing, transparency and vulnerability are unjustly stigmatized. The words conjure illusions of being frightened, imperfect, and powerless. And for companies that shove carefully curated personas in front of users, little is more terrifying than losing control of how people perceive the brand.

**4 Rules for Intuitive UX**  
https://learnui.design/blog/4-rules-intuitive-ux.html  
What I want to talk about today is four little rules that will help eliminate these pain points in your own designs. They’re the heuristics that are a level or two deeper than “use radio buttons if the user can only select one thing”. But, if you can remember to obey the things in this checklist, you’ll be that much closer to creating designs that your users can use easily right off the bat, freeing up your time for other, more important things. Here’s what we’ll be covering:  
- Obey the Law of Locality  
- ABD: Anything But Dropdowns  
- Pass the Squint Test  
- Teach by example

https://medium.com/microsoft-design/richer-relationships-with-people-centered-design-cd3dd16c6646?source=rss----71c99841f1ad---4  
People and relationships are at the core of everything we do in our lives, from grabbing coffee to starting a new project. Understanding our relationships to other people, and the relationships among people we know, is a key part of the human experience. Sharing these nuances of identity and relationships in the tools we use every day is the next step in reflecting reality in our digital lives.

人类的技术，从网站到交易系统，从城市基础设施到科学模型，甚至是为大型企业提供配套服务的供应链系统和物流系统，都已变得过于复杂且相互交错。为什么复杂的技术系统越来越难以理解了呢？我们应该如何看待这个复杂的世界呢？生物学思维和物理学思维是理解世界的两种方式，而复杂的技术系统更接近生物学系统，因此用生物学思维理解技术系统是个不错的选择。复杂系统研究专家塞缪尔•阿贝斯曼用《为什么需要生物学思维》这本书为我们提供了一个洞悉复杂世界的思考方式——生物学思维。生物学是一门能打通很多跨界知识的学科。相比物理学等自然科学，生物学更深刻地揭示了世界的底层规律，其思想放之四海而皆准。
