**The Future of React Router and @reach/router**  
https://reacttraining.com/blog/reach-react-router-future/  
We are bringing together the best of React Router and Reach Router into a new, hook-based API. React Router will be the surviving project. We'll introduce this API in a minor release (5.x). That means it's 100% backward compatible. (Don't forget, we recently released React Router v5, it was a major version change only because of a dependency version range issue, there were no API changes.) We will continue to support @reach/router 1.0 with bugfixes

**JavaScript Clean Code - Best Practices**  
https://devinduct.com/blogpost/22/javascript-clean-code-best-practices  
This is only a fraction of what you could do to improve your code. In my opinion, the principles alleged here are the ones which people often don't follow. They try to, but not always succeed for various reasons. Maybe at the start of the project, the code is neat and clean but when it comes to meeting deadlines the principles are often ignored and moved into a "TODO" or "REFACTOR" section. At that point, your client would rather have you to meet the deadline instead of writing the clean code.

**Truly reactive programming with Svelte 3.0**  
https://blog.logrocket.com/truly-reactive-programming-with-svelte-3-0-321b49b75969  
[Svelte](https://svelte.dev/ ) is a whole new way of building UI in a blazingly fast, efficient, and truly reactive manner, all without using a virtual DOM in fewer lines of code than you’d write with any other framework or library. That sounds all nice and good, but how is it different from the myriad of other JavaScript libraries and frameworks out there, you ask? I’ll tell you.

**Augmented Reality on the Web in 2019**  
https://www.sitepen.com/blog/augmented-reality-on-the-web-in-2019/  
The movement towards WebVR started with a report by the w3c, which later lead to implementation in browsers like Firefox and Chrome in 2017. The move to merge the work towards WebVR and WebAR came to a consensus as the Immersive Web Community Group, and work is now moving toward a new API called the WebXR Device API. With this brief history of Augmented Reality on the Web, let’s explore the current state of affairs for developers in 2019. 另附：[Walmart Labs - Build your first AR App](https://medium.com/walmartlabs/build-your-first-ar-app-3c9f682d4c89).

**San 为什么会这么快**  
https://efe.baidu.com/blog/san-perf/  
一个 MVVM 框架的性能进化之路。性能一直是 框架选型 最重要的考虑因素之一。San 从设计之初就希望不要因为自身的短板（性能、体积、兼容性等）而成为开发者为难的理由，所以我们在性能上投入了很多的关注和精力，效果至少从 benchmark 看来，还不错。

**长夜未央——企业级研发提效的下一阶段**  
https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/66474056  
研发效能提升，早已经不再是某个单一技术、某个研发环节提升就能产生收获的阶段。和历史上的其他生产活动一样，谁先察觉了质变的时机，谁先产生了质变，谁就拥有了降维打击一般的竞争力。不过从更长远的事件看来，软件生产仍然是人类生产活动中非常小的一部分，从全社会的角度去产生质变还有很长的路要走。 

**前端中台系统常见问题剖析与解决方案**  
https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/66413759  
在2019年5月11日的那个周末，我在FDCon 2019大会上进行一次有关中台领域的分享，分享的标题是《业务实现标准化在中台领域的探索》，并在现场发布了RCRE这个库，并介绍了如何使用RCRE来解决中台业务开发所面临的各种问题。会后看了一些同学的吐槽，可能是我分享方式的问题，使得当时并没有详细的阐述RCRE产生的背景和原因，以及当时所实际面临的痛点，而是仅仅去介绍如何使用RCRE了，难免也被冠以出去打广告的嫌疑。RCRE的诞生并不是一蹴而就，而是我在这个领域多年摸爬滚打的精华。它每一行代码都凝结着我从深坑中跳出来之后的思考，是下文介绍了所有问题和场景的解决方案。

**My experience moving from Enzyme to react-testing-library**  
https://medium.com/@boyney123/my-experience-moving-from-enzyme-to-react-testing-library-5ac65d992ce  
react-testing-library has changed the way I think about writing React tests. In this blog post, I will share with you my thoughts moving from Enzyme onto react-testing-library, what I experienced and why I would recommend react-testing-library going forwards.

**What does react-beautiful-dnd cost to maintain?**  
https://dev.to/alexandereardon/what-does-react-beautiful-dnd-cost-to-maintain-52e8  
The aim of this blog is to make visible the ongoing effort required to maintain the open source drag and drop project [react-beautiful-dnd (rbd)](https://github.com/atlassian/react-beautiful-dnd). The maintenance of the rbd project will look different to other open source projects, but I thought it would be insightful nonetheless. By exposing maintenance information I hope to dispell the myth that open source projects lead to less total effort then private source. There are huge advantages in open source, but the cost of ownership is not one of them.

**Folding the DOM**  
https://www.joshwcomeau.com/posts/folding-the-dom/  
I'd like to leverage that 3D engine to perform a neat trick: folding up an image.

**Why I think Flutter is the future of mobile app development**  
https://medium.freecodecamp.org/why-i-think-flutter-is-the-future-of-mobile-app-development-768332b73c0d  
With Flutter, the possibilities are practically endless, so even super extensive apps can be created with ease. If you develop mobile apps and have yet to give Flutter a try, I highly recommend you do as I’m sure you’ll fall in love with it as well. After using Flutter for quite a few months, I think it’s safe to say that it’s the future of mobile development. If not, it’s definitely a step in the right direction. 另附：[Flutter的召唤 |趋势背后的思考](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=Mzg2NTA4OTUwOQ==&mid=2247485441&idx=1&sn=dff85431e8f5565fb34d1bad9a2688ce)、[Flutter Web初体验](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MjM5NTEwMTAwNg==&mid=2650216360&idx=1&sn=12d3001cb9c4ec97eda2329b7f2cd7a4).

**Employing QUIC Protocol to Optimize Uber’s App Performance**  
https://eng.uber.com/employing-quic-protocol/  
The HTTP/2 stack fares poorly in dynamic, lossy wireless networks, and we learned that poor performance can often be traced directly to Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) implementations buried in OS kernels. To address these pain points, we adopted the QUIC protocol, a stream-multiplexed modern transport protocol implemented over UDP, which enables us to better control the transport protocol performance.

**Athena: Our automated build health management system**  
https://blogs.dropbox.com/tech/2019/05/athena-our-automated-build-health-management-system/  
At Dropbox, we run more than 35,000 builds and millions of automated tests every day. With so many tests, a few are bound to fail non-deterministically or “flake.” Some new code submissions are bound to break the build, which prevents developers from cutting a new release. At this scale, it’s critical we minimize the manual intervention necessary to temporarily disable flaky tests, revert build-breaking commits, and notify test owners of these issues. We built a system called Athena to manage build health and automatically keep the build green.

**Releasing Pythia for vision and language multimodal AI models**  
https://code.fb.com/ai-research/pythia/  
[Pythia](https://github.com/facebookresearch/pythia) is a deep learning framework that supports multitasking in the vision and language domain. Built on our open-source PyTorch framework, the modular, plug-and-play design enables researchers to quickly build, reproduce, and benchmark AI models. Pythia is designed for vision and language tasks, such as answering questions related to visual data and automatically generating image captions.

**TechnicalDebt**  
https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TechnicalDebt.html  
Software systems are prone to the build up of cruft - deficiencies in internal quality that make it harder than it would ideally be to modify and extend the system further. Technical Debt is a metaphor, coined by Ward Cunningham, that frames how to think about dealing with this cruft, thinking of it like a financial debt.

Countries around the world have agreed to work toward achieving universal, affordable internet access by 2020 as part of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. However, right now we’re on track to miss this goal by decades. With the rate of people coming online slowing down, we’re unlikely to achieve universal access until after 2050.

**独家专访院士张钹：AI奇迹短期难再现 深度学习技术潜力已近天花板**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/MrnIr2SgB0NdgsBImuTKXQ  
深度学习目前人工智能最受关注的领域，但并不是人工智能研究的全部。张钹认为尽管产业层面还有空间，但目前基于深度学习的人工智能在技术上已经触及天花板，此前由这一技术路线带来的“奇迹”在Alphago获胜后未再出现，而且估计未来也很难继续大量出现。技术改良很难彻底解决目前阶段人工智能的根本性缺陷，而这些缺陷决定了其应用的空间被局限在特定的领域——大部分都集中在图像识别、语音识别两方面。同时，在张钹看来，目前全世界的企业界和部分学界对于深度学习技术的判断过于乐观，人工智能迫切需要推动到新的阶段，而这注定将会是一个漫长的过程，有赖于与数学、脑科学等结合实现底层理论的突破。
