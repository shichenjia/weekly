**frontend design, react, and a bridge over the great divide**  
http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/frontend-design-react-and-a-bridge-over-the-great-divide/  
“Frontend development” is now so loaded that I quipped that as a frontend designer I live on the “front of the frontend”, while there are plenty of other developers living on the “back of the frontend”. I’d like to lean into that distinction because this great divide is played out in a very real way in JavaScript frameworks like React.

**Quark: A Software 'Sketchbook' for Node, HTML and CSS Experiments**  
https://quarkjs.io/  
Quark is a general purpose software tool specifically designed to help you create projects written in HTML, CSS and JavaScript with native desktop app like capabilities.

**Redux with Code-Splitting and Type Checking**  
https://blogs.dropbox.com/tech/2019/07/redux-with-code-splitting-and-type-checking/  
What happens when you only need a few reducers on each page, but it could be any permutation of the total number of reducers you support? How do you code-split your store so you’re not serving unnecessary JavaScript on a single page? And while you’re working on code splitting, how do you get it to play nicely with TypeScript so that you can trust what’s going in and coming out of the store?

**How I ruined my application performances by using React context instead of Redux**  
https://blog.theodo.com/2019/07/how-i-ruined-my-application-performances-by-using-react-context-instead-of-redux/  
I used React contexts instead of Redux for centralized states; Without a selector system, my components where getting lots of data as props, some of them were often changing and not necessary to build the view; Any changes in these contexts objects caused almost all my components to rerender; I had thousands of useless rerenders at every user interaction; Refactor all the application to use Redux and use wisely the selector system to give each components strictly what it needed solved the problem; Before choosing between contexts or redux, think about the optimizations the selector system can bring you.

**HTML静态页面原型交付工具“魔卡”简介**  
https://www.zhangxinxu.com/wordpress/2019/07/html-mockup/  
目前还有很多团队还是传统后端开发套页面方式，即使前端工程化开发成熟大厂也会有类似需求。矛盾就出现了：交接方希望得到的是干净的HTML原型，不是和前端工程化耦合在一起的HTML页面；而前端同学希望开发时候可以借助前端工程化，以快速便捷开发同时易于维护。那有没有什么办法同时兼顾呢，处理好这种矛盾呢？这样的痛点促使了“魔卡”的出现。免安装，直击静态页面开发痛点，提高开发效率降低维护成本。

**比Hadoop快至少10倍的物联网大数据平台，我把它开源了**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzIzNzg5MTcxNA==&mid=2247483940&idx=1&sn=94dd582d6d4f2f927b0e7e4f183be97c  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzIzNzg5MTcxNA==&mid=2247483946&idx=1&sn=903e985dc37b3799e8d254578b396234  
写了35年的程序，终于把自己的看家本领晒了出来，共享出来。两年多的时间，近二十万行代码，放在了GitHub上。好多朋友关切的问我，开源怎么赢利？抛开开源的商业模式不提，我想，只要我们开源的代码真正创造了价值，有人用，那我和团队就是最大的赢家。如果30年后，还有人在用TDengine,哪怕只是其中一个模块，其中一个函数，那就是对我们两年多日夜奋战的最大肯定，就是给我这个程序员的最大回报。更希望30年后，我还能对TDengine继续贡献代码，那将是我还未老去的最好证明。钱再多，也难让人在历史上留下痕迹，但一幅好的作品却可以传承，让后人好好的品味。愿我领头开发的TDengine成为传世之作，Leave a dent in the world!

**Everything You Need To Know About CSS Margins**  
https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2019/07/margins-in-css/  
Margins in CSS seem simple enough at first glance. Applied to an element it forms a space around the element, pushing other elements away. However, there is more to a margin than you might think.

**Node.js 12: The future of server-side JavaScript**  
https://blog.logrocket.com/node-js-12/  
Node.js has been a game-changing technology since its initial release back in 2009. In a nutshell, it lets developers use JavaScript to run scripts on the server side producing dynamic web content before the page is sent to the user’s web browser. Consequently, Node.js represents a “JavaScript everywhere” paradigm, unifying web application development around a single programming language, rather than needing different languages for server-side and client-side scripts. If you’re a fan of JavaScript and Node.js, like I am, you’ll be excited to know it’s about to get a whole lot better.

**Introducing Osgood: A New V8-Based Platform for Building HTTP Servers**  
https://dev.to/tlhunter/introducing-osgood-4k1m  
[Osgood](https://github.com/IntrinsicLabs/osgood) became our attempt to build such a platform. However, we didn't want such a tool to be completely unfamiliar to developers. So, we reached for a pile of technology already familiar to many. The platform is built using Rust, a language heralded for its safety, and JavaScript is run in V8, a ridiculously fast JavaScript engine.

**HTTP Security Headers - A Complete Guide**  
https://nullsweep.com/http-security-headers-a-complete-guide/  
In this article, I will walk through the commonly evaluated headers, recommend security values for each, and give a sample header setting. At the end of the article, I will include sample setups for common applications and web servers.

**Think in Math. Write in Code**  
https://justinmeiners.github.io/think-in-math/  
Programmers love to discuss programming languages. Besides debating their own merits, we integrate them into our identities and even infer things about others who use them. Some even defend a form of Linguistic Determinism that thinking is limited to what is typable. Since we spend so much time using languages, an interest in making them better is justified. However, the character of these debates suggests that we think of them as something more. Perhaps we have forgotten their primary role. Programming languages are implementation tools, not thinking tools. They are strict formal languages invented to instruct machines in a human-friendly way. In contrast, thoughts are best expressed through a medium which is free and flexible.

**Operating a Large, Distributed System in a Reliable Way: Practices I Learned**  
https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/operating-a-high-scale-distributed-system/  
For the past few years, I've been building and operating a large distributed system: the payments system at Uber. I've learned a lot about [distributed architecture concepts](https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/distributed-architecture-concepts-i-have-learned-while-building-payments-systems/) during this time and seen first-hand how high-load and high-availability systems are challenging not just to build, but to operate as well. Building the system itself is a fun job. Planning how the system will handle 10x/100x traffic increase, ensuring data is durable, regardless of hardware failures is intellectually rewarding. However, operating a large, distributed system has been an eye-opening experience for myself.

**Open Sourcing Brooklin: Near Real-Time Data Streaming at Scale**  
https://engineering.linkedin.com/blog/2019/brooklin-open-source  
[Brooklin](https://github.com/linkedin/Brooklin/) is a distributed system intended for streaming data across multiple different data stores and messaging systems with high reliability at scale. It exposes a set of abstractions that make it possible to extend its capabilities to support consuming and producing data to and from new systems by writing new Brooklin consumers and producers. At LinkedIn, we use Brooklin as the primary solution for streaming data across various stores (e.g., Espresso and Oracle) and messaging systems (e.g., Kafka, Azure Event Hubs, and AWS Kinesis).

**Presto at Pinterest**  
https://medium.com/@Pinterest_Engineering/presto-at-pinterest-a8bda7515e52  
To provide employees with the critical need of interactive querying, we’ve worked with Presto, an open-source distributed SQL query engine, over the years. Operating Presto at Pinterest’s scale has involved resolving quite a few challenges. In this post, we share our journey.

**Introducing the Plato Research Dialogue System: A Flexible Conversational AI Platform**  
https://eng.uber.com/plato-research-dialogue-system/  
Plato was designed to address these needs and can be used to create, train, and evaluate conversational AI agents for a variety of use cases. It supports interactions through speech, text, or structured information (in other words, dialogue acts), and each conversational agent can interact with human users, other conversational agents (in a multi-agent setting), or data. Perhaps most significantly, Plato can wrap around existing pre-trained models for every component of a conversational agent, and each component can be trained online (during the interaction) or offline (from data).

**Big Data Is Still Hard. Here’s Why**  
https://www.datanami.com/2019/07/15/big-data-is-still-hard-heres-why/  
We’re over a decade into the big data era that emerged from the tectonic collision of mobile, Web 2.0, and cloud forces. Bolstered by progress in machine learning, we stand at the cusp of a new AI era that promises even greater automation of rudimentary tasks. But despite the progress in AI, big data remains a major challenge for many enterprises. 另附：[Google got Looker. Salesforce bought Tableau.

**Let's Build a Compiler**  
https://generalproblem.net/  
Compilers, interpreters, runtimes, and the like can sometimes feel vaguely magical. They take your code, perform complex transformations that you only partially understand, and spit out an executable binary. Clearly, the inner workings of such a beast must contain arcane secrets, not meant for the minds of mortals. Of course, even if it feels that way sometimes, that doesn't make it true. As with everything else in software, there's no magic. You can understand it, with a little research and experimentation. There's plenty of resources out there to understand how compilers work. I haven't found anything that takes you from zero to a fully usable compiler, though, so I figured I'd try to write something that fits the bill. I've always found that the best way to learn how a system works is to build one yourself, so let's do that. In short, this series will walk you through building an optimizing compiler from scratch. Hopefully we'll both learn something along the way.

**History and effective use of Vim**  
https://begriffs.com/posts/2019-07-19-history-use-vim.html  
This article is based on historical research and on simply reading the Vim user manual cover to cover. Hopefully these notes will help you (re?)discover core functionality of the editor, so you can abandon pre-packaged vimrc files and use plugins more thoughtfully.

**Parrotron: New Research into Improving Verbal Communication for People with Speech Impairments**  
https://ai.googleblog.com/2019/07/parrotron-new-research-into-improving.html  
Project Euphonia has demonstrated that speech recognition models can be significantly improved to better transcribe a variety of atypical and dysarthric speech. Today, we are presenting Parrotron, an ongoing research project that continues and extends our effort to build speech technologies to help those with impaired or atypical speech to be understood by both people and devices. Parrotron consists of a single end-to-end deep neural network trained to convert speech from a speaker with atypical speech patterns directly into fluent synthesized speech, without an intermediate step of generating text—skipping speech recognition altogether.

**.NET Reunified: Microsoft’s Plans for .NET 5**  
https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/mt833477.aspx  
When Microsoft announced .NET 5 at Microsoft Build 2019 in May, it marked an important step forward for developers working across desktop, Web, mobile, cloud and device platforms. In fact, .NET 5 is that rare platform update that unifies divergent frameworks, reduces code complexity and significantly advances cross-platform reach. This is no small task. Microsoft is proposing to merge the source code streams of several key frameworks—.NET Framework, .NET Core and Xamarin/Mono. The effort will even unify threads that separated at inception at the turn of the century, and provide developers one target framework for their work.

Computers are disappearing. This doesn’t mean they’re actually going away, though. In fact, every day more and more of how we live, work, and interact is transformed by computers. But it does mean that technology has become so ubiquitous in recent years that our focus can now shift from our computers to what they enable us to do.

**稻盛和夫告别演讲：人生因思维方式而改变**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/HHOq6X4cRQBXWLjoQn6V_Q  
为度过美好的人生，纯粹的思维方式具有强大的力量，从而带来美好的命运。在20世纪初，英国伟大的心灵导师詹姆斯·艾伦说：不论是眼前的目标还是人生目的，心灵纯洁者更容易成功。为什么美好心灵的哲学能有这样的力量？因为这个世界上流淌着宇宙的意志，引导一切事物向着美好的方向前行。只要与宇宙潮流相一致，就能成长和发展。或者也可以做这样的比喻：人生在大海上航行，首先要依靠自己的力量拼命划船，同时还需要伙伴的帮助，但仅仅这些还是不够。只有靠“他利之风”，才能到彼岸。破洞的船帆，无论风力如何强劲，也无法获得动力。与此相反，纯粹美好的风帆，就能乘风破浪。理解哲学，就是扬帆起航。目的是为了接受在世界流淌的他利之风。就是磨砺自己的心灵，让它变得美丽和纯粹。
