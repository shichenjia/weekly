## 深阅读  

**Why Mason And Front-End As A Service Will Be A Game Changer For Product Development**  
https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2019/05/mason-front-end-service-product-development/  
Software development and maintenance has, generally speaking, been a time-consuming and arduous process for developers and engineers who carry the brunt of the work. However, with the introduction of front-end-as-a-service, and a company like Mason pioneering the way, that could all change. Here’s what you need to know about FEaaS.

**Open source collaborative text editors**  
https://juretriglav.si/open-source-collaborative-text-editors/  
For years now I've had this itch, trying to find the "perfect" collaborative text editor. But not just any collaborative text editor, oh no, my speciality is finding (well, at least looking for) open source real-time collaborative web-based rich text editors (i.e. not just plain text, but structured content as well). The focus of this post is thus on this quite niche category of open source tools and the tech that powers them, but if your interests are wider, you can check out this [constantly updated list of editors](https://github.com/JefMari/awesome-wysiwyg).

**Why are 2D vector graphics so much harder than 3D?**  
https://blog.mecheye.net/2019/05/why-is-2d-graphics-is-harder-than-3d-graphics/  
To those not well-versed in the details of the modern GPU, it’s a very surprising conclusion! But 2D graphics has plenty of unique constraints that make it a difficult problem to solve, and one that doesn’t lend itself well to parallel approaches. Let’s take a stroll down history lane and trace the path that led us here in the first place, shall we?

**SVG Will Save Us**  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxte3WpyO60  
SVGs are one of the most underutilized technologies on the web. They can be the most performant, flexible, and accessible image formats. In this session, Sarah will cover a few practical things like styling SVG icons like typography, and then dive into the creative wilds of this graphic format built with math. She'll make it respond to physics, make it bounce and snap, and make it interactive with front-end frameworks like Vue.js and React. In this session Sarah will push the boundaries of what's possible while also thinking about cross-browser stability, and you'll come out of it with a whole new world of tools in your front-end developer toolbox.

**API 设计最佳实践的思考**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/qWrSyzJ54YEw8sLCxAEKlA  
API 是模块或者子系统之间交互的接口定义。好的系统架构离不开好的 API 设计，而一个设计不够完善的 API 则注定会导致系统的后续发展和维护非常困难。接下来，阿里巴巴研究员谷朴将给出建议，什么样的 API 设计是好的设计？好的设计该如何做？

**HTTP API 认证授权术**  
https://coolshell.cn/articles/19395.html  
本篇文章会覆盖如下技术：HTTP Basic; Digest Access; App Secret Key + HMAC; JWT – JSON Web Tokens; OAuth 1.0 – 3 legged & 2 legged; OAuth 2.0 – Authentication Code & Client Credential.

**阿里巴巴“数据库侠客”**  
http://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzU0NDEwMTc1MA==&mid=2247492406&idx=1&sn=fd2684669ede0824e7d184349df4d48d  
数据库工程师半夜起床的日子再也没了，自动化运维程序的精致让过去的热血蜷缩在日志里。吹过原野的风目睹了那些草莽英雄撤离战场，顶级院校的计算机大神扛起大旗。人们在曾经野兽横行的荒原上，建起了安静细密的城市。历史曾有一万条岔路，阿里巴巴理应庆幸自己如今仍是互联网大潮中的一朵巨浪。而互联网浪潮，又是中国厚厚自传中的一章。

**How we optimized Magic Pocket for cold storage**  
https://blogs.dropbox.com/tech/2019/05/how-we-optimized-magic-pocket-for-cold-storage/  
In this post, we’ll discuss another advance in storage technology at Dropbox: a new cold storage tier that’s optimized for less frequently accessed data. This storage runs on the same SMR disks as our more active data, and through the same internal network.

**Predicting Stack Overflow Tags with Google’s Cloud AI**  
https://stackoverflow.blog/2019/05/06/predicting-stack-overflow-tags-with-googles-cloud-ai/  
We wanted to build a machine learning model that would resonate with developers, so Stack Overflow was a great fit. In order to train a high accuracy model we needed lots of Stack Overflow data. Luckily such a dataset exists in BigQuery. This dataset includes a 26 GB table of Stack Overflow questions updated regularly (you can explore the dataset in BigQuery here). In this post I’ll walk through building the model, understanding how the model is making predictions with SHAP, and deploying the model to Cloud AI Platform. 

**We Can Do Better Than SQL**  
https://edgedb.com/blog/we-can-do-better-than-sql/  
SQL started with a goal to empower non-programmers to work with the relational data effectively. Despite its shortcomings, it has arguably been wildly successful, with most databases implementing or emulating it. However, like any solution, SQL is facing increasing inadequacy in the support of the new requirements, modes of use and user productivity. It is time we do something about it.

**The reason I am using Altair for most of my visualization in Python**  
http://fernandoi.cl/blog/posts/altair/  
Altair is a wrapper for [Vega-Lite](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/), a JavaScript high-level visualization library. One of Vega-LiteIn the rest of the article, I will mainly refer to Altair, but Vega-Lite deserves as much (or more) credit. Most important features is that its API is based in the grammar of graphics. Grammar of graphics may sound like an abstract feature, but it is the main difference between Altair and other Python visualization libraries. Altair matches the way we reason about visualizing data.

**IT runs on Java 8**  
https://veekaybee.github.io/2019/05/10/java8/  
In today’s online economy where thousands of developers are online, the person whose voice is the loudest gets the most weight. The loudest people aren’t going to be those working with legacy systems. This piece of the puzzle is the one that worries me the most. What I’m worried about is that places like Hacker News, r/programming, the tech press, and conferences expose us to a number of tech-forward biases about our industry that are overenthusiastic about the promises of new technology without talking about tradeoffs.

**What We’ve Built Is a Computational Language (and That’s Very Important!)**  
https://blog.stephenwolfram.com/2019/05/what-weve-built-is-a-computational-language-and-thats-very-important/  
I’ve sometimes found it a bit of a struggle to explain what the Wolfram Language really is. Yes, it’s a computer language—a programming language. And it does—in a uniquely productive way, I might add—what standard programming languages do. But that’s only a very small part of the story. And what I’ve finally come to realize is that one should actually think of the Wolfram Language as an entirely different—and new—kind of thing: what one can call a computational language.

**How to Design Effective Infographics?**  
https://uxplanet.org/infographic-design-26dad026bbdd  
An infographic is a visual representation of a story. You have something to tell your audience, infographics provide you a way of presenting the information more effectively.

We are web professionals; we can do better than an offline workaround. The choices we make impact the online and offline experiences of real people who are trans, non-binary, or gender-variant—choices that can affirm or exclude, uplift or annoy, help or harm. The rest of this article assumes you agree with the concept that trans people are human beings who deserve dignity, respect, and care.

**Lessons on Visualization from the Industrial Environment**  
https://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2019/05/lessons-on-visualization-from-the-industrial-environment.php  
Making a user interface beautiful does not necessarily mean adding rich graphics or eye-popping colors. There is beauty in simplicity. Moreover, users do not view a data visualization for the sake of admiring its aesthetics, but to get answers to their top-of-mind questions. Viewing an effective visualization should be like receiving a report from a trusted confidant that clearly answers the users’ questions in a way that does not further burden them.
