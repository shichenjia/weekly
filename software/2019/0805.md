**React + Redux + Comlink = Off-main-thread**  
https://dassur.ma/things/react-redux-comlink/  
The more I read up on React, the more I see React and Redux appearing together. That got me thinking: My goal is to bring off-main-thread architectures to main-stream web development. Are React and Redux compatible with this philosophy? Let’s give it a try!

**Getting to the Heart of Digital Accessibility**  
https://alistapart.com/article/getting-to-the-heart-of-digital-accessibility/  
Quick! Think of the word “developer” or “coder” — what’s the first thing that comes to mind? Maybe a whiteish male in his twenties living in a busy metropolis, wearing a nerdy t-shirt and hoodie? Someone a bit like Mark Zuckerberg? Or maybe a younger Bill Gates or Sergey Brin? Any of the dudes from the HBO series Silicon Valley, perhaps? Certainly no one like me.

**Do React Hooks Replace Redux?**  
https://medium.com/javascript-scene/do-react-hooks-replace-redux-210bab340672

**技术人需要突破的 10 个困局**  
https://www.yuque.com/sxc/front/gsvr3x  
2010 年工作，2013 年初涉创业，至今 9 年，无论是创业还是在职场都趟了不少弯路，前两周对团队做技术管理者套路内训时，把过去的收获整理成这 10 句话，放到了 PPT 最后一页作为结语，感觉过于简练了，打算再做一个更准确的阐述。

**JavaScript: What’s new in ES2019**  
https://blog.tildeloop.com/posts/javascript-what%E2%80%99s-new-in-es2019  
As one of the most popular programming languages and the staple of web development, JavaScript is constantly evolving and with each iteration it gets some fresh internal changes. Let’s check out some of the new proposed features of ES2019 that could soon find a way into our everyday code.

**This Ain’t Disney: A practical guide to CSS transitions and animation**  
https://blog.prototypr.io/this-aint-disney-a-practical-guide-to-css-transitions-and-animations-a8b87e7c5531  
Digital user experiences, however, are not bound by strict laws governing the physics of movement; designers are essentially left to their own devices to come up with a physics pattern and apply it effectively to their design. This do-it-yourself culture around animation introduces a risk factor, and designers don’t really get a share of the project’s “risk budget,” which is usually reserved for new tech, so this often takes animation off the table for smaller teams. With that said, you’re not completely in the dark when using CSS. You have useful tools and defaults to get started, and with some basic knowledge, you can begin introducing a pleasant animated experience for your users.

**I Used The Web For A Day On A 50 MB Budget**  
https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2019/07/web-on-50mb-budget/  
Data can be prohibitively expensive, especially in developing countries. Chris Ashton puts himself in the shoes of someone on a tight data budget and offers practical tips for reducing our websites’ data footprint.

**Browser extensions are underrated: the promise of hackable software**  
https://www.geoffreylitt.com/2019/07/29/browser-extensions.html  
Among major software platforms today, browser extensions are the rare exception that allow and encourage users to modify the apps that we use, in creative ways not intended by their original developers. On smartphone and desktop platforms, this sort of behavior ranges from unusual to impossible, but in the browser it’s an everyday activity. Browser extensions remind us what it’s like to have deep control over how we use our computers. 另附：[Google and Mozilla are failing to support browser extension developers](https://armin.dev/blog/2019/08/supporting-browser-extension-developers/).

**SMR: What we learned in our first year**  
https://blogs.dropbox.com/tech/2019/07/smr-what-we-learned-in-our-first-year/  
A year ago, we became the first major tech company to adopt high-density SMR (Shingled Magnetic Recording) technology for our storage drives. At the time, we faced a challenge: while SMR offers major cost savings over conventional PMR (Perpendicular Magnetic Recording) drives, the technology is slower to write than conventional drives. We set out on a journey to reap the cost-saving benefit of SMR without giving up on performance. One year later, here’s the story of how we achieved just that.

**EGG: A toolkit for multi-agent language emergence simulations**  
https://code.fb.com/ai-research/egg-toolkit/  
EGG is a new toolkit that allows researchers and developers to quickly create game simulations in which two neural network agents devise their own discrete communication system in order to solve a task together. For example, in one of the implemented games, one agent sees a handwritten digit and has to invent a communication code to tell the other agent which number it represents.

**Evolution of Netflix Conductor: v2.0 and beyond**  
https://medium.com/netflix-techblog/evolution-of-netflix-conductor-16600be36bca  
Conductor is a workflow orchestration engine developed and open-sourced by Netflix. In the last two years since inception, Conductor has seen wide adoption and is instrumental in running numerous core workflows at Netflix. Many of the Netflix Content and Studio Engineering services rely on Conductor for efficient processing of their business flows. The Netflix Media Database (NMDB) is one such example. In this blog, we would like to present the latest updates to Conductor, address some of the frequently asked questions and thank the community for their contributions.

**Experiment, Simplify, Ship**  
https://blog.golang.org/experiment  
We experiment with Go as it exists now, to understand it better, learning what works well and what doesn’t. Then we experiment with possible changes, to understand them better, again learning what works well and what doesn’t. Based on what we learn from those experiments, we simplify. And then we experiment again. And then we simplify again. And so on. And so on.

**Hackathon Starter - A boilerplate for Node.js web applications**  
https://github.com/sahat/hackathon-starter  
If you have attended any hackathons in the past, then you know how much time it takes to get a project started: decide on what to build, pick a programming language, pick a web framework, pick a CSS framework. When I started this project, my primary focus was on simplicity and ease of use. I also tried to make it as generic and reusable as possible to cover most use cases of hackathon web apps, without being too specific. In the worst case, you can use this as a learning guide for your projects, if for example you are only interested in Sign in with Google authentication and nothing else.

**营销活动设计的数据驱动**  
https://www.yuque.com/gkx5p8/xiy9bn/qecgbv  
在营销活动设计过程中，影响活动的效果外在因素非常的多，例如市场上如果有同类型的营销活动，用户可能产生了疲劳度也是会影响自己公司的营销活动，但是你无法预测是不是存在这种风险；第二是设计效果引起的数据转化，在不同类型的营销活动中有可能会有比较大的不同，例如曾经在红包码的主活动页面露出多个分享渠道，发现总体点击率是下降的，而变成一个按钮并显示“分享赚钱红包”后，点击率是上升的，绝对用户点击数量也是比直接露出高一些，但是在其他活动的数据转化中却得到了相左的结论。因此设计假设、设计测试输出的结论是相对结论，可以作为经验和思考的方向，在应用之后，还应该通过科学的验证方法进行测试，并不断迭代优化。本文主要提供了一些在设计层面数据驱动的思维框架与思考方法，可能还有很多不足，但是我们会不断进行完善，让这个方式更简单易用，切实的能帮助更多的设计师有理有据的做设计。

**Expanding the Concept of Design**  
https://blog.prototypr.io/expanding-the-concept-of-design-4a0aaa510476  
Since the late 1960s, the concept of design has undergone a rapid expansion, both in academic discourse and in industry. While the specific meaning of the word design within more narrowly defined particular contexts has not been lost, the design concept on the whole has become more and more encompassing. Expanding far beyond beautification and form giving, or the technical conception and creation of artefacts, processes and organizations, design is increasingly being recognized as a fundamental influence in most human activities. Professor David Orr pertinently illustrates the challenges associated with the expanding awareness of the significance of design.

**Why do some developers at strong companies like Google consider Agile development to be nonsense?**  
https://www.quora.com/Why-do-some-developers-at-strong-companies-like-Google-consider-Agile-development-to-be-nonsense/answer/David-Jeske?share=1  
However, once you get past these high level ideas into details, the agreement starts to fade. Agile has some good ideas but it also has problematic elements which are too centered around short-term thinking for working on revolutionary engineering projects done at companies like Google. Without getting buried in details, let’s look at the themes in Principles behind the Agile Manifesto.

**吴军：顶级工程师能让中国走向浪潮之巅**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzIyMjYyMzg3MA==&mid=2247490431&idx=1&sn=d4268bd70cf2b98a3a7e889ff0dafb6f  
最近很多人都在讨论吴军，源于他在接受采访时曾对几家炙手可热的互联网公司进行了直接且大胆的点评：「腾讯从来没有过 To B 的基因」、「百度是一个基本属于僵化的公司，已经没有希望了」、「谷歌是一个颇为平庸的公司」。此外，他对企业「基因论」的认可也受到了颇多争议。时值《浪潮之巅》第 4 版出版之际，GitChat 采访了吴军，在关于「基因论」、「知识付费」、「工程师文化」等问题上，他表达了自己的观点。本文无意争论功过是非，只希望读者可以通过吴军博士真实的见解有所收获。另附：[刘润对谈吴军：给腾讯和所有上进企业的4点建议](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MjM5NjM5MjQ4MQ==&mid=2651617526&idx=1&sn=794b559e6635dcb3ac3e15824642a9a3)、[独家对话吴军：和前东家两不相欠，一些人用奴性理解时代](http://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzUxOTc4OTU3Mw==&mid=2247483787&idx=1&sn=b1632a274f274369c181b76f00c4ae6f)、[若没有高质量的讨论，很难科学运用“企业基因论”](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzA3MDMwOTcwMg==&mid=2650007152&idx=1&sn=c44f0afec051e092d07d33f962467d56)。

很多人有这样的体会：我知道抱怨不好，可是，改不了。我知道学习可以提升自己，但是，学不下去。我知道积极心态可以使人快乐，然而，就是开心不起来。许多问题不是无解，而是知而未行。如何做到知行合一？本文为你提供一些方法，帮助你从“我知道”走向“我行动”。王阳明提出“心即理”，意思是一切事物的“理”都存在于自己的心灵深处，“圣人之道，吾性自足。”每个人的本性当中，原本就具有圣人之道，而我们却总在向外寻找张驰，忘了本有家珍。让我们先将时间穿梭到六百多年前的明朝，看看王阳明的故事，或许会得到些许启示。
