**Top-level await**  
https://v8.dev/features/top-level-await  
[Top-level await](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-top-level-await) enables developers to use the await keyword outside of async functions. It acts like a big async function causing other modules who import them to wait before they start evaluating their body. 另附：[The V8 Engine and JavaScript Optimization Tips](https://alligator.io/js/v8-engine/).

**The State of Machine Learning Frameworks in 2019**  
https://thegradient.pub/state-of-ml-frameworks-2019-pytorch-dominates-research-tensorflow-dominates-industry/  
In 2019, the war for ML frameworks has two remaining main contenders: PyTorch and TensorFlow. My analysis suggests that researchers are abandoning TensorFlow and flocking to PyTorch in droves. Meanwhile in industry, Tensorflow is currently the platform of choice, but that may not be true for long.

**Tools I recommend for building Geospatial Web Applications**  
https://medium.com/swlh/tools-i-recommend-for-building-geospatial-web-applications-274d6939536c  
Being a freelance WebGIS developer, it is very frequent for me to decide what tools I’ll need for my next project. Now after a few years of experience, this decision has become a bit easier because of prior knowledge and I thought I should share it with all those who want to build a Geospatial Webapp.

**Vue 3.0 公开代码之后……**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/_9XaMyAv0NjJRvwKEEleuw  
源码公开后不久，社区内就有源码解析的文章出现，甚至还有培训课程打出了《从0实现 Vue 3.0 响应式源码》的噱头。尽管有一些“学不动了”的自嘲，社区里对 Vue 3.0 源码开放事件，总体上是一个非常正面的态度。在这种背景下，我注意到了两段争论，一个来自国外社区，一个来自国内；它们围绕不同的主题，却恰好拥有相同的内核。颇有意思，我认为值得分享给大家。

**AntV 发布 G6 3.1 —— 潜心**  
https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/85702103  
自 G6 诞生以来，由 G6 承接的业务可以分为两大类，一类是图分析，另一类是图编辑。两者虽然有一定的程度上的相似，但各自的侧重点不同，前者更注重图数据的分析体验。后者更注重交互的编辑体验。之前我们使用 G6 来同时支持这两种不同类型的业务，从实际效果来看，并不能达到我们的期望。从 G6 3.1 版本开始，我们更侧重于图分析领域。

**Umi UI 二期来了**  
https://github.com/sorrycc/blog/issues/87  
Umi UI 一期做好了一个架子，但只是包含一些基础功能，而要做提效，则需要一些实打实的功能。一个月后的 Umi UI 二期带来了一些进阶功能，比如资产（区块+模板）、Mini 气泡、编译态同步、build 和 dev 文件分析等。

**小程序底层实现原理及一些思考**  
https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/81775922  
两月以后，看着电脑，我回想起接到通知说要开发小程序引擎的那个下午。当时的我以为，这个小程序和其他小程序都不一样，因为它是个假的，其实是个网页。两月之后，我才发现，“噢~原来大家都是这么做的啊”。最近一直在做小程序的底层实现，过程中磕磕绊绊也多次进行架构方向上的转型，趁着周末抽空写一篇文章记录一下开发过程中遇到的问题和一些思考与决策。本篇文章更多的是在描述架构与技术方向层面的思考和决策，不会过多介绍具体某个问题是如何解决的，因为细节实在太多。

**[译]一位开发者的幽默独白：JavaScript工具怎么就这么烂**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzUxMzcxMzE5Ng==&mid=2247492706&idx=1&sn=06f434b05e00b4b6950e10032d785be7  
JavaScript 工具难用吗？作为 JavaScript 开发者的你是否早已对其叫苦不迭。本文将主要描述 JavaScript 工具的各种相关缺点，并解释这些缺点产生的原因。接下来就让我们一起跟随作者，看一看 JavaScript 工具“烂”在哪些方面。

**The Full-stack Software Design & Architecture Map**  
https://khalilstemmler.com/articles/software-design-architecture/full-stack-software-design/  
Software Design and Architecture is pretty much it's own field of study within the realm of computing, like DevOps or UX Design. Here's a map describing the breadth of software design and architecture, from clean code to microkernels.

**99% of the Git commands you'll need at work, demonstrated in a single script**  
https://bitbucket.org/BitPusher16/dotfiles/raw/49a01d929dcaebcca68bbb1859b4ac1aea93b073/refs/git/git_examples.sh  
this script creates repos in a sandbox directory and uses them for demos. add an exit command anywhere to stop the script and examine repo state. rerun the script freely. it cleans up the sandbox before each run. the sandbox dir is ignored so created files are not added to any uber repo.

**The Evolution of Web Content Management**  
https://remotesynthesis.com/blog/evolution-of-web-content-manaagement  
The next step is simplifying the process of developing JAMStack sites that are tied to content sources (a headless CMS, an API, or any of a number of data sources). Some part of this already started with tools like [NetlifyCMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/) - which has a one click deploy of a CMS-backed JAMStack site - and has continued with services like [Stackbit](https://www.stackbit.com/) - which allows you to deploy a site by choosing a static site generator and a headless CMS and deploy it in minutes with just a few clicks.

**Making Instagram.com faster: Part 3 — cache first**  
https://instagram-engineering.com/making-instagram-com-faster-part-3-cache-first-6f3f130b9669  
In recent years instagram.com has seen a lot of changes — we’ve launched stories, filters, creation tools, notifications, and direct messaging as well as a myriad of other features and enhancements. However, as the product grew, a side effect was that our web performance began to slow. Over the last year we made a conscious effort to improve this. This ongoing effort has thus far resulted in almost 50% cumulative improvement to our feed page load time. This series of blog posts will outline some of the work we’ve done that led to these improvements. In part 1 we talked about prefetching data and in part 2 we talked about improving performance by pushing data directly to the client rather than waiting for the client to request the data.

**Adding Static Code Analysis to Stack Overflow**  
https://stackoverflow.blog/2019/10/08/adding-static-code-analysis-to-stack-overflow/  
we’re applying static analysis to some of the code behind public Stack Overflow, Stack Overflow for Teams, and Stack Overflow Enterprise in order to pre-emptively find and eliminate certain kinds of vulnerabilities. How we accomplished this is an interesting story and also illustrative of advancements in .NET’s open source community.

**Scribe: Transporting petabytes per hour via a distributed, buffered queueing system**  
https://engineering.fb.com/data-infrastructure/scribe/  
Our hardware infrastructure comprises millions of machines, all of which generate logs that we need to process, store, and serve. The total size of these logs is several petabytes every hour. The outputs are generally processed somewhere other than where they were generated: They can be relevant to a variety of downstream processing pipelines and may each need to be accessed at different times. The task of collecting, aggregating, and delivering this volume of logs (with low latency and high throughput) requires a systematic approach. Our solution is Scribe, a distributed queueing system that encapsulates all the complexity behind moving service logs from point A to point B.

**How LinkedIn customizes Apache Kafka for 7 trillion messages per day**  
https://engineering.linkedin.com/blog/2019/apache-kafka-trillion-messages  
We maintain over 100 Kafka clusters with more than 4,000 brokers, which serve more than 100,000 topics and 7 million partitions. The total number of messages handled by LinkedIn’s Kafka deployments recently surpassed 7 trillion per day.

**Why Salesforce Moved from Python to Go**  
https://stackoverflow.blog/2019/10/07/how-salesforce-converted-einstein-analytics-to-go/  
Here at Salesforce, we had just this situation arise in the past few years. We ported most of our Einstein Analytics backend from a Python-C hybrid to Go. Go is a language that Google designed for large-scale, modern software engineering. The story goes that Google engineers had the idea to create a language designed for their large-scale applications and started designing Go while they were waiting for their massive C++ projects to compile. This post will discuss our experience in moving enterprise-level software from a C-Python hybrid over to an (almost) completely Go application. 另附：[Uber Go Style Guide](https://github.com/uber-go/guide/blob/master/style.md).

**Understanding Scheduling Behavior with SchedViz**  
https://opensource.googleblog.com/2019/10/understanding-scheduling-behavior-with.html  
Linux kernel scheduling behavior can be a key factor in application responsiveness and system utilization. Today, we’re announcing [SchedViz](https://github.com/google/schedviz), a new tool for visualizing Linux kernel scheduling behavior. We’ve used it inside Google to discover many opportunities for better scheduling choices and to root-cause many latency issues.

**PyPy's new JSON parser**  
https://morepypy.blogspot.com/2019/10/pypys-new-json-parser.html  
In the last year or two I have worked on and off on making PyPy's JSON faster, particularly when parsing large JSON files. In this post I am going to document those techniques and measure their performance impact. 

**Improving the Getting Started experience with AWS Lambda**  
https://aws.amazon.com/cn/blogs/compute/improving-the-getting-started-experience-with-aws-lambda/  
To help you start right with serverless, AWS has added a Create application experience to the Lambda console. This enables you to create serverless applications from ready-to-use sample applications, which follow these best practices:  
- Use infrastructure as code (IaC) for defining application resources  
- Provide a continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for deployment  
- Exemplify best practices in serverless application structure and methods

**Stop Calling it Bad Code**  
https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/bad-code/  
By not using generic and negative terms like “bad”, conversations about code become constructive. Instead of starting with an emotional statement - this code is bad! - you’re now starting with observations and suggestions. Using this approach, people who you give feedback to will not feel threatened and act reflexively defensive, pushing back on your comments. That is what would happen if you started with vague and judging terms, like “bad code”.

**Design Challenge — Rethinking Medium UI/UX design**  
https://medium.com/sketch-app-sources/design-challenge-rethinking-medium-ui-ux-design-e2fa8e7d4d1  
I have been a user on Medium for years. I enjoy reading tons of inspiring articles and sharing my thoughts about design, art, and life with people. I have two identities on Medium, reader, and writer. As a product designer, I have seen the positive features of Medium.

**The Future of UX Is Our Humanity**  
https://www.toptal.com/designers/ui/the-future-of-ux  
The UX field has changed as new and emerging technologies dominate product development. However, the true value a UX professional brings to the design process doesn’t come from tech knowledge, but from human-centered skills, and in order for UX to continue to evolve, development of these “soft” skills is crucial.

**Facebook Design: Images and Sketch Files of Popular Devices**  
https://facebook.design/devices  
Facebook supports a diverse audience around the world and an equally diverse set of devices. To emphasize that in our design mocks, we redrew a range of devices to show the global diversity of the people using our products. Each device comes with a bitmap of the device (with and without shadows) and the original Sketch file for that device. We’ve incorporated many of these devices into Origami and worked with the Framer Team to add them to Framer as well.

**Writing is Thinking: Learning to Write with Confidence**  
https://blog.stephsmith.io/learning-to-write-with-confidence/  
If you told me 5 years ago that I would one day lead a 20-person Publications team or have a personal blog that’s read by hundreds of thousands, I would’ve laughed in surprise. Yet somehow, I’ve found myself in that reality. Here we are. People often ask how I approach writing, so I decided to share this piece to sway the self-conscious writer inside each one of us. I hope it encourages others to develop a practice that enables them to write with confidence, by simply sharing how I’ve designed my own.
