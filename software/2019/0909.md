**Continuous Delivery for Machine Learning**  
https://martinfowler.com/articles/cd4ml.html  
Automating the end-to-end lifecycle of Machine Learning applications. Machine Learning applications are becoming popular in our industry, however the process for developing, deploying, and continuously improving them is more complex compared to more traditional software, such as a web service or a mobile application. They are subject to change in three axis: the code itself, the model, and the data. Their behaviour is often complex and hard to predict, and they are harder to test, harder to explain, and harder to improve. Continuous Delivery for Machine Learning (CD4ML) is the discipline of bringing Continuous Delivery principles and practices to Machine Learning applications.

**Google Engineering Practices Documentation**  
https://google.github.io/eng-practices/  
Google has many generalized engineering practices that cover all languages and all projects. These documents represent our collective experience of various best practices that we have developed over time. It is possible that open source projects or other organizations would benefit from this knowledge, so we work to make it available publicly when possible.

**AppSec POV on Dependency Management**  
https://blog.npmjs.org/post/187496869845/appsec-pov-on-dependency-management  
It’s tempting to assume that all packages in the npm registry are safe to use––and, for the vast majority of them, that’s true. The npm security team and the JavaScript community at large exercises a high degree of vigilance over the hygiene of the massive shared code library that has made JavaScript the most popular and powerful software platform.

**Hello! Umi UI**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/5Ezo9_1JZACmywJcPBbGDA  
Umi UI 这个大坑，今年总算还是踩了。其实去年还是前年就想做了，但这件事听起来太前沿，和业务关系不大，而且有很大的不确定性，所以优先级始终不高。而今年要在提效上发力，需要有一些可能会带来巨大变化的事情，于是被提上日程。然后经过一个多月的开发，Umi UI 的第一个版本终于上了。

**WXInlinePlayer - We Can Playsinline And AutoPlay In WeChat WebView!**  
https://player.qiaoz.net/index.html  
随着直播和短视频的兴起，视频由于承担了更大的信息量，因此现在已经是非常主流的运营/产品信息输出方式。但由于国内各个浏览器厂商自身的利益关系所在，他们对HTML5的Video能力做了非常多的限制，其具体问题可以参考腾讯IMWeb团队编写的[《复杂帧动画之移动端Video采坑实现》](https://juejin.im/post/5d513623e51d453b72147600)。为了解决这些问题，我们通过软解FLV的方式实现了WXInlinePlayer，同时我们也编写了WebAssembly版本的FLV Demuxer。

**MVVM 框架的数据状态管理的发展与探索**  
https://github.com/farzer/blog/issues/1  
在前端应用日渐复杂的环境下，前段页面状态管理可控制和可跟踪成为解决开发和调试的重要手段，显然我们有必要了解状态管理方案可以解决什么问题，解决问题的核心方式是什么。

**MongoDB，再见还是再等等**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MjM5MDE0Mjc4MA==&mid=2651019223&idx=1&sn=14ac1930bc4820bcad8174ca6cfa3af7  
MongoDB 是时下最受欢迎的数据库之一，许多企业和开发者都将其作为自己的解决方案。但在近日，macOS 平台的开源包管理系统 Homebrew 宣布 Homebrew-core 公式将移除 MongoDB 支持。在过去的一年时间内，包括红帽、英国卫报等在内的多家知名企业也都选择了移除 MongoDB。原因何在？

**TypeScript vs ReasonML – A Comparison**  
https://blog.dubenko.dev/typescript-vs-reason/  
Both TypeScript and ReasonML claim to offer statically typed language for web developers that compiles to JavaScript. But there are important differences. TypeScript’s best and the worst feature is that is a superset of the JavaScript. And while having that familiarity with JavaScript is nice, it means that every quirkiness that we love and hate about JavaScript is still there in TypeScript. The types are added on top of the JavaScript and that works, kind of.

**Finished! Porting a 75,000 line native iOS app to Flutter**  
https://medium.com/flutter-community/finished-porting-a-75-000-line-native-ios-app-to-flutter-b5c0bff93715  
No matter how seductive SwiftUI or Jetpack Compose appear to be, a good cross-platform mobile solution is what most companies want. At least, that’s my experience. And, after building a drop-in replacement for a largish native iOS app, my experience is that Flutter is it. 另附：[SwiftUI: A new player in UI frameworks](https://blog.scottlogic.com/2019/09/02/swift-ui-a-new-player-in-ui-frameworks.html).

**What Is Infrastructure as Code? How It Works, Best Practices, Tutorials**  
https://stackify.com/what-is-infrastructure-as-code-how-it-works-best-practices-tutorials/  
Trends like cloud computing revolutionized—and improved—the way organizations design, develop, and maintain their IT infrastructure. One of the critical components of this trend is called “infrastructure as code,” and it’s what we’re going to talk about today.

**Our journey to type checking 4 million lines of Python**  
http://blogs.dropbox.com/tech/2019/09/our-journey-to-type-checking-4-million-lines-of-python/  
Dropbox is a big user of Python. It’s our most widely used language both for backend services and the desktop client app (we are also heavy users of Go, TypeScript, and Rust). At our scale—millions of lines of Python—the dynamic typing in Python made code needlessly hard to understand and started to seriously impact productivity. To mitigate this, we have been gradually migrating our code to static type checking using mypy, likely the most popular standalone type checker for Python. (Mypy is an open source project, and the core team is employed by Dropbox.)

**Giving Lens New Reading Capabilities in Google Go**  
http://ai.googleblog.com/2019/09/giving-lens-new-reading-capabilities-in.html  
In order for Lens to be able to help the greatest number of people, we needed to create a special version that can work on even the most basic smartphones. To make these reading features work, the Google Go version of Lens needs to be able to capture high quality images on a wide variety of devices, then identify the text, understand its structure, translate and overlay it in context, and finally, read it out loud.

**The state of machine learning in financial services**  
https://blog.algorithmia.com/the-state-of-machine-learning-in-financial-services/  
The financial services industry has often been at the forefront of using new technology to solve business problems. It’s no surprise that many firms in this sector are embracing machine learning, especially now that increased compute power, network connectivity, and cloud infrastructure are cheaper and more accessible. This post will detail five important machine learning use cases that are currently providing value within financial services organizations.

**Apple Just Shipped Web Components to Production and You Probably Missed It**  
https://dev.to/ionic/apple-just-shipped-web-components-to-production-and-you-probably-missed-it-57pf  
Apple announced [the release of the new beta Apple Music Web Client](https://www.engadget.com/2019/09/05/apple-music-web-player-beta-browsers/), giving Apple Music customers the ability to listen to their favorite music from the web instead of only through an installed native app. I was following the conversation on Hacker News, and many were excited to see Apple embracing the web and bringing parity to other music apps like Spotify that have had rich web experiences since the early days. That Apple still cares deeply about the web was encouraging and exciting for many to see. 另附：[Firefox 69 — a tale of Resize Observer, microtasks, CSS, and DevTools](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2019/09/firefox-69-a-tale-of-resize-observer-microtasks-css-and-devtools/).

**What Is a Tech Company?**  
https://stratechery.com/2019/what-is-a-tech-company/  
At first glance, WeWork and Peloton, which both released their S-1s in recent weeks, don’t have much in common: one company rents empty buildings and converts them into office space, and the other sells home fitness equipment and streaming classes. Both, though, have prompted the same question: is this a tech company? Of course, it is fair to ask, “What isn’t a tech company?” Surely that is the endpoint of software eating the world; I think, though, to classify a company as a tech company because it utilizes software is just as unhelpful today as it would have been decades ago.

**走访了十几家美国企业服务公司，我们写下了这篇万字文章**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/NMAHVvELuHFViu92mF0stg  
在旧金山还有一个比消费互联网更炽热的行业：企业服务。GGV纪源资本企业服务投资团队在符绩勋带领下拜访了旧金山的十几家企业服务创业公司，力求能加深对企业服务行业的理解，并写作此文，希望让中国创业者得到启发。我们预判，中国SaaS企业发展可能的趋势：  
1. 在中国，个人用户和企业用户对云，对订阅式付费和增值服务付费意愿都在不断加强。但这将是一个线性变化的过程，需要时间和耐心。 
2. 中国中型企业将是SaaS付费的主力军，它们对SaaS的易用性有很高要求（中国的大型企业更希望采取定制化的服务，而不是订阅式的服务；小型企业付费意愿仍然会很低）。3. 中国的大型To C企业会对To B市场产生深远影响（例如钉钉，企业微信），会在这些体系下诞生一些美国没有的产品。

**RPA 18 年进化史**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/PFp0r1AaSa-AN58rkDV3WA  
2012 年之前，RPA 概念还不存在。6 年之后，RPA赛道上就诞生了 70 亿美元估值的公司。这个赛道的增长之快令人瞠目。头部玩家 Blue Prism 已上市，另一家头部公司 Uipath 从 10 亿美元到 70 亿美元的成长速度则刷新了 toB 企业的增速。2017年之前，国内还少有人听说“RPA”这一名词。仅仅一年半之后，RPA就成了资本市场的小风口，迅速升温。对标70亿美元估值的UiPath，几乎所有 RPA 厂商都在讲 RPA + AI 的故事——背后是一个RPA 迈向能够更大范围替代（或辅助）人类员工的愿景。在与UiBot合并后，来也科技无疑是最接近这个资本故事的。
从AI技术起家，新增国内最大的RPA社区支持，手握3500万美元融资，来也科技要怎么做好“中国版UiPath ”？
