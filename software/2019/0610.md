**Rethinking Visual Programming with Go**  
https://divan.dev/posts/visual_programming_go/  
This is a blog version of the talk I gave at GopherCon Europe 2019 (Canary Islands Edition), where I shared my thoughts on why Visual Programming Languages have failed and revealed for the first time my experiment on visualizing Go code. I could dive in straight into the project, but I do believe to truly appreciate it, I have to explain the thought line behind it first. It starts with an almost existential frustration of working with code as a text.

**The economics of package management**  
https://github.com/ceejbot/economics-of-package-management/blob/master/essay.md  
An essay version of C J Silverio’s [talk from JSConfEUwatch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MO8hZlgK5zc). She was ousted as CTO of npm, Inc. last year but is back with a history of the JavaScript package ecosystem, a discussion of who really ‘owns’ it, and a suggestion for a new way forward oriented around [Entropic](https://github.com/entropic-dev/entropic), a new, agnostic, federated package registry.

**Best practices for building a large scale react application**  
https://buttercms.com/blog/best-practices-for-building-a-large-scale-react-application  
This article describes the steps to building a large scale React application. While making a Single Page App with React, it is very easy for your code-base to become unorganized. This makes the app hard to debug and even harder to update or to extend the codebase. There are many good libraries in the React ecosystem that can be used to manage certain aspects of the app, this article covers some of them in depth. Other than that, it lists some good practices to follow from the beginning of the project if you have scalability in mind. With that being said let’s head to the first step - how to plan ahead of time.

**前端困境与挑战：组织篇**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MjM5Mjg4NDMwMA==&mid=2652976688&idx=1&sn=c9f4c3146cd9417410668937a6d94497  
在上一篇文章《前端困境：个人篇》中，我们讨论了关于个人在前端领域遇到的一些问题和挑战。在这一篇文章中，我们将关注于组织中的前端技术挑战。

**[译]2020年你应该知道的8种前端JavaScript趋势和工具**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzUxMzcxMzE5Ng==&mid=2247491446&idx=1&sn=f839f2017b88b3628d8d8a6a5852bf59  
前端开发人员和技术人员的数量逐年增加，而整个生态系统渴望实现标准化。新技术和工具的出现已经改变了游戏规则。可以肯定地说，总体趋势将是 UI 标准化、基于组件的模块化和组合，这将影响从样式到测试甚至状态管理的所有方面，并在总体上实现更好的模块化。

**Self-Host Your Static Assets**  
https://csswizardry.com/2019/05/self-host-your-static-assets/  
One of the quickest wins—and one of the first things I recommend my clients do—to make websites faster can at first seem counter-intuitive: you should self-host all of your static assets, forgoing others’ CDNs/infrastructure. In this short and hopefully very straightforward post, I want to outline the disadvantages of hosting your static assets ‘off-site’, and the overwhelming benefits of hosting them on your own origin.

**The Future of Web Animation**  
https://frontendfoc.us/link/64814/web  
In terms of animation on the web, we’re just getting started.  

**Types and Tests**  
http://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2019/06/08/TestsAndTypes.html  
The problem Mark proposed in his blog is a simple function: rndselect(n,list). It returns a list of n elements randomly selected from the input list. He walked through his strategy for developing this in Haskell, using types, QuickCheck, and after-the-fact tests.

**Making our Android Studio Apps Reactive with UI Components & Redux**  
https://medium.com/netflix-techblog/making-our-android-studio-apps-reactive-with-ui-components-redux-5e37aac3b244  
Our current player UI in the Netflix Android app is using our first iteration of this componentization architecture. We took the opportunity with building Prodicle to improve upon what we learned with the Player UI, and build the app from scratch using Redux, Components, and 100% Kotlin.

**Introducing TensorNetwork, an Open Source Library for Efficient Tensor Calculations**  
https://opensource.googleblog.com/2019/06/introducing-tensornetwork-open-source.html  
TensorNetwork uses TensorFlow as a backend and is optimized for GPU processing, which can enable speedups of up to 100x when compared to work on a CPU. We introduce TensorNetwork in a series of papers, the first of which presents the new library and its API, and provides an overview of tensor networks for a non-physics audience. In our second paper we focus on a particular use case in physics, demonstrating the speedup that one gets using GPUs.

**Efficient, reliable cluster management at scale with Tupperware**  
https://code.fb.com/data-center-engineering/tupperware/  
Since we first deployed Tupperware in 2011, our infrastructure has expanded from one data center to a fleet of 15 geo-distributed data center locations. Over the same time period, Tupperware has evolved significantly to keep pace with our growth. We are sharing several areas in which Tupperware advances the state of the art for cluster management, including seamless support for stateful services, a single control plane across data centers, and the ability to shift capacity among services in real time. We will also share some of the lessons we have learned as we have grown the system to its current state.

**13 Tips for Writing a Technical Book**  
https://performancejs.com/post/31b361c/13-Tips-for-Writing-a-Technical-Book  
I spent the last year and a half writing my first technical book for O’Reilly (Programming TypeScript). I’d never written a technical book before. In fact, prior to the 300-page book, the longest thing I’d written was a 20-something-page paper in college. The rest of this post is a brief laundry list of tips for writing your own technical book.

https://www.cockroachlabs.com/blog/oss-relicensing-cockroachdb/  
Citing the ‘realities of building open source software’, the creators of CockroachDB have relicensed it from Apache to the ‘Business Source License’ which prevents anyone (e.g. Amazon/AWS) from offering CockroachDB as a service without buying a license (a problem that has befallen both Elasticsearch and MongoDB this year).

大学系统的智慧之处之一，是让你们能够来到这里。这里既包含了优秀的学者，他们用其一生探索着宇宙中我们已经知晓、或许知晓、以及必须知晓的事物，他们每天在人类积累的知识前沿耕耘，被学术自由的原则所保护，被学者气质的氛围所引导，并在大学去中心化的管理架构中工作。在历史上，相较于资本或政策，伟大的研究型大学更能驱动人类的进步，为人类生活打下根基。无论是在个人还是社交生活中，思想都是最重要的——或者说思想才是全部，而大学本身即关乎思想。对“寻求真理”和“有意义的行为”的推与拉，是当今高等教育和未来生活所特有的。“服务社会和世界”的同时保持“独特的精神面貌”，这个双重目标是我们一直感受到的，它的向心力会随着时间的推移而增加。
