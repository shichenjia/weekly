https://medium.com/the-vue-point/vue-2-6-released-66aa6c8e785e  
This release combines a number of substantial improvements, internal changes and new features which are highlighted in this post.

**New features in Webpack 5**  
https://blog.logrocket.com/new-features-in-webpack-5-2559755adf5e  
In this article, I’ll be sharing some new features coming to Webpack 5, and what you should be aware of as you continue to use it in your daily work. This new release is jam-packed with tons of new goodies and while I won’t detail every new feature, I will share the few that are important as outlined by the core team.

**React-Redux Roadmap: v6, Context, Subscriptions, and Hooks**  
https://github.com/reduxjs/react-redux/issues/1177  
In this issue, I want to lay out a description of the changes we made in v6 and why we made them, the challenges we are currently facing, the constraints that potential solutions need to conform to, and some possible courses of action for resolving those challenges.

**How To Architect A Complex Web Table**  
https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2019/02/complex-web-tables/  
Tables frequently appear on the web but aren’t easy to design and code. This illustrated guide explains the table anatomy and how to build a table, keeping in mind its future elaboration. 

**Revisiting the abbr element**  
https://bitsofco.de/revisiting-the-abbr-element/  
A few weeks ago, I wrote about how to make the abbr element work for touchscreen, keyboard, and mouse. My suggestion involved making the `<abbr>` element focusable with the tabindex attribute and using pseudo-elements to create a tooltip from the title attribute. Since then, I’ve gotten some feedback on some accessibility-related issues to the implementation. With this feedback, I decided to revisit this and create a more accessible solution.

**Paint the Picture, Not the Frame: How Browsers Provide Everything Users Need**  
https://alistapart.com/article/paint-the-picture-not-the-frame  
Every website and web app is its own self-contained experience, with its own ideas of how things should look and behave. Some are closer to others, but each one requires learning how to operate the interface to a certain degree. Some browsers can also have parts of their functionality and appearance altered, meaning that as with websites, there can be unexpected discrepancies. We’ll unpack some of the nuance behind some of these features, and more importantly, why most of them are better off left alone.

**Native or PWA? How to Choose the Right Approach for Mobile App Development**  
https://blog.ionicframework.com/native-or-pwa-how-to-choose-the-right-approach-for-mobile-app-development/  
Getting ready to kick off your next mobile application project and not sure whether to build a native mobile app or a Progressive Web App? This guide is for you! 另附：[

**Computer science in JavaScript: Doubly linked lists**  
https://humanwhocodes.com/blog/2019/02/computer-science-in-javascript-doubly-linked-lists/  
Implementing a doubly linked list in JavaScript.

**TensorFlow.js: machine learning for the web and beyond**  
https://blog.acolyer.org/2019/02/04/tensorflow-js-machine-learning-for-the-web-and-beyond/  
TensorFlow.js brings TensorFlow and Keras to the the JavaScript ecosystem, supporting both Node.js and browser-based applications. As well as programmer accessibility and ease of integration, running on-device means that in many cases user data never has to leave the device.

**How we wrote our own Service Worker**  
https://engineering.tumblr.com/post/182554757749/javascript-how-we-wrote-our-own-service  
As we continue the process of reinvigorating Tumblr’s frontend web development, we’re always on the lookout for modern web technologies, especially ones that make our mobile site feel faster and more native. You could have guessed that we are making the mobile dashboard into a progressive app when we open-sourced our webpack plugin to make web app manifests back in August. And you would’ve been right. But to make a high quality progressive web app, you need more than just a web app manifest—you also need a service worker.

**Continuously testing React applications with Jest and Enzyme**  
https://circleci.com/blog/continuously-testing-react-applications-with-jest-and-enzyme/  
To get the most out of this article, we assume a basic familiarity with React and Redux. If you’re new to React, the Intro to React tutorial provides a good overview of how React works. The Learn Redux section in the Redux docs provides lots of learning resources and the Redux examples page is also a good resource for exploring sample apps and getting a feel for how Redux works. With this info out of the way, let’s go ahead and get started.

**Writing and Maintaining Good Code Documentation**  
https://pspdfkit.com/blog/2019/writing-and-maintaining-good-code-documentation/  
Writing documentation is a practice that everyone working with code should strive to comply with. Since we ship an SDK here at PSPDFKit, providing good and clear documentation to our customers is as important to us as building the SDK itself. In this post, I want to outline how we handle documentation for our iOS products and show how you can leverage the same techniques we’re using to make your life easier.

**Refactoring MDN macros with async, await, and Object.freeze()**  
https://hacks.mozilla.org/2019/02/refactoring-mdn-macros-with-async-await-and-object-freeze/  
In January, we landed a major refactoring of the KumaScript codebase and that is going to be the topic of this post because the work included some techniques of interest to JavaScript programmers.

**The state of gRPC in the browser**  
https://grpc.io/blog/state-of-grpc-web  
gRPC 1.0 was released in August 2016 and has since grown to become one of the premier technical solutions for application communications. So far the benefits have largely only been available to mobile app and backend developers, whilst frontend developers have had to continue to rely on JSON REST interfaces as their primary means of information exchange. However, with the release of gRPC-Web, gRPC is poised to become a valuable addition in the toolbox of frontend developers. In this post, I’ll describe some of the history of gRPC in the browser, explore the state of the world today, and share some thoughts on the future.

**Logging Levels 101**  
https://stackify.com/logging-levels-101/  
How do logging levels fit into this picture? How are they useful to the reader performing a post-mortem debug on an application? What are logging levels anyway? How many of them are there?

**Performance monitoring with OpenTracing, OpenCensus, and OpenMetrics**  
https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/instrument-opencensus-opentracing-and-openmetrics/  
If you are familiar with instrumenting applications, you may have heard of OpenMetrics, OpenTracing, and OpenCensus. These projects aim to create standards for application performance monitoring and collecting metric data. Although the projects do overlap in terms of their goals, they each take a different approach to observability and instrumentation. In this post, we’ll provide an introduction to all three projects, along with some key differentiators of each, and how they best support application monitoring.

**Incrementally migrating over one million lines of code from Python 2 to Python 3**  
https://blogs.dropbox.com/tech/2019/02/incrementally-migrating-over-one-million-lines-of-code-from-python-2-to-python-3/  
Over the last few months, we’ve explored why and how we rolled out our Python 3 migration, and how we ensured that the resulting application was reliable. In this piece, we’ll take a brief walk through the history of Python 3 in our desktop client, and then dive into the details of how we pulled off a gradual migration while allowing ongoing development.

**Understanding Database Sharding**  
https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/understanding-database-sharding  
In this conceptual article, we will discuss one such database architecture: sharded databases. Sharding has been receiving lots of attention in recent years, but many don't have a clear understanding of what it is or the scenarios in which it might make sense to shard a database. We will go over what sharding is, some of its main benefits and drawbacks, and also a few common sharding methods.

**Event Sourcing is Hard**  
https://chriskiehl.com/article/event-sourcing-is-hard  
Why would I say such things? Because I'm a guy who previously drank the juice, had the power to make design calls, and took a team down the path of building an event sourced system from scratch. After an aggressive year of deploying a complex application, I've collected a lot of scars, bruises, and lessons learned. Below are my opinions, unexpected hurdles, bad assumptions, bad understandings, after growing an Event Sourced application.

**IntersectionObserver in WebKit**  
https://webkit.org/blog/8582/intersectionobserver-in-webkit/  
Web authors often need to know when a particular element on a page becomes visible. The element could be an ad or a video whose viewability we want to compute. Or we might want to defer loading an image until it is visible. A common way to solve this problem is using polling, periodically computing the position of an element with respect to the viewport. However, polling is inefficient, wastes battery life, and doesn’t work for cross-origin content. The IntersectionObserver API offers a better solution to this problem, and is now available in Safari Technology Preview, macOS 10.14.4 beta, and iOS 12.2 beta.

**Open sourcing ClusterFuzz**  
https://opensource.googleblog.com/2019/02/open-sourcing-clusterfuzz.html  
[Fuzzing] is an automated method for detecting bugs in software that works by feeding unexpected inputs to a target program. It is effective at finding memory corruption bugs, which often have serious security implications. Manually finding these issues is both difficult and time consuming, and bugs often slip through despite rigorous code review practices. For software projects written in an unsafe language such as C or C++, fuzzing is a crucial part of ensuring their security and stability. Today, we’re announcing that [ClusterFuzz](https://github.com/google/clusterfuzz) is now open source and available for anyone to use.

**被忽略的设计原则（SAP vs Salesforce vs 蚂蚁金服）**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzAwNjU3ODkxMw==&mid=2651658362&idx=1&sn=57d3c3e0a150759491c34368aa19da70  
不知道有多少人在阅读一套设计规范的时候会去看设计原则的部分，并且花时间深入思考它背后的含义？至少以前的我，接触一个新的规范时候都是直接从视觉交互的部分开始，觉得这种假大空的文字是纯粹的装饰品，就像装帧上必不可少的高大上扉页而已。作为设计规范的真实消费者，没什么必要去研究设计原则。后来，工作职能的转变使我看待设计规范的角度发生了变化：我一直忽略的设计原则，其实是设计规范硬核的内在，它是设计过程中指导的思路与方法。而页面、控件等组件的交互行为是设计的基本的元素。我关注的最多的设计规范是SAP的Fiori，Salesforce的Lightning，蚂蚁金服的Ant Design。Fiori发布于2013年，后两者发布于2015年。我用了很长的时间观察和学习这些设计规范的变迁，这三者有各自的风格和特性并且都在不断的进化，组件日益成熟。

**Reflecting on My Failure to Build a Billion-Dollar Company**  
https://medium.com/@shl/reflecting-on-my-failure-to-build-a-billion-dollar-company-b0c31d7db0e7  
In 2011 I left my job as the second employee at Pinterest–before I vested any of my stock–to work on what I thought would be my life’s work: Gumroad. It would become a billion-dollar company, with hundreds of employees. It would IPO, and I would work on it until I died. Something like that. That didn’t happen. Now, it may look like I am in an enviable position, running a profitable, growing, and low-maintenance software business with customers who adore us. But for years, I considered myself a failure. At my lowest point, I had to lay off 75% of my company, including many of my best friends. I had failed. I no longer feel shame in the path I took to get to where I am today. It took me years to realize that I was misguided from the outset. This is that journey, from the beginning.

**腾讯发布2019互联网趋势报告，205页PPT解读16大机会**  https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MjM5NDI2NDU5Mw==&mid=2655260666&idx=1&sn=cdf7fd852dbad127e2e5822bae9d7b5f  
2019年1月，腾讯·企鹅智库正式发布长达205页的《2019-2020中国互联网趋势报告》。这是一份聚焦于未来两年，市场和用户变迁的最新数据和研究。当经济增长面临更多的复杂性，行业红利和人口红利已经告别野蛮生长时，我们也许比中国互联网历程中的任何时刻，都更需要了解我们的用户，更需要重新认识他们。因为我们从未真正认识那个完整意义上的“他们”。

对于科幻电影的元年，观众期盼已久。自2015年《三体1》获得雨果奖之后，中国便开始了“科幻元年”叙事，年年都有，却年年落空。等待四年，《流浪地球》终于踏出了中国科幻的第一步。

**知者不言，言者不知：论华人工程师之领导力**

相对于华人领导者更强调内心修为，印度裔领导者更关注传递价值观，培养沟通能力、影响力、以及对商业的理解，而这些更加贴近西方对于领导力的定义。因此，华人工程师如果要培养领导力，应该培养更强的软实力，要实现从技术领导者到商业领导者的转换，并更深刻地理解所从事事业的社会意义。本文试图探讨以下问题：领导力的本质是什么？华裔和印度裔在文化上的差别如何导致不同的领导力风格？处于变革期的企业需要什么样的领导者？华人该如何培养领导力？
