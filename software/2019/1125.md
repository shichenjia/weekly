**The Firefox UI is now built with Web Components**  
https://briangrinstead.com/blog/firefox-webcomponents/  
The Firefox UI can be thought of as a very large single page app. It was built with DOM and JS from the start, which was a bold technology choice for a native application 20+ years ago. Because of this, Mozilla implemented some features necessary to build complex web applications way before the Web platform supported them. Over time, these features have evolved into specifications like CSS flexbox and Web Components. When this happens, it’s easy to allow the existing codebase to continue to use the original version, and require the platform supports both features. This makes sense - rewriting legacy code that already works is difficult and not always cost effective. But we made a decision while Web Components were being implemented in Firefox to start a parallel project in which we would migrate our existing UI components to use them.

**JavaScript 2019 - The Web Almanac by HTTP Archive**  
https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2019/javascript  
The HTTP Archive crawls millions of pages every month and runs them through a private instance of WebPageTest to store key information of every page. (You can learn more about this in our methodology). In the context of JavaScript, HTTP Archive provides extensive information on the usage of the language for the entire web. This chapter consolidates and analyzes many of these trends. 另附：[CSS - 2019](https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2019/css).

**蚂蚁前端研发最佳实践**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/BlbXnt-TRGxQwklV87IkzA  
以下是云谦在 2019.11.15 成都全栈大会分享的文字稿，介绍了蚂蚁前端研发的最佳实践，其中提取了三个比较重要的点，每个点都是蚂蚁实践和深入思考后的结果，希望能对大家有所启发。

**双11模块79.34%的前端代码是怎样智能生成的？**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzUxMzcxMzE5Ng==&mid=2247493193&idx=1&sn=068cb894b3b6064e1173ee911eb03190  
最近几年，AI 渗透到开发领域的方方面面。在前端领域，设计稿生成代码（简称 D2C）就是一个例子。其目标在于通过 AI 助力前端提效升级，杜绝简单重复性的工作内容。今年“双十一”，阿里的 D2C 覆盖了天猫淘宝会场的新增模块，包含了视图代码和部分逻辑代码的自动生成。在可统计范围内，D2C 代码生成占据了相当大的比例。那么，这 79.34% 的前端代码是如何智能生成的？在实践过程中存在哪些技术痛点，开发人员又形成了怎样的思考？你的企业是否也可以落地 D2C？本文将通过阿里的实践案例为你解答。 

**2019 TWeb 腾讯前端技术大会精彩回顾**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/RKgnFiCdOhtiBbEjawAAAA  
TWeb 腾讯前端技术大会的总结，为了更清晰地阐述一些技术点，我会加上自己的理解介绍大会中的重点内容和相关技术落地的成果或进度.

**来聊聊面向模板的前端开发**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MjM5MTA1MjAxMQ==&mid=2651234675&idx=2&sn=83c4d76abfd06284b770432829624da8  
面向模板的开发方式很好，能够大幅度提高业务前端开发效率，一定程度上减少了业务系统的搭建速度；作为核心的模板和节点树是保持中立的，大大降低了运行时技术栈的迁移成本，且能够应对多端等场景。为了效率，一家公司里的业务前端开发到最后一定是面向模板，而非面向组件。

**Jupyter在美团民宿的应用实践**  
https://tech.meituan.com/2019/11/21/application-practice-jupyter.html

**Is Flutter ready for Enterprise mobile apps?**  
https://medium.com/digio-australia/is-flutter-ready-for-enterprise-mobile-apps-e3e9a0f11bea  
My aim here is to find at least one Flutter solution for each requirement, hopefully to show that Flutter is now ready to build Enterprise apps with little to no hybrid coding required. You may have unique requirements beyond these so of course your results may vary!

**Local-first software: you own your data, in spite of the cloud**  
https://blog.acolyer.org/2019/11/20/local-first-software/  
The authors coin the phrase “local-first software” to describe software that retains the ownership properties of old-fashioned applications, with the sharing and collaboration properties of cloud applications. Great local-first software should have seven key properties.

**I created the exact same app in React and Svelte. Here are the differences.**  
https://medium.com/javascript-in-plain-english/i-created-the-exact-same-app-in-react-and-svelte-here-are-the-differences-c0bd2cc9b3f8  
React vs Svelte. Finally, a side-by-side code comparison! Because you’ve heard the fuss about Svelte, and now you want to know what the hype is all about.

**Ultimate list of all tools we used to create a hit HTML5 game on Steam**  
https://www.codecks.io/blog/2019/creating-a-hit-steam-game-in-html5/  
In 2012 we started working on Curious Expedition. Back then HTML5 was a different landscape, but the idea of being on the forefront of this tech was exciting to me. I started building a custom engine using HTML5’s 2D Canvas support with the understanding that we would switch over to a proper engine once we hit a boundary for our vision of the game. Turns out that we never did and we ultimately ended up shipping a true HTML5 premium game on Steam, GOG and the HumbleStore. It has sold over 200,000 units to this date and features a strong 89% rating on Steam. This page features the ultimate list of every single tool and platform that we used during the development of Curious Expedition together with a verdict of if I would use it again or not.

**Uber Visualization Highlights: How Urban Symphony Adds an Audio Dimension to Visualization**

Uber’s Data Visualization team builds software that enables us to better understand how cities move through dynamic visualizations. The Uber Engineering Blog periodically highlights visualizations that showcase how these technologies can turn aggregated data into actionable insights.

**Modern Data Practice and the SQL Tradition**  
https://tselai.com/modern-data-practice-and-the-sql-tradition.html  
A specter is haunting Data Science—the specter of SQL. All the powers of new Data Management have entered into a holy alliance to exorcise this specter; Data Scientists and engineers, managers and developers, hipsters and disruptors. Especially among the young breeds of data practitioners, there is a growing consensus that SQL is not “cool”, not good enough or even worse “SQL is not professional enough and real data scientists should code”. My own experience, however, has taught me otherwise. Whether it is at the first stages of the pipeline like data collection and cleaning or the latter ones like feature engineering and report generation, I have come to appreciate the power and versatility of SQL and the effectiveness of RDBMS. In this essay, I collected some of my thoughts on the topic of SQL and how it fits into modern data practice. 另附：[Modern SQL - A lot has changed since SQL-92](https://modern-sql.com/).

**Microsoft REST API Guidelines**  
https://github.com/Microsoft/api-guidelines/blob/master/Guidelines.md  
The Microsoft REST API Guidelines, as a design principle, encourages application developers to have resources accessible to them via a RESTful HTTP interface. To provide the smoothest possible experience for developers on platforms following the Microsoft REST API Guidelines, REST APIs SHOULD follow consistent design guidelines to make using them easy and intuitive. This document establishes the guidelines Microsoft REST APIs SHOULD follow so RESTful interfaces are developed consistently.

**Successfully Merging the Work of 1000+ Developers**  
https://engineering.shopify.com/blogs/engineering/successfully-merging-work-1000-developers  
Collaboration with a large team is challenging, and even more so if it’s on a single codebase, like the Shopify monolith. Shopify changes 40 times a day. We follow a trunk-based development workflow and merge around 400 commits to master daily. There are three rules that govern how we deploy safely, but they were hard to maintain at our growing scale.

**A Philosophy of Software Design: My Take (and a Book Review)**  
https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/a-philosophy-of-software-design-review/  
I was somewhat skeptical when starting to read a Philosophy of Software Design, despite having it recommended by a friend. The book does a delightful job underselling itself. This post summarizes key takeaways of the book and my take on these principles, drawing from my professional and industry experience. 

**The Rise of Serverless Computing**  
https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2019/12/241054-the-rise-of-serverless-computing/fulltext  
Cloud computing in general, and Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) in particular, have become widely accepted and adopted paradigms for computing with the offerings of virtual machines (VM) on demand. By 2020, 67% of enterprise IT infrastructure and software spending will be for cloud-based offerings.1

**ExploratoryTesting**  
https://martinfowler.com/bliki/ExploratoryTesting.html  
Exploratory testing is a style of testing that emphasizes a rapid cycle of learning, test design, and test execution. Rather than trying to verify that the software conforms to a pre-written test script, exploratory testing explores the characteristics of the software, raising discoveries that will then be classified as reasonable behavior or failures.

Step by step guides and paths to learn different tools or technologies.

**The Architect of Modern Algorithms**  
https://www.quantamagazine.org/barbara-liskov-is-the-architect-of-modern-algorithms-20191120/  
Barbara Liskov pioneered the modern approach to writing code. She warns that the challenges facing computer science today can’t be overcome with good design alone.

**I heard the Full-stack position is a lie**  
https://cheesecakelabs.com/blog/heard-full-stack-position-lie/  
This post isn’t about a brand new discussion. I’ve seen this topic later on Twitter, blog posts, tech conferences – like FloripaJS – in my city, as well as other social networks. So I felt I could bring some of my thoughts about it, because I’ve worked as a Full-stack developer for a long time, and am I living a lie?

**5 Things I’ve Learned in 20 Years of Programming**  
https://daedtech.com/5-things-ive-learned-in-20-years-of-programming/  
I’m now pushing 20 years in the industry.  I spent about 10 of those in roles where my primary function was to write code.  The other 10 have involved managing programmers, coaching them, consulting with organizations about how to manage them, running a codebase assessment practice and these days, well, actually content marketing. This made me wonder to myself, “if I could summarize this experience into succinct bits of advice, and assuming that anyone actually cared, what would I tell these folks?” And that’s the premise for this post.  The following are the things I consider to be the most important lessons and takeaways from a 20 year programming career.

**What Newspapers Can Teach Us About Web Design**  
https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2019/11/newspapers-teach-web-design/  
Before the home page, there was the front page. From the Gutenberg Principle to grid systems to above the fold, newspapers teach us much about the foundations of web design.

**解读Fiori 3.0**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/oUVNkNGqGmruB-Ui8zm3OQ  
今年9月，随着SAP S/4 HANA 1909版本的更新，Fiori3.0引入到正式的产品线中。面向开发的SDK在UI5 1.65版本中也支持了Fiori 3.0的theme。在很多的行业大会上面，Fiori 3.0的内容都有面向开发者和Partner展示，Github也已经有开源的内容，很多第三方实施公司有针对Fiori 3.0写过一些文章，但都不是设计师的视角。所以本文将会基于已经公开的内容，以B端设计师的视角，剖析Fiori 3.0设计方向和理念。

**The Quest for Simplicity**  
https://blog.marvelapp.com/the-quest-for-simplicity/  
Designing a great UI is not rocket science. It has to be as simple as possible for the people to perform a task at hand and understand/get the information they need — fast. But we keep making them more complicated. We make them feel like a “software” rather than a “human interface”.

**Celebrating the Web Foundation’s 10th Birthday**  
https://webfoundation.org/2019/11/celebrating-the-web-foundations-10th-birthday/  
Ten years ago, Sir Tim Berners-Lee and Rosemary Leith established the World Wide Web Foundation to advance their vision of the open web as a public good and a basic right. We’ve come a long way in the past decade. 50% of the world is now online and billions are able to access information and use technology to solve problems in their communities. 另附：[We need a better web to help secure children’s basic rights](https://webfoundation.org/2019/11/we-need-a-better-web-to-help-secure-childrens-basic-rights/)

当下，我觉得大部分人还是低估了智能商业的冲击力。我把它定义为一个范式革命，互联网阶段仅是智能商业浪潮的一个前奏而已；一个互联网公司只有真正进入智能时代才算成功。如今市场对想做平台或生态型的企业提出了更高要求，比如创业者是不是自己Truly Believe，能不能把这个Believe传递给投资人 、合作伙伴、员工等。所以寒冬时期孕育出好企业不只是说说而已，面对当前环境，创业者要有向死而生的决绝与信仰，要有勇气成为少数派。
