**Code caching for JavaScript developers**  
https://v8.dev/blog/code-caching-for-devs  
In this blog post, we offer a few pieces of advice for JS developers who want to make the best use of code caching to improve the startup of their websites. This advice focuses on the implementation of caching in Chrome/V8, but most of it is likely transferable to other browsers’ code caching implementations too.

**jQuery 3.4.0 Released**  
https://blog.jquery.com/2019/04/10/jquery-3-4-0-released/  
So many of us owe so much to jQuery that I just have to feature any of its key updates (even if you might not need it). 3.4 is focused on bug fixes and performance improvements, but we’re told a serious overhaul is on the way for jQuery 4.0. 另附：[jQuery Terminal Emulator - web based terminal](https://github.com/jcubic/jquery.terminal).

**Design patterns in modern JavaScript development**  
https://levelup.gitconnected.com/design-patterns-in-modern-javascript-development-ec84d8be06ca  
Thoughts on effective communication in the design of software projects.

**Ryan Dahl. Deno, a new way to JavaScript. JS Fest 2019 Spring**  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6JRlx5NC9E  
From async-await to ArrayBuffers, the JavaScript language has changes significantly in the decade since Node.js was designed. Deno takes advantage of these developments and incorporate lessons learned in the development of Node to provide a new JavaScript platform built on V8 and Rust. This talk will teach the audience how to get started with Deno.

**Reasons Why JavaScript is Omnipresent in Modern Development**  
https://snipcart.com/blog/why-javascript-benefits  
Therefor , I want to use this post to answer these questions: What is JavaScript? Why is it so important? Why we use JavaScript? (or JS benefits)? What’s coming for JS? Even for experienced developers, it’s nice to stop for a second and remember where the tools you’re using are coming from and why you’re using them.

**在阿里云做前端**  
https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/61127760  
前端是个资源型角色，在认知里对业务的理解深度不够，加上通常负责业务领域很广，比较难有积累和沉淀。如果你问一个毕业10年的JAVA老司机，他跟你谈的一定是大流量下的分布式架构，而前端可能还是昨天茶余饭后讨论vue和react，或者是angular谁更强。如何突破，如何提供业务更多价值，前端们一直在苦苦探寻。网上很多文章，给人启发，但每个人面对的环境，负责的业务不同，不一定都适用。结合自己过去几年在阿里云的前端经验，也做个总结。

**前端核心代码保护技术面面观**  
https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/61651310  
本文首先适当回顾目前流行的前端核心代码保护的相关技术思路及简要的实现，后具体讲述一种更为安全可靠的前端核心代码保护的思路（SecurityWorker）供大家借鉴以及改进。当然，作者并非专业的前端安全从业者，对部分技术安全性的理解可能稍显片面及不足，欢迎留言一起探讨。

**阿里毕玄：我在系统设计上犯过的 14 个错**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzIxMzEzMjM5NQ==&mid=2651031744&idx=1&sn=3cf979f5c111d1553d47aa122a66a825  
在上篇《架构师画像》的文章中提到了自己在系统设计上犯过的一些错，觉得还挺有意义的，这篇文章就来回顾下自己近八年来所做的一些系统设计，看看犯的一些比较大的血淋淋的错误（很多都是推倒重来），这八年来主要做了三个基础技术产品，三个横跨三年的大的技术项目（其中有两个还在进行中），发现大的错误基本集中在前面几年，从这个点看起来能比较自豪的说在最近的几年在系统设计的掌控上确实比以前成熟了很多。

**写了十几年代码，我为什么还没有被拿去“祭天”？**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/9TnZy6LKTNCQJb-8n9y-6w  
十几年来，我一直坚持在编码岗位，经历了普通开发人员、TL、MDE、MDEL、SDM（云化团队）、Committer、软件专家等各种岗位。然而我却深知，不算大牛的我，从事编码这个“高危”职业十几年而没有被拿去“祭天”，依靠的是一个程序员的自我修养——扎实的基础软件能力、如履薄冰的工作态度、对技术孜孜不倦的追求。

**Native image lazy-loading for the web!**  
https://addyosmani.com/blog/lazy-loading/  
In this post, we'll look at the new loading attribute which brings native `<img>` and `<iframe>` lazy-loading to the web!.

**Digging Into The Display Property: The Two Values Of Display**  
https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2019/04/display-two-value/  
We talk a lot about Flexbox and CSS Grid Layout, but these layout methods are essentially values of the CSS display property, a workhorse of a property that doesn’t get a lot of attention. Rachel Andrew takes a better look in a short series.

**Javascript vs. CSS – More control means more responsibility**  
https://christianheilmann.com/2019/04/11/javascript-vs-css-more-control-means-more-responsibility-video-interview/  
A few weeks ago I was in Paris, France to visit Prismic and they interviewed me about the JavaScript vs. CSS debate. In 10 minutes we covered a lot :).

**JSON as configuration files: please don’t**  
https://arp242.net/weblog/json_as_configuration_files-_please_dont  
I’ve recently witnessed the rather disturbing trend of using JSON for configuration files. Please don’t. Ever. Not even once. It’s a really bad idea. It’s just not what JSON was designed to do, and consequently not what it’s good at. JSON is intended to be a “lightweight data-interchange format”, and claims that it is “easy for humans to read and write” and “easy for machines to parse and generate”.

**When To Use TypeScript - A Detailed Guide Through Common Scenariosr**  
https://khalilstemmler.com/articles/when-to-use-typescript-guide/  
Strap yourself in. In this guide, we compare when it's absolutely vital to be using TypeScript, the strictly-typed programming language, and when it makes sense to stick to vanilla JavaScript. 另附：[Learn more programming languages, even if you won't use them](https://thorstenball.com/blog/2019/04/09/learn-more-programming-languages/).

**Don’t trust the locals: investigating the prevalence of persistent client-side cross-site scripting in the wild**  
https://blog.acolyer.org/2019/04/10/dont-trust-the-locals-investigating-the-prevalence-of-persistent-client-side-cross-site-scripting-in-the-wild/  
In an analysis of the top 5000 Alexa domains, 21% of sites that make use of data originating from storage were found to contain vulnerabilities, of which at least 70% were directly exploitable using the models described in this paper. 另附：[How bad can it git?

**Aroma: Using machine learning for code recommendation**  
https://code.fb.com/developer-tools/aroma/  
Thousands of engineers write the code to create our apps, which serve billions of people worldwide. This is no trivial task—our services have grown so diverse and complex that the codebase contains millions of lines of code that intersect with a wide variety of different systems, from messaging to image rendering. To simplify and speed the process of writing code that will make an impact on so many systems, engineers often want a way to find how someone else has handled a similar task. We created Aroma, a code-to-code search and recommendation tool that uses machine learning (ML) to make the process of gaining insights from big codebases much easier.

**How eBay Governs its Big Data Fabric**  
https://www.ebayinc.com/stories/blogs/tech/how-ebay-governs-its-big-data-fabric/  
At eBay, nearly everything we do is based on data. We deal with structured, unstructured, and semi-structured data, where Hadoop, as a big data platform, has provided key technology features. Keeping pace with the speed of innovation while continuing to help data consumers easily find and consume the data they need guides our architecture and investment in building out eBay’s Big Data Fabric.

**Org-Mode Is One of the Most Reasonable Markup Languages to Use for Text**  
https://karl-voit.at/2017/09/23/orgmode-as-markup-only/  
This is about Org-mode syntax and its advantages even when used outside of Emacs. You can type Org-mode in vim, notepad.exe, Atom, Notepad++, and all other text editors out there. And in my opinion it does have advantages compared to the other, common lightweight markup standards such as Markdown, AsciiDoc, Wikitext or reStructuredText.

Let’s be honest, getting designs from your UX team into the hands of your engineering team in a way that makes sense is rarely easy. Add tight deadlines, team changes, and miscommunication to this process and your application will likely end up looking very different than what you expected. The handoff between design and development is no easy task.

**Slack Is Not Where 'Deep Work' Happens**  
https://blog.nuclino.com/slack-is-not-where-deep-work-happens  
How did you start your day today? Probably reached for the phone. Turned off the alarm. Glanced at the time. Scrolled through the Slack notifications. Went through the emails. You will likely continue doing it throughout the day, approximately 2,617 more times, according to some studies. We all do it, and despite all the virtues of digital minimalism, completely giving up those habits is extreme and, arguably, unnecessary. Yet we live in a culture obsessed with productivity and these harmless distractions are wreaking havoc on it.

在1998年亚马逊致股东信里，贝佐斯说：“我们要反抗熵（We want to fight entropy）。”管理学大师彼得·德鲁克说：“管理要做的只有一件事情，就是如何对抗熵增。在这个过程中，企业的生命力才会增加，而不是默默走向死亡。”物理学家薛定谔说：“自然万物都趋向从有序到无序，即熵值增加。而生命需要通过不断抵消其生活中产生的正熵，使自己维持在一个稳定而低的熵水平上。生命以负熵为生。”这么多人都在谈论熵，说要反抗熵，然而到底什么是熵？

**腾讯市值反超阿里，现实主义PK长期主义**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/X92pWViZL7KTt1MF1zlVLw  
今天变得很大的创业者无不是坚持了“用户/客户第一”：有的是现实主义，如字节跳动；有的是长期主义，如快手。去年，智联招聘CEO郭盛曾介绍，在中国中小企业存活年龄只有2.5年，而这一数字在日本是12.5年，在美国8年；大型企业平均寿命中国是7年，日本是58年、美国是40年，这与商业发达程度有关系，但与“机会主义”的盛行也有关系。要想基业长青，企业可以现实主义也可以长期主义，但机会主义，显然是没什么机会的。另附：[腾讯“偷塔”](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzU0NDEwMTc1MA==&mid=2247492205&idx=1&sn=78e0634b1c536db669a702f8f9ed9745)。
