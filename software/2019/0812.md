You might already be familiar with the Intl.NumberFormat API, as it’s been supported across modern environments for a while now. In its most basic form, Intl.NumberFormat lets you create a reusable formatter instance that supports locale-aware number formatting. 

**Apollo Client, now with React Hooks**  
https://blog.apollographql.com/apollo-client-now-with-react-hooks-676d116eeae2  
A new, slimmer API designed for modern React. Apollo Client now includes three hooks that you can drop into your app, anywhere you currently use a corresponding higher-order component or render prop component: useQuery, useMutation, and useSubscription. These hooks are simple to get started with, and they have many advantages over the previous APIs, including bundle size reductions and less boilerplate code.

**Serverless For Frontend 前世今生**  
https://www.yuque.com/egg/nodejs/sff-history  
作为一个前端，你可能一直在迷茫，Node.js 的定位是什么？为什么我们需要它？尤其是到了 2019 这个时间点，未来一段时间内，有一个词 -- Serverless 你会听到想吐。所有人都在说 Serverless，几乎没有人知道如何落地 Serverless  但大家都觉得其他人在大力做 Serverless，所以大家都在宣传自己在做 Serverless。阿里作为 Node.js 国内的引航者，在该领域深度实践多年。在国内第一个引入 BFF 的概念，现在也是第一个提出 SFF（Serverless For Frontend）。笔者过去几年有幸参与到该演化进程中，在此分享给大家一些心得，抛砖引玉。

**[译]摆脱JS框架，5年web组件开发经验总结**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzUxMzcxMzE5Ng==&mid=2247492121&idx=1&sn=866af57bc412fa277e28721e0d486168

**抖音研发实践：基于二进制文件重排的解决方案 APP启动速度提升超15%**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/Drmmx5JtjG3UtTFksL6Q8Q  
启动是App给用户的第一印象，对用户体验至关重要。抖音的业务迭代迅速，如果放任不管，启动速度会一点点劣化。为此抖音iOS客户端团队做了大量优化工作，除了传统的修改业务代码方式，我们还做了些开拓性的探索，发现修改代码在二进制文件的布局可以提高启动性能，方案落地后在抖音上启动速度提高了约15%。本文从原理出发，介绍了我们是如何通过静态扫描和运行时trace找到启动时候调用的函数，然后修改编译参数完成二进制文件的重新排布。

https://web.dev/native-lazy-loading  
Browser-level native lazy-loading is finally here!  As of Chrome 76 (available now), you can use the loading attribute to natively lazy load resources, without the need for custom code or a separate JS library. This post dives into the details.

**Writing Modes And CSS Layout**  
https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2019/08/writing-modes-layout/  
An understanding of CSS Writing Modes is useful if you want to work with vertical scripts, or change writing mode for creative reasons. However, they also underpin our new layout methods, and those ideas are increasingly being applied across all of CSS. In this article, find out why Rachel Andrew believes understanding writing modes is so important.

**Design Principles for Developers: Processes and CSS Tips for Better Web Design**  
https://css-tricks.com/design-principles-for-developers-processes-and-css-tips-for-better-web-design/  
Whenever you use HTML and CSS, you are designing—giving form and structure to content so it can be understood by someone else. People have been designing for centuries and have developed principles along the way that are applicable to digital interfaces today. These principles manifest in three key areas: how words are displayed (typography), how content is arranged (spacing), and how personalty is added (color). Let’s discover how to use each of these web design ingredients through the mindset of a developer with CSS properties and guidelines to take the guesswork out of web design.

**Welcome to Serverless 2.0**  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvXm-oHi5Mg

You’ll learn why ThoughtWorks says multi-cloud portability is best achieved through containers and learn more about how the industry is shifting towards Kubernetes for container management. This has lead to what Alex is coining Serverless 2.0 - a truly portable experience built on battle-tested technology.

**Stack Overflow: How We Do App Caching - 2019 Edition**  
https://nickcraver.com/blog/2019/08/06/stack-overflow-how-we-do-app-caching/  
So…caching. What is it? It’s a way to get a quick payoff by not re-calculating or fetching things over and over, resulting in performance and cost wins. That’s even where the name comes from, it’s a short form of the “ca-ching!” cash register sound from the dark ages of 2014 when physical currency was still a thing, before Apple Pay. I’m a dad now, deal with it. Let’s say we need to call an API or query a database server or just take a bajillion numbers (Google says that’s an actual word, I checked) and add them up. Those are all relatively crazy expensive. So we cache the result – we keep it handy for re-use.

**Unifying visual embeddings for visual search at Pinterest**

https://towardsdatascience.com/life-after-hadoop-getting-data-science-to-work-for-your-business-c9ab6605733f  
Traditional approaches like Apache Hadoop and CPU-based infrastructure aren’t up to the task — they pose too many bottlenecks and are too slow. NVIDIA and its partners are building GPU-based tools that let businesses unleash data science using AI. Below are five key elements to building AI-optimized data centers, but first let’s take a look at the crossroads data science is at.

**Build Your Own Text Editor**  
https://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo/index.html  
Welcome! This is an instruction booklet that shows you how to build a text editor in C. The text editor is [antirez’s kilo](http://antirez.com/news/108), with some changes.mI explain each step along the way, sometimes in a lot of detail. Feel free to skim or skip the prose, as the main point of this is that you are going to build a text editor from scratch! Anything you learn along the way is bonus, and there’s plenty to learn just from typing in the changes to the code and observing the results.

**How to Make Your Open Source Project Successful**  
https://dmitripavlutin.com/how-to-make-your-open-source-project-successful/  
I’ve built an open source library vocajs.com that managed to rise to the top trending repositories on GitHub. Along the way, I learned some important principles of how to make a quality open source project. I want to share these ideas:
- 1. No one cares about your project  
- 2. Solve a real problem  
- 3. Put an accent on quality  
- 4. Excellent README.md and documentation  
- 5. Showcase with demos and screenshots  
- 6. Try building a community  
- 7. Let the world know  

**All the best engineering advice I stole from non-technical people**  
https://medium.com/@bellmar/all-the-best-engineering-advice-i-stole-from-non-technical-people-eb7f90ca2f5f  
More often than not the best advice, the things that stuck with me, came from people who had no background at all in software. It’s intriguing that the stuff that really seems to make a difference in the quality of software never seems to be about software. These are five of my favorites: 1. “People like us make our money in the seams of things”; 2. “Know what people are asking you to be an expert in”; 3. “Before you can make things better, you have to stop making them worse”; 4. “To go left, turn right”; 5. “Thinking is also work”.

User experience (UX) design is the process of designing products that are useful, easy to use, and a pleasure to engage. It’s about enhancing the entire experience people have while interacting with a product and making sure they find value, satisfaction, and delight. If a mountain peak represents that goal, employing various UX research methods are the path UX designers use to get to the top of the mountain.

As you surf the web for news and insight, AI is learning what you like to read, how long you like to read for, and it probably even knows if you’re one of those people that read articles with your mouse cursor. And with that information that AI learns, companies are turning a profit. AI software like Google Ads and Facebook Ads select advertisements to show you based upon your habits. And I believe these AI are only going to become more advanced.
