**Announcing Visual Studio Online Public Preview**  
https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/announcing-visual-studio-online-public-preview/  
Available beginning at Microsoft’s Ignite conference as a public preview, Visual Studio Online provides managed, on-demand development environments that can be used for long-term projects, to quickly prototype a new feature, or for short-term tasks like reviewing pull requests. You can work with environments from anywhere using either Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio IDE (in private preview), or the included browser-based editor. 另附：[对话微软顶级代码女神潘正磊：Visual Studio 与 VS Code 的未来走向](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/LDi-hZ0gYEi3meoVkS2_dA), [Microsoft wants anyone to be a developer, whether they code or not](https://qz.com/1740052/microsoft-shares-plan-to-make-anyone-a-software-developer/), .

**Building Great User Experiences with Concurrent Mode and Suspense**  
https://reactjs.org/blog/2019/11/06/building-great-user-experiences-with-concurrent-mode-and-suspense.html  
This post will be most relevant to people working on data fetching libraries for React. It shows how to best integrate them with Concurrent Mode and Suspense. The patterns introduced here are based on Relay — our library for building data-driven UIs with GraphQL. However, the ideas in this post apply to other GraphQL clients as well as libraries using REST or other approaches. This post is aimed at library authors. If you’re primarily an application developer, you might still find some interesting ideas here, but don’t feel like you have to read it in its entirety. 另附：[The React Conf 2019 Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPxbbTqCLbGHPxZpw4xj_Wwg8-fdNxJRh)、[Great Content from JSConf Budapest 2019](https://blog.risingstack.com/jsconf-budapest-2019-videos/).

**NPM Updates to Community, Docs & more…**  
https://blog.npmjs.org/post/188841555980/updates-to-community-docs-more  
Here on the Community & Open Source Team we’ve been working hard, in front of and behind the scenes, to provide real value and unlock developer potential. With that in mind, I’m happy to announce a number of updates/releases we’ve landed this morning & would like to detail.

**解密国内BAT等大厂前端技术体系-腾讯篇**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/hisqcnv8g5XMOF6bzFV7pw  
腾讯给大家的感觉一直都是产品驱动、闷声发大财的样子，而且从技术方面由于有阿里、百度这类技术沉淀深厚的公司作为对比也没有给人留下深刻的印象。但是，最近几年随着微信平台的崛起，围绕微信平台的开发框架、跨端同构方面获得了比较大突破，同时，也举办例如TWeb conf、腾讯Live开发者大会，在业界的影响力也不断扩大。

**百度大规模战略性混部系统演进**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzUyMzA3MTY1NA==&mid=2247485311&idx=1&sn=7c759e199bf81fce4752501edb89235d  
将在线服务和离线任务混合混部到相同物理资源上，通过资源隔离、调度等控制手段 , 充分使用资源，同时保证服务的稳定性，我们称这样的技术为“混部”。百度从 2012 年就开始尝试进入混部技术领域，研发并推广了代理计算（BVC/IDLE）系统，大规模重构后演进成为一套通用的在离线混部系统（千寻）。目前公司混部的整体技术迈向成熟，并在大搜索、Feed、凤巢等机器上实现了规模化运用。本文整理自百度基础架构部资深研发工程师张慕华在 QCon 全球软件开发大会（北京站）2019 上的演讲，他主要介绍了百度在在离线混部系统架构的演进和实践。

**移动端体验优化经验总结与实践**  
https://github.com/ProtoTeam/blog/blob/master/201911/1.md  
如果产品不能让用户身心感到愉悦和舒适，他们很可能会迅速使用其他替代品，对于 toC 的产品尤为明显，产品体验糟糕必然会被市场淘汰。但是体验是一个很庞大的话题，有很多方面会影响产品的体验，如性能、UI、交互以及人性化的功能等等，本文抛砖引玉，只从技术层面的某几个方面聊聊移动端的体验优化，主要以 Android 为切入点，IOS 大部分优化方向与 Android 类似。考虑到市面上绝大多数 APP 都是 Native+H5 相结合的应用，且本人项目中也大量使用 H5 页面，因此将从 Native 端和 H5 端分别总结如何优化体验。

**How Gatsby can power your site offline - even without JavaScrip**  
https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/2019-11-05-how-gatsby-can-power-your-site-offline-even-without-javascript/  
You know the feeling: you saw a cool website or read an interesting article the other day, and you’d like to check back on it, or maybe you’re with some people that you’d like to share it with. But what’s this? You don’t have any phone signal, and the wi-fi connection is spotty at best – if there is one at all! You attempt to open the page, but try as you might, the loading spinner just keeps on spinning… With gatsby-plugin-offline, that’s a thing of the past.

**What I’ve learned about accessibility in SPAs**  
https://nolanlawson.com/2019/11/05/what-ive-learned-about-accessibility-in-spas/  
Over the past year or so, I’ve learned a lot about accessibility, mostly thanks to working on Pinafore, which is a Single Page App (SPA). In this post, I’d like to share some of the highlights of what I’ve learned, in the hope that it can help others who are trying to learn more about accessibility.

Working with Node.js streams is much more pleasant if we use asynchronous iteration. This blog post explores how to do that.

**Audio Fingerprinting using the AudioContext API**  
https://iq.opengenus.org/audio-fingerprinting/  
Fingerprinting as introduced in this article is a way of identifying users based on one or more set of unique device characteristics. Along with Canvas fingerprinting, Audio fingerpnting takes advantage of device performance specs to build up an identifying fingerprint of a user. The problem is it does not need to take any permission from the users and works on all browsers and can be used to track users across browsers. It has the same basic process of doing this as canvas fingerprinting. Assign a task to the browser, record how it is executed, and use such data to build the finge rprint.

**How to Build a Simple Video Converter with Node.js**  
https://levelup.gitconnected.com/how-to-build-a-simple-video-converter-52eaeaf248f1  
Videos are an incredibly popular medium for sharing information, but in the past, converting videos has always been a problem for people. With FFMPEG, this can now be solved easily.

Howdy, folks! Today we will be looking at the JavaScript code behind this amazing 3D tunnel effect. This code has an interesting lineage so we’ll also talk about some of the history behind it.

**Code Health: Respectful Reviews == Useful Reviews**  
https://testing.googleblog.com/2019/11/code-health-respectful-reviews-useful.html  
While code review is recognized as a valuable tool for improving the quality of software projects, code review comments that are perceived as being unclear or harsh can have unfavorable consequences: slow reviews, blocked dependent code reviews, negative emotions, or negative perceptions of other contributors or colleagues. Consider these tips to resolve code review comments respectfully.

**Building a Large-scale Distributed Storage System Based on Raft**  
https://www.cncf.io/blog/2019/11/04/building-a-large-scale-distributed-storage-system-based-on-raft/  
In recent years, building a large-scale distributed storage system has become a hot topic.  Distributed consensus algorithms like Paxos and Raft are the focus of many technical articles. But those articles tend to be introductory, describing the basics of the algorithm and log replication. They seldom cover how to build a large-scale distributed storage system based on the distributed consensus algorithm. In this article, I’d like to share some of our firsthand experience in designing a large-scale distributed storage system based on the Raft consensus algorithm.

**GraphQL Search Indexing**  
https://medium.com/netflix-techblog/graphql-search-indexing-334c92e0d8d5  
Almost a year ago we described our learnings from adopting GraphQL on the Netflix Marketing Tech team. We have a lot more to share since then! There are plenty of existing resources describing how to express a search query in GraphQL and paginate the results. This post looks at the other side of search: how to index data and make it searchable. Specifically, how our team uses the relationships and schemas defined within GraphQL to automatically build and maintain a search database.

**Optimizing Search Index Generation using secondary cache**  https://medium.com/walmartlabs/optimizing-search-index-generation-using-secondary-cache-172c085a636a  
To support the Walmart Search, a Full Index is generated periodically, and incremental updates are applied via real-time stream processing. Together they keep the Walmart search index current. The Full Index is implemented as a Spark based batch job, that does a full table scan on the underlying Item Store (Apache Cassandra). 

**Computers Evolve a New Path Toward Human Intelligence**  
https://www.quantamagazine.org/computers-evolve-a-new-path-toward-human-intelligence-20191106/  
Neural networks that borrow strategies from biology are making profound leaps in their abilities. Is ignoring a goal the best way to make truly intelligent machines?

**Scroll-To-Text using a URL fragment**  
https://github.com/WICG/ScrollToTextFragment  
To enable users to easily navigate to specific content in a web page, we propose adding support for specifying a text snippet in the URL. When navigating to such a URL, the browser will find the first instance of the text snippet in the page and bring it into view. Web standards currently specify support for scrolling to anchor elements with name attributes, as well as DOM elements with ids, when navigating to a fragment. While named anchors and elements with ids enable scrolling to limited specific parts of web pages, not all documents make use of these elements, and not all parts of pages are addressable by named anchors or elements with ids.

**Conversational Applications | the New Face of Your Apps**  
https://uxmag.com/articles/conversational-applications-the-new-face-of-your-apps  
Tech giants like Facebook, Google, and Baidu know that people aren’t filling their devices with apps anymore. Just 35 percent of smartphone users download a single app in an average month, and the average app loses 90 percent of its daily active users within 30 days of release. The future of technology is all about ease of use and “human” interactivity, and it’s why M has a host of competitors — WeChat, Siri, Google Now, Alexa, Duer, and Cortana, just to name a few — all vying to become consumers’ next favorite personal assistant and app home base.
