**A JavaScript-Free Frontend**  
https://dev.to/winduptoy/a-javascript-free-frontend-2d3e  
[Slimvoice](https://slimvoice.co/) - A Webapp Without JavaScript is a series where I document how I rebuilt my app, Slimvoice, using as little JavaScript as possible. I've tagged this series with JavaScript to present JavaScript alternatives and encourage those who reach for a SPA for every project to give it a second thought. 附：[译文](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzUxMzcxMzE5Ng==&mid=2247490736&idx=1&sn=75f32b013e527231ac2e7cdbd604940c).

未来浏览器会越来越重要，Web Os 的概念正在慢慢落地。另外三大框架趋于稳定，写法上也越来越像，学习成本是降低的。但周边应用层面的封装还会是爆发式增长，更多复杂的细节会被包装到应用框架里，可能还有很多不一样的开发方式需要大家熟悉。对于开发者而言，唯一不变的就是学习能力。掌握了学习能力就能够应对这些趋势变化，无论是在三大框架混战时代，还是后面周边封装时代都能很开心的“折腾”。哪怕有一天 AI 真的能够替人写代码，能应变的人自然也是不怕的。

**工程师看得懂的商业原理、商业变迁史**

**精读《Serverless 给前端带来了什么》**  
https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/58877583  
Serverless 是一种 “无服务器架构”，让用户无需关心程序运行环境、资源及数量，只要将精力 Focus 到业务逻辑上的技术。 现在公司已经实现 DevOps 化，正在向 Serverless 迈进，而为什么前端要关注 Serverless？

**A Complete Guide to useEffect**  
https://overreacted.io/a-complete-guide-to-useeffect/  
The goal of this article isn’t to give you a list of bullet point recipes. It’s to help you truly “grok” useEffect. There won’t be much to learn. In fact, we’ll spend most of our time unlearning. 另附：[Scheduling in React](https://philippspiess.com/scheduling-in-react/).

**Building Angular and React Applications Together With Nx**  
https://blog.nrwl.io/building-angular-and-react-applications-together-with-nx-78b5578de598  
Large companies often use multiple frontend frameworks to build their products. One product can be built with Angular, another one with React. These products, even though are built by different teams using different stacks, often share components and utilities. Setting this up traditionally is challenging. Companies put a lot of effort in making sure teams can collaborate and use each other’s work. Nx drastically simplifies this.

**Flutter’s Key Difference: Owning Every Pixel**  
https://medium.com/flutter-community/flutters-key-difference-owning-every-pixel-e2135b44c8a  
There’s been plenty of comparing Flutter with other cross-platform mobile frameworks. But the key difference is often overlooked or downplayed. Flutter owns every pixel on the screen.

**Why you shouldn't use Moment.js...**  
https://inventi.studio/en/blog/why-you-shouldnt-use-moment-js  
JavaScript's built-in Date object is far from ideal, let's admit it. We could spend a lot of time talking about Date API methods like getYear, however we believe everything has been told in that matter. Everyone of us, at some point realized that or has been warned by older friends, if lucky enough. Whatever the reason was, at the end we all reached for external library and the choice was obvious - Moment.js. The most popular JS DateTime library that gave us everything we wanted so much from native Date API.

**Designing An Aspect Ratio Unit For CSS**  
https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2019/03/aspect-ratio-unit-css/  
The CSS Working Group have designed an aspect ratio unit for CSS. While this isn’t in browsers yet, this article takes a look at the process of designing a new sizing method and explains how it will work.

**Writing CSS Algorithms**  
https://notlaura.com/writing-css-algorithms/  
A CSS algorithm is a well-defined declaration or set of declarations that produces a specific styling output.

**Fast, Bump-Allocated Virtual DOMs with Rust and Wasm**  
https://hacks.mozilla.org/2019/03/fast-bump-allocated-virtual-doms-with-rust-and-wasm/  
Dodrio is a virtual DOM library written in Rust and WebAssembly. It takes advantage of both Wasm’s linear memory and Rust’s low-level control by designing virtual DOM rendering around bump allocation. Preliminary benchmark results suggest it has best-in-class performance.

**KV Storage: the Web's First Built-in Module**  
https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2019/03/kv-storage  
Chrome is experimenting with a new feature known as built-in modules, and the first one we're planning to ship is an asynchronous key/value storage module called KV Storage.

**Update on Experimental Features in Node.js**  
https://nodesource.com/blog/experimental-features-in-node.js  
A lot of experimental features get to the stable phase, like HTTP2, where it first landed as an experimental feature in Node v8.4.0 and then became stable in Node v10. But also, some other experimental features get deprecated.

**When "Zoë" !== "Zoë". Or why you need to normalize Unicode strings**

Never heard of Unicode normalization? You’re not alone. But it will save you a lot of trouble.

**Give Me Back My Monolith**  
http://www.craigkerstiens.com/2019/03/13/give-me-back-my-monolith/  
It feels like we’re starting to pass the peak of the hype cycle of microservices. It’s no longer multiple times a week we now see a blog post of “How I migrated my monolith to 150 services”. Now I often hear a bit more of the counter: “I don’t hate my monolith, I just care that things stay performant”. We’ve actually seen some migrations from micro-services back to a monolith. When you go from one large application to multiple smaller services there are a number of new things you have to tackle, here is a rundown of all the things that were simple that you now get to re-visit.

**Visualizing Cold Starts**  
https://mikhail.io/2019/03/visualizing-cold-starts/  
I wrote a lot about cold starts of serverless functions. The articles are full of charts and numbers which are hopefully useful but might be hard to internalize. I decided to come up with a way to represent colds starts visually.

**Reinventing Facebook’s data center network**  
https://code.fb.com/data-center-engineering/f16-minipack/  
Because of these dual pressures of increasing demand and physical constraints, we decided to rethink and transform our data center network from top to bottom, from topologies to the fundamental building blocks used within them. In this post, we’ll share the story of this transformation over the last two years.

**Amazon Aurora ascendant: How we designed a cloud-native relational database**  
https://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2019/03/Amazon-Aurora-design-cloud-native-relational-database.html  
Aurora's design preserves the core transactional consistency strengths of relational databases. It innovates at the storage layer to create a database built for the cloud that can support modern workloads without sacrificing performance. Customers love this because Aurora provides the performance and availability of commercial grade databases at 1/10th the cost. Since Aurora's original release, it has been the fastest-growing service in the history of AWS. In this post, I'd like to give you a peek under the hood at how we built Aurora. I'll also discuss why customers are adopting it faster than any other service in AWS history.

**Iodide: an experimental tool for scientific communication and exploration on the web**  
https://hacks.mozilla.org/2019/03/iodide-an-experimental-tool-for-scientific-communicatiodide-for-scientific-communication-exploration-on-the-web/  
In the last 10 years, there has been an explosion of interest in “scientific computing” and “data science”: that is, the application of computation to answer questions and analyze data in the natural and social sciences. To address these needs, we’ve seen a renaissance in programming languages, tools, and techniques that help scientists and researchers explore and understand data and scientific concepts, and to communicate their findings. But to date, very few tools have focused on helping scientists gain unfiltered access to the full communication potential of modern web browsers. So today we’re excited to introduce [Iodide](http://iodide.io/), an experimental tool meant to help scientists write beautiful interactive documents using web technologies, all within an iterative workflow that will be familiar to many scientists. 另附：[Introducing Firefox Send](https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2019/03/12/introducing-firefox-send-providing-free-file-transfers-while-keeping-your-personal-information-private/).

**The ACME Protocol is an IETF Standard**  
https://letsencrypt.org/2019/03/11/acme-protocol-ietf-standard.html  
It has long been a dream of ours for there to be a standardized protocol for certificate issuance and management. That dream has become a reality now that the IETF has standardized the ACME protocol as [RFC 8555](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8555). I’d like to thank everyone involved in that effort, including Let’s Encrypt staff and other IETF contributors.

**Sucrase**  
https://github.com/alangpierce/sucrase  
Sucrase is an alternative to Babel that allows super-fast development builds. Instead of compiling a large range of JS features to be able to work in Internet Explorer, Sucrase assumes that you're developing with a recent browser or recent Node.js version, so it focuses on compiling non-standard language extensions: JSX, TypeScript, and Flow. Sucrase is about 20x faster than Babel.

**XXH3 - a new speed-optimized hash algorithm**  
https://fastcompression.blogspot.com/2019/03/presenting-xxh3.html  
The xxHash family of hash functions has proven more successful than anticipated. Initially designed as a checksum companion for LZ4, it has found its way into many more projects, requiring vastly different workloads. I was recently summoned to investigate performance for a bloom filter implementation, requiring to generate quickly 64 pseudo-random bits from small inputs of variable length. The end result of this investigation is XXH3, a cross-over inspired by many other great hash algorithms, which proves substantially faster than existing variants of xxHash, across basically all dimensions.

**Announcing the release of sway 1.0**  
https://drewdevault.com/2019/03/11/Sway-1.0-released.html  
1,315 days after I started the sway project, it’s finally time for sway 1.0! I had no idea at the time how much work I was in for, or how many talented people would join and support the project with me. In order to complete this project, we have had to rewrite the entire Linux desktop nearly from scratch. Nearly 300 people worked together, together writing over 9,000 commits and almost 100,000 lines of code, to bring you this release. Sway is an i3-compatible Wayland desktop for Linux and FreeBSD. 1.0 is the first stable release of sway and represents a consistent, flexible, and powerful desktop environment for Linux and FreeBSD.
