We'll be diving deep into what it means to build a fast, high quality web experience using modern web technologies and best practices, as well as looking at the new and exciting capabilities coming to the web platform. 另附：[Elevating the Web Together](https://blog.chromium.org/2019/11/chrome-dev-summit-2019-elevating-web.html), [Making new experiences possible on the web](https://blog.chromium.org/2019/11/making-new-experiences-possible-on-web.html), [Moving towards a faster web](https://blog.chromium.org/2019/11/moving-towards-faster-web.html).

**New from Universe 2019: GitHub for mobile, GitHub Archive Program, and more**  
https://github.blog/2019-11-13-universe-day-one/  
https://github.com/mobile  
https://archiveprogram.github.com/  
It’s our favorite time of year: GitHub Universe gives us all two days to celebrate 40+ million developers and their contributions to the open source community. In the past year alone, over 10 million developers have joined from nearly three million organizations in over 70 countries. We also made several exciting announcements.

**WaterfallProcess**  
https://martinfowler.com/bliki/WaterfallProcess.html  
In the software world, “waterfall” is commonly used to describe a style of software process, one that contrasts with the ideas of iterative, or agile styles. Like many well-known terms in software it's meaning is ill-defined and origins are obscure - but I find its essential theme is breaking down a large effort into phases based on activity.

**Build your own React**  
https://pomb.us/build-your-own-react/  
We are going to rewrite React from scratch. Step by step. Following the architecture from the real React code but without all the optimizations and non-essential features. If you’ve read any of my previous “build your own React” posts, the difference is that this post is based on React 16.8, so we can now use hooks and drop all the code related to classes.

**How Concurrent React changes the game for data-heavy UI**

**OutSystems UI Framework: Past, Present, and Future**  
https://www.outsystems.com/blog/posts/ui-framework-future/  
With the release of OutSystems UI, a single UI framework that supports both mobile and web applications, we took a significant step towards achieving our vision for the front-end of the platform. Launching this unified framework was a very challenging process, and here I’ll provide a developer’s perspective of what was the past and present, and what you may expect from future UIs at OutSystems.

**Responsible JavaScript: Part III**  
https://alistapart.com/article/responsible-javascript-part-3/

**How Discord achieves native iOS performance with React Native**  
https://blog.discordapp.com/how-discord-achieves-native-ios-performance-with-react-native-390c84dcd502  
We knew that our app was once fast, and we wanted to more deeply understand if the problems we were seeing could be tackled on our end, or if the issue was more deeply rooted in React Native itself. With this in mind, we created a mobile performance squad, whose mission was to execute a deep dive into driving top tier performance on across all supported iOS devices. We would like to share what we have learned! 另附：[Microsoft looks to React Native as a way to tackle the cross-platform development puzzle](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2019/11/07/microsoft_react_native/).

**Semantic sidenotes for the web**  
https://www.kooslooijesteijn.net/blog/semantic-sidenotes  
On this website, sidenotes appear next to the article when there’s enough space. On small screens, they’re hidden by default and can be made visible with a tap. The problem is, it’s hard to find a properly semantic HTML solution to do this.

**instant.page 3.0 — incorporating the best from quicklink**  
https://instant.page/v3  
instant.page makes your site’s pages instant — in 1 minute of effort — by preloading pages right before a user clicks on them: when they hover over a link for 65 ms; there’s one chance out of two that they will click then. On mobile, it preloads when they start touching their display, before releasing it.

https://medium.com/netflix-techblog/page-simulator-fa02069fb269  
At Netflix, we spend a lot of effort to make it easy for our members to find content they will love. To make this happen, we personalize many aspects of our service, including which movies and TV shows we present on each member’s homepage. Over the years, we have built a recommendation system that uses many different machine learning algorithms to create these personalized recommendations.

**Why is the Migration to Python 3 Taking So Long?**  
https://stackoverflow.blog/2019/11/14/why-is-the-migration-to-python-3-taking-so-long/  
In Pycon in 2014, Guido van Rossum, the creator of Python and, at the time, the Benevolent Dictator For Life of the language, stood on stage in a shirt that had a large 2.8 written on it in block letters, with a big red no entry sign through it. “It’s time to move on to Python 3,” he said, telling the audience that they should start adopting the new version of the language into their workflows. 另附：[My Python Development Environment, 2020 Edition](https://jacobian.org/2019/nov/11/python-environment-2020/).

**chart-parts - A flexible, React-friendly, Grammar of Graphics for data visualization**  
https://microsoft.github.io/chart-parts/  
The vision of chart-parts is to implement a grammar of graphics in JavaScript in a flexible, architecture-agnostic way while dovetailing nicely with frameworks application developers use such as React. To date, implementations of the Grammar of Graphics have tended to exist as closed systems. While a closed system can be useful for certain categories of users, we believe that these systems should provide escape hatches and flexibility.

HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and SVG (scalable graphics) seem to be the best solutions for web animation. Using these modern web technologies and languages will help tackle most, but not all, of the above problems. But it’s always a good idea to tread carefully, especially when in uncharted territory, and extensive QA and testing is a must.

**21岁的腾讯，价值观变了！任宇昕与张小龙在思考什么**
