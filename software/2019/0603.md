**Is High Quality Software Worth the Cost?**  
https://martinfowler.com/articles/is-quality-worth-cost.html  
A common debate in software development projects is between spending time on improving the quality of the software versus concentrating on releasing more valuable features. Usually the pressure to deliver functionality dominates the discussion, leading many developers to complain that they don't have time to work on architecture and code quality. Although most of my writing is aimed at professional software developers, for this article I'm not going to assume any knowledge of the mechanics of software development. My hope is that this is an article that can be valuable to anyone involved with thinking about software efforts, particularly those, such as business leaders, that act as customers of software development teams.

**Why I'm still using jQuery in 2019**  
https://arp242.net/jquery.html  
I’m not married to jQuery, and I’ll happily use a “jQuery light” which patches over the JS API with something more palatable. YMNJQ recommends bonzo and $dom, and several others for AJAX and such, but many seem unmaintained. Besides, everyone already knows jQuery. Why replace it with something else unless there’s a compelling reason to?

**Version 8 of Angular — Smaller bundles, CLI APIs, and alignment with the ecosystem**  
https://blog.angular.io/version-8-of-angular-smaller-bundles-cli-apis-and-alignment-with-the-ecosystem-af0261112a27  
This is a major release spanning the entire platform, including the framework, Angular Material, and the CLI with synchronized major versions. This release improves application startup time on modern browsers, provides new APIs for tapping into the CLI, and aligns Angular to the ecosystem and more web standards.

**Ant Design 4.0 进行时！**  
https://www.yuque.com/ant-design/ant-design/antd4-in-progress  
Ant Design 于 17 年 12 月发布 3.0 以来，已经经历了 16 个月的时间。在此期间，我们修复了海量 Bug、以及增加大量新功能（更新日志）。我们也发布了 Ant Design Pro 4.0。支持了 TypeScript、区块以及对布局进行抽象。与此同时，我们也在思考下一步是什么，如何才能使 Ant Design 走的更远，我们预计在今年 Q4 发布 Ant Design 4.0 版本。以下是关于 4.0 的详细计划，当然这仍在计划中。正式发布时可能会有调整。

**前端开发 20 年变迁史**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/yNg7Q0XNLJMnqffTIJhNUg  
在这将近20年的前端发展史中，我们经历了从最早的纯静态页面，到JavaScript跨时代的诞生；从PC端到移动端；从依赖后端到前端可自由打包开发；从早期的网景Navigator浏览器到现在各家浏览器百花齐放……我们经历了前端的洪荒时代、Prototype时代、jQuery时代 、后jQuery时期、三大框架割据时代，这其中均是由国外开发者主导，直到如今的小程序时代，才是中国开发者独创的。

**The dangerous folly of “Software as a Service”**  
http://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=8338  
Comes the word that Saleforce.com has announced a ban on its customers selling “military-style rifles”. The reason this ban has teeth is that the company provides “software as a service”; that is, the software you run is a client for servers that the provider owns and operates. If the provider decides it doesn’t want your business, you probably have no real recourse. OK, you could sue for tortious interference in business relationships, but that’s chancy and anyway you didn’t want to be in a lawsuit, you wanted to conduct your business.

**Building Facebook’s service encryption infrastructure**  
https://code.fb.com/security/service-encryption/  
We previously explained how we implement Transport Layer Security (TLS) on the public internet, including our Fizz library and our pilot project for DNS over TLS. In this post, we’ll talk about how we migrated our encryption infrastructure in data centers from the Kerberos authentication protocol to TLS. Optimizing for operability and performance, while still satisfying the right security model for each service, required navigating difficult trade-offs. By sharing our experiences, we hope to show how we think about our encryption infrastructure and help others as they think through their own implementation.

**Simplifying event-driven architectures with the latest updates to Event Grid**  
https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/simplifying-event-driven-architectures-with-the-latest-updates-to-event-grid/  
Event-driven architectures are increasingly replacing and outpacing less dynamic polling-based systems, bringing the benefits of serverless computing to IoT scenarios, data processing tasks or infrastructure automation jobs. As the natural evolution of microservices, companies all over the world are taking an event-driven approach to create new experiences in existing applications or bring those applications to the cloud, building more powerful and complex scenarios every day. Today, we’re incredibly excited to announce a series of updates to Event Grid that will power higher performance and more advanced event-driven applications in the cloud.

**Exploring Domain-Driven Design at CircleCI**  
https://circleci.com/blog/exploring-domain-driven-design-at-circleci/  
My team at CircleCI, which focuses on plans and payments, has gone through many organizational changes over the last year as we’ve grown.One thing that has helped us maintain a sense of consistency throughout these changes is to adopt a different approach to writing software: Domain-Driven Design, also known as DDD.

**Our not-so-magic journey scaling low latency, multi-region services on AWS**  
https://www.atlassian.com/blog/technology/aws-scaling-multi-region-low-latency-service  
Atlassian went “all in” on AWS in 2016 and they continue to be our preferred cloud provider. The extent of that migration was covered from a high-level in this article. But what we didn’t cover in that piece was the number of services we needed to modify or build to be stateless.

**A Look at MetricsDB: A Time Series Database for Storing Metrics at Twitter**  
https://blog.twitter.com/engineering/en_us/topics/infrastructure/2019/metricsdb.html  
Twitter’s time series ingestion service is handling 83 million metrics a second and to scale into the future, they had to seek a new approach. MetricsDB, which went live in 2017, gives an overall cost reduction of 10x and latency by 5x compared to traditional key value stores.

**Researching AI and Machine Learning for the Future of Low-Code**  
https://www.outsystems.com/blog/posts/ai-machine-learning-future-low-code/  
In this article, I want to talk through the unique research challenges presented by AI/ML, particularly when you’re dealing with code. Additionally, I’ll cover why our investment in internal research teams and collaborations with institutions like Carnegie Mellon University are so important to developing truly capable machine-learning-powered AI development assistants.

**Core Go Developers Respond to Queries Over Who Go Really 'Belongs' To**  
https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/golang-nuts/6dKNSN0M_kg/EUzcym2FBAAJ  
Russ Cox’s response: There are certainly senses in which Go is Google's language: it was created at Google, Google continues to fund most of the development, and a few people at Google are the final deciders about the language itself. But I disagree with the “not ours:” I think Go is also the Go community's language.

**Daily Ethical Design**  
https://alistapart.com/article/daily-ethical-design/  
As designers, we’re optimists by nature. We see the world as a set of problems that we can solve systematically and creatively if only we try hard enough. We intend well. However, merely having the intention to do good is not going to be enough. Our mindset comes with the pitfall of (dis)missing potential disastrous consequences, especially under pressure of daily constraints. That’s why we need to regularly, systematically take a step back and consider the future impact of our work. My hope is that the practical, structural mindset to ethics introduced in this article will help us agree on a higher standard for design.

**GDPR After One Year: Costs and Unintended Consequences**  
https://truthonthemarket.com/2019/05/24/gdpr-after-one-year-costs-and-unintended-consequences/  
GDPR is officially one year old. How have the first 12 months gone? As you can see from the mix of data and anecdotes below, it appears that compliance costs have been astronomical; individual “data rights” have led to unintended consequences; “privacy protection” seems to have undermined market competition; and there have been large unseen — but not unmeasurable! — costs in forgone startup investment. So, all-in-all, about what we expected.

**关于芯片之争，终于有人说出了本质**

在中国和“外国”这两国的较量中，究竟哪一国更占上风？有说中国吊打外国，有说外国轻松把中国摁在地上摩擦，双方都列举了林林总总的例子，整得我们吃瓜群众一脸懵逼。当然，中间派肯定说两国各有利弊，但这结论虽然正确却没啥营养。想要在中外两国这个话题上显得有见识，得先搞明白啥是技术？

当你对自己利益很满意，也想“顺便”对用户好一点的时候，是不会懂什么叫“以客户为中心”的。那什么叫“以客户为中心”？只有当你的利益，和客户的利益不一致时，才会明白你到底把谁当做中心。

谈及商业设计，张勇首先抛出了企业一号位面临的首要问题——“我的客户是谁？”并告诫这些头部企业时代会发生变化，一定要不断挑战自我，挑战自己已经习惯的模式，不断问自己为什么不能是另外一种方式。而组织设计部分，张勇分享了设计的关键点——在特定的时间点，纵横、分合如何选择。在他看来，所有组织设计都是为特定的战略目标服务，讲清楚我要解决什么问题，当前的首要矛盾是什么。他并不认同团队任何时候都讲究协同，而是认为没有竞争的团队不是一个好团队，没有杀性的leader不是一个好leader。

说到数据和智能，玩得最六的肯定是巨头 BAT，在过去漫长的时光里，我们好像没听说 BAT 深度切入教育领域，这是为个啥？在我看来，原因很简单：教育和医疗，无论在哪个国家都不是纯市场化的行业。国家不会要求公立学校自负盈亏，教育局和高校也不会用“钱生钱”的逻辑来投资软硬件建设。说白了，教育行业就不是个适合“捞金”的地方。所以，巨头如果要进入教育，不仅要舍得花钱，也不仅要有技术，更重要的也许是反商业逻辑的勇气、决心和情怀。今天的主角是腾讯。2019年5月22日，腾讯高调宣布整合教育品牌，集结了队伍进军教育主战场。在马化腾高喊的“科技向善”愿景上，又撒上了一层追光。另附：[网易有道的决心：“All In K12”，掷注大班课](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzU1Mjc4NjM4Mg==&mid=2247499220&idx=1&sn=45cde441d52be757e2993a20daf2bd9d)、[未来十年将会是AI影响教育的十年](https://new.qq.com/omn/20190530/20190530A04VOW00)、[松鼠 AI 周伟：站在教育本质，重新思考技术的未来](http://www.geekpark.net/news/242647).
