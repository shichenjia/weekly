**From design patterns to category theory**  
https://blog.ploeh.dk/2017/10/04/from-design-patterns-to-category-theory/  
Design Patterns was a great effort in 1994, and I've personally benefited from it. The catalogue was an attempt to discover good abstractions. What's a good abstraction? As already quoted, it's a model that amplifies the essentials, etcetera. I think a good abstraction should also be intuitive. What's the most intuitive abstractions ever? Mathematics.

**Micro Frontends**  
https://martinfowler.com/articles/micro-frontends.html  
Good frontend development is hard. Scaling frontend development so that many teams can work simultaneously on a large and complex product is even harder. In this article we'll describe a recent trend of breaking up frontend monoliths into many smaller, more manageable pieces, and how this architecture can increase the effectiveness and efficiency of teams working on frontend code. As well as talking about the various benefits and costs, we'll cover some of the implementation options that are available, and we'll dive deep into a full example application that demonstrates the technique. 另附：[Microfrontends: the good, the bad, and the ugly](https://zendev.com/2019/06/17/microfrontends-good-bad-ugly.html).

**Why tools like Flutter need to succeed**  
https://chimon.hashnode.dev/why-tools-like-flutter-need-to-succeed-cjw23fso8000gn9s1p5t78gfd  
Flutter started as an experiment to see what Chrome would look like as a development ecosystem without the technical debt accumulated over the years. It was carefully constructed based on the past learnings of several minds that spent the better parts of their careers contributing to the web platform. These engineers are passionate about both the tools and the community that they are building. 另附：[How Much Does It Cost to Develop a React Native Mobile App?](https://blog.bitsrc.io/how-much-does-it-cost-to-develop-a-react-native-mobile-app-1e555f872d65)、[The Power of the Flutter’s Transform and GestureDetector Widgets](https://medium.com/flutter/the-power-of-the-flutters-transform-and-gesturedetector-widgets-6834f5a25be9).

**The future of React, unfolding with Suspense**  
https://blog.logrocket.com/the-future-of-react-unfolding-with-suspense/  
This won’t be just another article on how to write Hooks, but rather what to expect in the future of React! If you have never heard of Hooks, or any other new API in React, this article will be a great start to get you excited about the future.

**我叫死月，我在蚂蚁写 Node.js**  
https://www.yuque.com/xadillax/koumakan/xadillax-in-alipay  
前两天，我因为知乎上一个中二魂满满的问题《为什么强如『死月』在阿里也只有 P6？》而躺枪。没错，我就是故事里的男主角。本来一开始我还没当一回事，但自从 Winter、贺老、狼叔等人回了这个问题之后，就一发不可收拾。本来我不是很想回答这个问题的，毕竟是天外飞锅，但是后来想想，借这个机会自我批判一番也挺好，看看是否能“洗刷”一下自己“网红”的名头。其实我对“网红”还是略有排斥的，一个是本身我就是一个小透明，另一个总觉得现如今意义上“网红”总归不是一个很好的褒义词。于是，搞了篇文章，在批判之余，我也为自己正个名。

**从9102年的CSS状态报告中看CSS特性的使用**  
https://www.w3cplus.com/css/2019-state-of-css.html  
在9102年终于有了一份属于 [CSS状态的报告](https://2019.stateofcss.com/)。对，这是CSS发展20多年以来第一份属于自己的状态报告。大家的印象中可能只有JavaScript相关的状态报告，对于CSS的状态报告并无了解（那是以前没有）。正如报告开篇所说，在Web开发家族中，JavaScript更似一位愤怒、叛逆的少年，每年都会经历一个新阶段。而CSS却一直以来更似一位勤奋好学，举止得体的少年，他总是保持礼貌，从不草率的做出任何决定。

**Drawing Realistic Clouds with SVG and CSS**  
https://css-tricks.com/drawing-realistic-clouds-with-svg-and-css/  
For this article, we will focus on learning to use these SVG filters to get spectacular results. We don’t need to delve too deeply into what is happening behind the scenes algorithmically, much in the way an artist isn’t required know the molecular structure of paint to render a stunning landscape.

**Styling In Modern Web Apps**  
https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2019/06/styling-modern-web-apps/  
In this article, we welcome you to take a detailed dive into the different ways of organizing styling in modern applications which often have complex interfaces and design patterns. Let’s walk through BEM, preprocessors, CSS-in-JS and even design systems to find out what works best for you.

**Video Upload Latency Improvements at Instagram**  
https://instagram-engineering.com/video-upload-latency-improvements-at-instagram-bcf4b4c5520a  
In June 2013 Instagram introduced video uploads. At the time the system was simple. To ingest video and make it available for playback, we had the Instagram app upload the entire video file to the server once the client had finished recording it. Then we would transcode the video to a controlled set of video versions of different qualities to make sure the video file was playable on as many devices as possible. Once all the video versions were available, we “published” the video and made it available for viewing.

**A Look Back At WWDC 2019**

**When should you be using Web Workers?**  
https://dassur.ma/things/when-workers/  
You should always use Web Workers. And in our current landscape of frameworks it’s virtually impossible.

**The reduce ({...spread}) anti-pattern**  
https://www.richsnapp.com/blog/2019/06-09-reduce-spread-anti-pattern  
reduce ...spread belongs to a different complexity class than the optimal solutions, which is bad.
javascript engines will probably never optimize this code.
if you're using reduce ...spread for reasons of immutability, you should copy once or use immutable helper libraries.

**Observable’s not JavaScript**  
https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/observables-not-javascript  
At first glance, Observable appears to be vanilla JavaScript. This is intentional: by building on the native language of the web, Observable is more familiar and you can use the libraries you know and love, such as D3, Three, and TensorFlow. Yet for dataflow, Observable needed to change JavaScript in a few ways.

**Software below the poverty line**  
https://staltz.com/software-below-the-poverty-line.html  
I decided to collect data from OpenCollective and GitHub, and take a more scientific sample of the situation. The results I found were shocking: there were two clearly sustainable open source projects, but the majority (more than 80%) of projects that we usually consider sustainable are actually receiving income below industry standards or even below the poverty threshold.

**Five Things You Can Do with Serverless**  
https://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/5-Things/Five-Things-You-Can-Do-with-Serverless  
Serverless is like CrossFit: The first rule is to never stop talking about it. In this episode, Eduardo Laureano from the Azure Functions team brings you five things you can do with Serverless that you might not realize are even possible. Also, Burke wears a sweater vest and Eduardo insinuates that there is a better candy than Goo Goo Clusters. The nerve. 

**RSocket: Solving Real-World Architectural Challenges**

Ondrej Lehecka of Facebook, Robert Roeser of Netifi, and Andy Shi of Alibaba explain the use cases for RSocket within their companies, as well as how it can be used by enterprises to simplify the way they build and operate cloud-native applications.

**You (probably) don’t need ReCAPTCHA**  
https://kevv.net/you-probably-dont-need-recaptcha/  
Google’s ReCAPTCHA is often the first tool that many webmasters reach for when confronted with the need to stop spam and automated malicious traffic from harming their services. In this post I explain several reasons why ReCAPTCHA is usually not the best solution to use for this purpose, as it is often unnecessary, inconveniences users, and subjects users to intensive tracking and fingerprinting that they are not able to opt-out of. Several alternative solutions to ReCAPTCHA for various threat models are presented as well as best practices for implementing captchas in general.

**Lerner — using RL agents for test case scheduling**  
https://medium.com/netflix-techblog/lerner-using-rl-agents-for-test-case-scheduling-3e0686211198  
The Partner Device Ecosystem organization in Netflix is responsible for ensuring successful integration and testing of the Netflix application on all partner devices. Netflix engineers run a series of tests and benchmarks to validate the device across multiple dimensions including compatibility of the device with the Netflix SDK, device performance, audio-video playback quality, license handling, encryption and security. All this leads to a plethora of test cases, most of them automated, that need to be executed to validate the functionality of a device running Netflix.

**From Jupyter Notebook to Fully Scalable Model—Now a Reality**  
https://blog.algorithmia.com/from-jupyter-notebook-to-fully-scalable-model-now-a-reality/  
When we work in Jupyter Notebook—an open-source project tool used for creating and sharing documents that contain live code snippets, visualizations, and markdown text—we are reminded how easy it is to use our API to deploy a machine learning model from within a notebook.

**The Wolfram Function Repository: Launching an Open Platform for Extending the Wolfram Language**  
https://blog.stephenwolfram.com/2019/06/the-wolfram-function-repository-launching-an-open-platform-for-extending-the-wolfram-language/  
The Wolfram Function Repository is something that’s made possible by the unique nature of the Wolfram Language as not just a programming language, but a full-scale computational language. In a traditional programming language, adding significant new functionality typically involves building whole libraries, which may or may not work together. 

**A bird's eye view of Go**  
https://blog.merovius.de/2019/06/12/birdseye-go.html  
I provide a very high-level overview of what Go-the-language means vs. Go-the-ecosystem vs. Go-an-implementation. I also try to provide specific references to what documentation is most useful for what purpose. See the bottom-most section for that. 另附：[GoJay](https://github.com/francoispqt/gojay).
