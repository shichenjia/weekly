**I Used The Web For A Day On Internet Explorer 8**  
https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2019/03/web-on-internet-explorer-ie8/  
This article is part of a series in which I attempt to use the web under various constraints, representing a given demographic of user. I hope to raise the profile of difficulties faced by real people, which are avoidable if we design and develop in a way that is sympathetic to their needs. Last time, I navigated the web for a day using a screen reader. This time, I spent the day using Internet Explorer 8, which was released ten years ago today, on March 19th, 2009.

做技术的人日复一日地沉浸于创造，点滴的进步终会汇聚成真实的变革。其实知识始终都在那里，只不过你把它做成什么样的形式，去展现出来。

**学不进去，没时间学怎么办？**  
https://www.zhangxinxu.com/life/2019/03/study/  
招聘高峰季，最近面试了一些人，聊到关于学习话题的时候，发现很多人有学不进去，没时间学的问题，加上之前断断续续有很多人咨询我关于如何学习的问题，我觉得可以好好讲讲我对于学习这件事的一些经验和看法。这些经验与看法不局限于IT技术的学习。

**Web端H.265播放器研发解密**  
http://taobaofed.org/blog/2019/03/18/web-player-h265/  音视频编解码对于前端工程师是一个比较少涉足的领域，涉及到流媒体技术中的文本、图形、图像、音频和视频多种理论知识的学习，才能够应用到具体实践中，我们自研web播放器并支持h.265解码，在码率优化的大背景下（保持画质不变情况下，应用图像增强、roi区域检测、智能场景分类和h265编解码等多种技术能力，将码流降低50%。达到减少带宽成本，提升视频服务QoE的目的），真正做到了h265解码播放的全域覆盖。本文主要分享了我们基于WebAssembly实现H.265格式的解封装、解码和播放。

**从技术演变的角度看互联网后台架构**  
https://cloud.tencent.com/developer/article/1404117  
这个ppt的初衷是希望从近十多年来不同时代不同热点下技术栈的变化来看看我们是如何从最早的php/asp/jsp<=>mysql这样的两层架构，一个阶段一个阶段演变到现在繁复的大数据、机器学习、消息驱动、微服务架构这样的体系，然后在针对其中比较重要的几个方面来给新入门后台开发的同学起个“提纲目录”的作用。

**Writing Resilient Components**  
https://overreacted.io/writing-resilient-components/  
When people start learning React, they often ask for a style guide. While it’s a good idea to have some consistent rules applied across a project, a lot of them are arbitrary — and so React doesn’t have a strong opinion about them. You can use different type systems, prefer function declarations or arrow functions, sort your props in alphabetical order or in an order you find pleasing. This flexibility allows integrating React into projects with existing conventions. But it also invites endless debates.

**How To Implement Smooth Transitions in React**  
https://blog.bitsrc.io/how-to-implement-smooth-transitions-in-react-bd0497b06b8

**I Don’t Hate Arrow Functions**  
https://davidwalsh.name/i-dont-hate-arrow-functions  
Arrow functions are fine for certain usages, but they have so many variations that they need to be carefully controlled to not break down the readability of the code.

**A complete guide to threads in Node.js**  
https://blog.logrocket.com/a-complete-guide-to-threads-in-node-js-4fa3898fe74f  
Back-end languages, which generally support multithreading, have all kinds of mechanisms for syncing values between threads and other thread-oriented features. To add support for such things to JavaScript would require changing the entire language, which wasn’t really Dahl’s goal. For plain JavaScript to support multithreading, he had to create a workaround. Let’s explore.

**关于“Open” Distro、开源和公司建设的几点思考**  
https://www.elastic.co/cn/blog/on-open-distros-open-source-and-building-a-company  
我在 2009 年坐下来编写了 Elasticsearch 最初的几行代码，并以开源方式提供给用户。因此我放弃了原来的工作，花了两年时间开发产品并围绕这些产品打造杰出的社区。在 2012 年，我们围绕所开发的产品创建了公司：Elastic。我们投入巨大精力维持用户社区，并且采用围绕这一社区而开发的开源产品生态系统。Elastic 关注的焦点始终是：开发强大的产品，围绕这些产品构建社区，并帮助用户实现成功。另附：[Henry Zhu, a core maintainer of Babel: Open Source Is About One’s Soul Searching and Moving the Whole Community](https://medium.com/@amsterdamjs/henry-zhu-open-source-is-about-ones-soul-searching-and-moving-the-whole-community-6a087cf3d003)

**GitLab 11.9 released with secrets detection and multiple MR approval rules**  
https://about.gitlab.com/2019/03/22/gitlab-11-9-released/  
Inadvertently committing credentials to a shared repository can have serious consequences, yet it is a simple mistake to make. Once an attacker gets your password or API key, they can take over your account, lock you out, and fraudulently spend money. This can even lead to a domino effect where access to one account grants access to others. With the stakes so high, it’s of paramount importance to learn as quickly as possible if secrets have been leaked.

**Svelte Native • The Svelte Mobile Development Experience**  
https://svelte-native.technology/  
Svelte Native is a new approach to building mobile applications using NativeScript. Where other JS-Native frameworks like React-Native and Nativescript-Vue do the bulk of their work on the mobile device, Svelte Native shifts that work into a compile step that happens when you build your app. Instead of using techniques like virtual DOM diffing, Svelte writes code that surgically updates the native view widgets when the state of your app changes.

**New Web Order: An Overview of Content-First Design**  
https://www.toptal.com/designers/company-website-design/content-first-design  
Designers do not simply decorate, they create an experience of moving through content. But what happens if a client or team members don’t understand how content should drive design? To avoid an upside-down process, there are strategies that can help explain the importance of content and rally a team around creating it upfront.

**The Principles of Design and Their Importance**  
https://uxplanet.org/the-principles-of-design-and-their-importance-77f959d0d555  
In reality, there are roughly a dozen basic principles of design that beginning and expert designers alike should keep in mind when working on their projects. In addition, there are another dozen or so “secondary” design principles that are sometimes included as basics (for example, the Gestalt Principles, typography, color, and framing). The main design principles are explained and illustrated below.

实际上商业模式不是盈利模式，它至少包含了四个方面：产品模式、用户模式、推广模式，最后才是盈利模式。商业模式是你能提供一个什么样的产品，给什么样的用户创造什么样的价值，在创造用户价值的过程中，用什么样的方法获得商业价值。一个企业的商业模式往往是复合式的，不能因为没有盈利模式而放弃业务，更不能为了追逐利益而忽略产品。
