**V8 release v7.8**  
https://v8.dev/blog/v8-release-78  
V8 v7.8 is filled with all sorts of developer-facing goodies. This post provides a preview of some of the highlights in anticipation of the release: JavaScript performance (size & speed), Faster object destructuring, Lazy source positions, Faster RegExp match failures. 另附：[V8 adds support for top-level await](https://chromium.googlesource.com/v8/v8.git/+/0ceee9ad28c21bc4971fb237cf87eb742fc787b8%5E%21/).  

**Into the web multiverse**  
https://christianheilmann.com/2019/09/25/into-the-web-multiverse/  
It was exciting and humbling to take a step back and look at the web from a user angle for a change. I hope that you got some inspiration from it what to do next. We have a chance to make it easier for everyone to create quality products for all end users. We have open source platforms with open communication channels that power the web. We accumulated a lot of knowledge, why not add it to our tools to teach the creators of the web in context?

**Exploring Collaboration and Communication with Mozilla Hubs**  
https://hacks.mozilla.org/2019/09/exploring-collaboration-and-communication-with-mozilla-hubs/  
Mozilla introduced Hubs, an immersive social experience that brings users together in shared 3D spaces. Hubs runs in the browser on mobile, desktop, and virtual reality devices. Since its initial release, the platform has undergone extensive development work to better enable communities and creators to embrace the opportunities that online collaborative environments have to offer. As a result, we’ve seen increased adoption of Hubs and new use cases have emerged.

**Why JavaScript Tooling Sucks**  
https://www.swyx.io/writing/js-tooling/  
JavaScript tooling is just too hard to use, and it’s not your fault,” says Shawn. JavaScript’s history, ownership, and target use cases have all had a role to play.

**[译]深度解读当代前端架构进化史，下一个趋势在哪**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzUxMzcxMzE5Ng==&mid=2247492611&idx=1&sn=1cb8a1e8815bbc25710fef4a0959680f  
早期的软件架构模式建立在有限的硬件功能上并尊重这一事实，然而，今天的情况已经变了。计算能力在不断提升，而软件架构印证了这种观点。本文从经典MVC说起，详尽解读了当代前端架构及下一阶段的展望。对于前端工程师，以及想从宏观层面理解现代Web应用程序架构的Web开发人员来说，均能从中获益。

**中台的末路**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MjM5MDUwNTQwMQ==&mid=2257483984&idx=1&sn=2c85903a6d18eddc8a35d4f573a8d6a9  
从 15 年开始，到 19 年现在为止。各大公司都在吹捧中台理念。仿佛中台是业务复杂性的救世主。是某些架构师和 PM 的新出路。各种割韭菜的讲中台的课程层出不穷。当然，吹牛逼的时候大家都是拣好的说，苦逼的东西就只有内部人士知道。中台到底靠谱还是不靠谱，只凭各路英雄的演讲内容，那看起来是靠谱的。先来看看这些公开的观点，再以我（码农桃花源注：资深研发工程师）的视角还原“中台”的真相。

**资深技术Leader曹乐：如何成为技术大牛**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzIyODE0Nzk3Mw==&mid=2247485127&idx=1&sn=3a6ee41b4f3214fb72c3ddceee955584  
在工作所在的技术和业务领域中刻意练习，加上行动中思考，就是成为技术大牛的秘诀。看起来方法也不复杂，为什么大牛还是非常稀少？尽管我们通篇都在讲方法，但其实在成为技术大牛的路上，方法反而是没那么重要的。真正困难的，在于数年，数十年如一日的坚持。太多人遇到挫折，遇到瓶颈，就觉得手头的事情太乏味枯燥，就想要换一个方向，换一个领域，去学新的技术，新的东西。而真正能够成为大牛的，必须是能够青灯古佛，熬得住突破瓶颈前长时间的寂寞的，必须是肯下笨功夫的聪明人。因此，和坚持相比，方法其实并没有那么重要。

**React Router v5.1**  
https://reacttraining.com/blog/react-router-v5-1/  
We are hard at work incorporating the best ideas from @reach/router, as well as community feedback about the 4/5 API, into version 6 which we expect will be ready sometime around the beginning of the new year. That being said, we are putting a lot of emphasis on making a silky smooth migration path for anyone who wants to stay up to date as we get closer to v6. As we introduce new features and APIs, we will let you know at every step of the way what you can do to make the transition as easy as possible.

**The Making of a 13 Kilobyte JS Real-Time Strategy Game**  
https://phoboslab.org/log/2019/09/voidcall-making-of

We’re also releasing a large dataset to help data scientists build models for this task, as well as several baseline models showing the current state of the art. Our leaderboard uses an annotated dataset of queries to evaluate the quality of code search tools.

**Five Machine Learning Applications for the Back Office**  
https://blog.algorithmia.com/five-machine-learning-applications-for-the-back-office  
A current trend among mid and large organizations is to implement Robotic Process Automation (RPA) in the back office to minimize manual tasks and achieve efficiencies. While there are specific use cases that make RPA an appropriate technology, there are significant differences with a machine learning approach. 另附：[In an era of distractions, Microsoft wants AI to be your coworker](https://www.fastcompany.com/90401814/microsoft-is-designing-ai-powered-next-gen-tools-for-the-age-of-distraction).

**Go Proposal Process: Enabling Experiments**  
https://research.swtch.com/proposals-experiment  
I’ve been thinking a lot recently about the Go proposal process, which is the way we propose, discuss, and decide changes to Go itself. Like nearly everything about Go, the proposal process is an experiment, so it makes sense to reflect on what we’ve learned and try to improve it. This post is the fifth in a series of posts about what works well and, more importantly, what we might want to change.

**OGL - Minimal WebGL framework**  
https://github.com/oframe/ogl  
OGL is a small, effective WebGL framework aimed at developers who like minimal layers of abstraction, and are comfortable creating their own shaders. With zero dependencies, the API shares many similarities with ThreeJS, however it is tightly coupled with WebGL and comes with much fewer features. In its design, the framework does the minimum abstraction necessary, so devs should still feel comfortable using it in conjunction with native WebGL commands. Keeping the level of abstraction low helps to make the framework easier to understand and extend, and also makes it more practical as a WebGL learning resource. 另附：[GPU.js - GPU Accelerated JavaScript](https://gpu.rocks/)

**10 Things to Know about the Microsoft NSAT Score**  
https://measuringu.com/microsoft-nsat/  
One we recently encountered is the Microsoft NSAT score. There isn’t much written about the NSAT that I could find, but I did find a document from Microsoft IT [.doc] that provides some guidance and a few articles describing its usage in case your organization is considering it (or you’ve heard about it). Here are ten things to know about this measurement of satisfaction. 另附：[The Future of UX Research](https://medium.com/microsoft-design/the-future-of-ux-research-14fe63743c1d).

**A Retrospective of AI + Music**  
https://blog.prototypr.io/a-retrospective-of-ai-music-95bfa9b38531  
The invention of electronic musical equipment in the mid-20th century revolutionized classical and popular music, and accelerated the development of new forms of music. As AI becomes more capable nowadays, machines play an increasingly important role in not only editing sounds, but also composing music. How has AI influenced music creation and music industry? Will AI take over musicians’ jobs?

**Breaking Down the Principles of Design (with Infographic)**  
https://www.toptal.com/designers/gui/principles-of-design-infographic  
While there’s plenty of debate over how many principles of design are out there (and even what they are), there are 12 that appear regularly on the list of principles. These 12 principles, explained in the infographic below, include contrast, balance, emphasis, proportion, hierarchy, repetition, rhythm, pattern, white space, movement, variety, and unity (there are also some additional Gestalt principles of design).

**Dear Startup: You have no idea how much that costs**  
http://kyleprifogle.com/dear-startup/  
Throughout my career working for tech startups I noticed a strange phenomenon. Throughout the beginning of my career I had a fair bit of what some would consider relatively “simple” web development work. Things like developing crud apps, building an API integration, etc. I noticed that even though I would give estimates for my work, my managers and their managers all the way up to the founder would have certain expectations about how long work should take regardless of my estimates, and if my estimates outpaced their expectations then there would be problems. Often times this would be in spite of the fact that many times those above me didn’t have nearly the technical expertise at all to make such an assessment. I chalked it off at the time as simply just a display of systemic mistrust within that organization and tried my best to meet their expectations in spite of them sometimes being unrealistic.

**在能力圈内行动，在舒适圈外学习**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/E0YL2-iM3U6oh08e3rTpKg  
“舒适圈”和“能力圈”看起来差不多，指你为自己划的一个圈，里面都是最熟悉的领域、知识、方法、习惯、心态……但是，这个两个理论却是完全相反的。“舒适圈”理论认为，舒适区里有安全感，但缺乏挑战，只有走出去，你才能进步；而“能力圈”投资理论却认为，每个人应该专注自己的知识边界，围绕你最熟悉的领域投资，不要觉得自己无所不能。当你看到一对矛盾的理论时，不要急着骂娘，不要轻易否定任何一方。你应该感到高兴，这是一个绝佳的机会，可以让你从更高的层次，同时理解这两个理论。

**张一鸣公开核心秘笈，推出「灵驹」搏击To B野心**
