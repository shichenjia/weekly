We have lost our patience after p69. Any doc or rtf philez sent as
submission will be immediately dropped on pastebin, text only please and
for vim users (:set textwidth=75).

As you probably know, the release time of your submissions does not depend
on other submissions. In other words: if you want a fast release of your
tech paper, we can totally include it in the paper feed (if it's good
enough, haha).

Since the introduction of the paper feed feature, your submission has four
possible outcomes:

    1. The article is accepted, it can be published in the paper feed if 
       you want. Congratz.

    2. The article is accepted, but will be published in the final release.
       If you decide to contribute to PWN or linenoise (lul), this will be
       the case. Nice one.

    3. The article is not *yet* suitable for PHRACK but nonetheless would
       be with additional work. A Phrack Staff reviewer is assigned to help
       you to improve your paper. After improving it, it will be included 
       in the paper feed or in the final magazine.

    4. The article is rejected. Please "back your article" and submit to
       Hakin9 ;>

You will be notified via email of to the outcome of your submission
shortly after the close of this CFP. Exceptionally good submissions may
still be accepted _after_ the end of the CFP.
