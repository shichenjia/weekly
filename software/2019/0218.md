**Rendering on the Web**  
https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2019/02/rendering-on-the-web  
As developers, we are often faced with decisions that will affect the entire architecture of our applications. One of the core decisions web developers must make is where to implement logic and rendering in their application. This can be a difficult, since there are a number of different ways to build a website. Our understanding of this space is informed by our work in Chrome talking to large sites over the past few years. Broadly speaking, we would encourage developers to consider server rendering or static rendering over a full rehydration approach. 另附：[Replacing a hot path in your app's JavaScript with WebAssembly](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2019/02/hotpath-with-wasm).

**This.JavaScript - State of Frameworks & Libraries**  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFF9eOlTWzY  
This.JavaScript is an online event for developers to hear the latest news in JavaScript. In this event, the State of Frameworks and Libraries, we will cover Node.js, Polymer.js, Ember.js, Preact, React.js, RxJS, Angular, and Vue.js. 另附：[How to Take JavaScript Beyond the Web in 2019](https://www.sitepoint.com/how-to-take-javascript-beyond-the-web-in-2019/).

**What’s next for SemVer**  
https://words.steveklabnik.com/what-s-next-for-semver  
Over the last few months, several of us2 have been talking, and today, we have an announcement to make. We’ve formed a semver team, and we intend to start work on producing a new version of the spec. Who is “we”? The team roster will be in a [GitHub team](https://words.steveklabnik.com/what-s-next-for-semver).

**The security risks of changing package owners**  
https://blog.npmjs.org/post/182828408610/the-security-risks-of-changing-package-owners  
We’ve had a few situations recently which illustrate that people are a layer beneath the code and the actions of maintainers have a direct impact on the security of the ecosystem. Specifically event-stream and koa-router. 

**None of my projects want to be SPAs**  
https://whatisjasongoldstein.com/writing/help-none-of-my-projects-want-to-be-spas/  
Back in the early days of SPAs, some people argued that it would be faster to only pass the data you need as JSON than to render whole pages. Nearly a decade later, this is almost never true. I can think of a few things that would benefit from being SPAs. A chat application is a no-brainer. A dashboard of realtime data might not need to be a SPA, but would benefit from a reactive component that updates when the API is polled. Maybe a complicated tool like Trello, a Calendar or a Nonlinear Video Editor could make sense, but even those have distinct screens, so a large reactive component on a particular screen may be a better fit. What’s more interesting is how many apps I’m seeing built as an SPA that really don’t need to be. Why does a website that orders food from restaurants need a Megabyte of javascript?

**我是如何传播自由软件理念的**  
https://tonghuix.io/how-i-promote-free-software/  
自从2017年不再担任北京GNU/Linux用户组的活动负责人以后，很多和自由软件推广相关的事情我也淡化了一些。不过为了让更多人投入到自由软件的推广和传播事业中来，我很愿意把之前推广和传播自由软件理念时候的一些心得体会总结下来，为有志于自由软件传播事业的同仁提供一些浅薄的经验。另附：[和 PingCAP CTO 黄东旭聊开源数据库新蓝海](https://www.geekpark.net/news/238087)、[半数以上国产手游曾使用他开源的引擎：Cocos和王哲的故事](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MjM5MDE0Mjc4MA==&mid=2651013427&idx=1&sn=642ebe900fa39fe2a314a32c5752e416).

**[译]前端技术选型的遗憾和经验教训**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MjM5MDE0Mjc4MA==&mid=2651013499&idx=2&sn=0c01339b2d187a377d5a57013627151a  
我是 Max，Spectrum 的技术联合创始人。Spectrum 是一个面向大型在线社区的开源聊天应用程序，最近被 GitHub 收购。我们是一个三人团队，主要拥有前端和设计背景，我们在这个项目上工作了近两年时间。事后看来，以下是我做出的令自己感到遗憾的技术选型以及从中学到的经验教训。

**IT架构的本质--我的五点感悟**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzU5NDAzNDEyMA==&mid=2247484105&idx=1&sn=4daeff5b2fd2964ce24fd70b54433a77  
参禅的三重境界在IT技术圈同样适用，初学者感叹每个产品都如此精妙绝伦，追逐着最强的IDE；老司机喜欢自比管乐指点江山，嘲讽着最好的语言；当一切回归平淡，搞IT就是一份思想延伸和语言翻译工作；其中技术架构师就是一份古朴甚至无趣的工作。我将架构师的工作总结出五条核心道理，这五条经验简单直白又深奥通透，算是对我十二年IT工作的一个总结。

**Getting Out of (Technical) Debt**  
https://www.sitepen.com/blog/getting-out-of-technical-debt/  
Technical debt may be a natural side effect of every development process, but it does not have to suffocate the team or degrade the user experience. By introducing thorough automated processes and conventions, taking the time to address existing debt, and appointing reliable leads, even teams with limited experience can settle their technical debt and produce healthy, successful applications.

**Animation in React**  
https://www.nearform.com/blog/animation-in-react/

**Developing fast & reliable iOS builds at Pinterest (Part one)**  
https://medium.com/@Pinterest_Engineering/developing-fast-reliable-ios-builds-at-pinterest-part-one-cb1810407b92  
At Pinterest we’re focused on helping people discover inspiring ideas, from dinner recipes to try, home and style products to buy, to places to travel. Building the best products for mobile is a critical part of that, with 80% of all Pinners access Pinterest via mobile apps. On the iOS team specifically, we’re constantly working to improve that experience as efficiently and quickly as we can, and giving our team the best development and testing environment is a key step in that.

**Anyone can create a virtual reality experience with this new WebVR starter kit from Mozilla and Glitch**  
https://hacks.mozilla.org/2019/02/webvr-starter-kit-mozilla-glitch/  
Building a virtual reality experience may seem daunting, but it really isn’t. WebVR and frameworks like A-Frame make it really easy to get started. This is why we worked with Glitch to create a WebVR starter kit. It is a free, 5-part video course with interactive code examples that will teach you the fundamentals of WebVR using A-Frame. Our hope is that this starter kit will encourage anyone who has been on the fence about creating virtual reality experiences to dive in and get started.

**New UI tools and a richer creative canvas come to ARCore**  
https://developers.googleblog.com/2019/02/new-ui-tools-and-richer-creative-canvas.html  
ARCore and Sceneform give developers simple yet powerful tools for creating augmented reality (AR) experiences. In our last update (version 1.6) we focused on making virtual objects appear more realistic within a scene. In version 1.7, we're focusing on creative elements like AR selfies and animation as well as helping you improve the core user experience in your apps.

**Distributed web not ready for Runet cutoff from the Internet**  
https://www.ctrl.blog/entry/dweb-readiness-runet#  
We’re still in the early days of the distributed web. The planned interruption of access to the global internet in Russia serves as an important reminder that our networks are incredibly interconnected, and that distributed networks need to do more to live up to their potential. 另附：[Well-Known URI vs DNS-SD for routing distributed web service discovery around internet censorship](https://www.ctrl.blog/entry/wellknown-vs-dnssd-for-dweb#).

**Cloud Programming Simplified: A Berkeley View on Serverless Computing**  
https://rise.cs.berkeley.edu/blog/a-berkeley-view-on-serverless-computing/  
[Cloud Programming Simplified: A Berkeley View on Serverless Computing](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/2019/EECS-2019-3.html) with some of the same authors commemorates the tenth anniversary of that landmark paper.   Serverless Computing provides an interface that greatly simplifies cloud programming, and represents an evolution that closely parallels past advances in programmer productivity, such as the transition from assembly language to high-level programming languages. Although it is arguably an oxymoron—you are still using servers to compute—the name caught on because it suggests that the cloud user simply writes the code and delegates the considerable server system administration tasks required by conventional cloud computing to the cloud provider.

**Cloud Native Application Architecture**  
https://medium.com/walmartlabs/cloud-native-application-architecture-a84ddf378f82  
Cloud native is an approach for building applications as micro-services and running them on a containerised and dynamically orchestrated platforms that fully exploits the advantages of the cloud computing model. Cloud-native is about how applications are created and deployed, not where. Such technologies empower organisations to build and run scalable applications in modern, dynamic environments such as public, private, and hybrid clouds.

**Introducing PlaNet: A Deep Planning Network for Reinforcement Learning**  
https://ai.googleblog.com/2019/02/introducing-planet-deep-planning.html  
To spur progress on this research challenge and in collaboration with DeepMind, we present the Deep Planning Network (PlaNet) agent, which learns a world model from image inputs only and successfully leverages it for planning. PlaNet solves a variety of image-based control tasks, competing with advanced model-free agents in terms of final performance while being 5000% more data efficient on average. We are additionally releasing the source code for the research community to build upon.

**Introducing Ludwig, a Code-Free Deep Learning Toolbox**  
https://eng.uber.com/introducing-ludwig/

By using Ludwig, experts and researchers can simplify the prototyping process and streamline data processing so that they can focus on developing deep learning architectures rather than data wrangling.

**Audio AI: isolating vocals from stereo music using Convolutional Neural Networks**  
https://towardsdatascience.com/audio-ai-isolating-vocals-from-stereo-music-using-convolutional-neural-networks-210532383785  
Formally known as Audio Source Separation, the problem we are trying to solve here consists in recovering or reconstructing one or more source signals that, through some -linear or convolutive- process, have been mixed with other signals. The field has many practical applications including but not limited to speech denoising and enhancement, music remixing, spatial audio, remastering, etc. In the context of music production, it is sometimes referred to as unmixing or demixing. There’s a good amount of resources on the subject, going from ICA-based -blind- Source Separation, to semi-supervised Non-negative Matrix Factorization techniques, to more recent neural network-based approaches. For a nice walkthrough on the first two, you can check out these tutorial mini-series from CCRMA, which I found very useful back in the day.

**Better Language Models and Their Implications**  
https://blog.openai.com/better-language-models/  
We’ve trained a large-scale unsupervised language model which generates coherent paragraphs of text, achieves state-of-the-art performance on many language modeling benchmarks, and performs rudimentary reading comprehension, machine translation, question answering, and summarization — all without task-specific training.

**This is Microsoft’s AI pipeline, from research to reality**  
https://www.fastcompany.com/90305091/this-is-microsofts-ai-pipeline-from-research-to-reality  
It’s not enough to have brilliant researchers and a bunch of popular products. You’ve got to have a system–or several systems–for melding raw technology into experiences that make a difference for businesses and consumers.

Every dynamic language has these people who resist the static typing that inevitably some people try to bring to the language.

**On Being A Principal Engineer**  
https://blog.dbsmasher.com/2019/01/28/on-being-a-principal-engineer.html  
T bought and read [The Manager’s Path](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1491973897/) by the awesome Camille Fournier when it first came out. The title of the book and its stated goal might be laying out the path in engineering management up to senior leadership, but reading it made it clear to me that the book is also of great value to individual contributors to help explain what all these titles mean, what each layer of management is supposed to focus on, and how engineering concerns converge ultimately with business concerns and crystallize into a strategy for a technical organization. I also realized that while I am still an individual contributor, the principal engineer role carries enough cross-organization work, and enough people skills, that it is much closer to management than it may seem without engineers reporting directly to me. 另附：[How to be mindful at work](https://cheesecakelabs.com/blog/how-to-be-mindful-at-work/)、[7 Reliability Questions Engineering Managers Need to Ask Their Teams](https://thenewstack.io/7-reliability-questions-engineering-managers-need-to-ask-their-teams/).

二十五年前，我们读到的一篇文章中提到，贫困国家每年有数十万儿童死于腹泻。这个出乎我们意料的数字，促使我们确立了盖茨基金会的理念。我们相信，在一个人人平等的世界中，所有人都应从创新中受益，没有任何一个孩子会死于可预防的疾病。但我们看到的是，不平等依然大量存在。这个发现是我们的慈善之路上的重要一步。震惊之余，我们心生愤慨，并决心为此采取行动。当然，也有令人惊喜的意外。刚开始了解疟疾的时候，我们以为只有发明长效疫苗才能切实推进抗疟事业。孰不知，得益于推广使用蚊帐和其他多种手段，疟疾导致的死亡人数自2000年以来已经下降了42%。在今年的公开信里，我们希望和大家分享一路走来的另外九大意外。有些让人忧虑，有些给人启迪，但无一不激励我们采取行动。我们希望大家也能获得同样的鼓舞，并付诸行动。只有这样，世界才能变得更好。
