## 深阅读

**Responsible JavaScript: Part I**  
https://alistapart.com/article/responsible-javascript-part-1  
By the numbers, JavaScript is a performance liability. If the trend persists, the median page will be shipping at least 400 KB of it before too long, and that’s merely what’s transferred. Like other text-based resources, JavaScript is almost always served compressed—but that might be the only thing we’re getting consistently right in its delivery.

**Blazingly fast parsing, part 1: optimizing the scanner**  
https://v8.dev/blog/scanner  
To run a JavaScript program, the source text needs to be processed so V8 can understand it. V8 starts out by parsing the source into an abstract syntax tree (AST), a set of objects that represent the program structure. That AST gets compiled to bytecode by Ignition. The performance of these parse + compile phases is important: V8 cannot run code before compilation is done. In this series of blog posts, we focus on parsing, and the work done in V8 to ship a blazingly fast parser.

**A Future Without Webpack**  
https://www.pikapkg.com/blog/pika-web-a-future-without-webpack  
How [@pika/web](https://github.com/pikapkg/web) installs npm packages that run natively in the browser, for a faster and less complex web app.

**The Future of Cross-Platform is Native**  
https://hackernoon.com/the-future-of-cross-platform-is-native-13cc66bf1c00  
This is the 2nd post in a 2 post series. [Post 1: “Cross-Platform? We Don’t Say That Around Here Anymore”](https://hackernoon.com/cross-platform-we-dont-say-that-around-here-anymore-cd269fcd4a5b). 另附：[NativeScript 5.3](https://www.nativescript.org/blog/nativescript-5.3-hot-module-replacement-officially-supported-and-more).

**百度App网络深度优化：DNS 和连接优化**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzUxMzcxMzE5Ng==&mid=2247490822&idx=1&sn=8610ca7454655d59d948afb952003750  
网络优化是客户端几大技术方向中公认的一个深度领域，百度 App 也不例外，今天，我们在这里向大家介绍百度 App 网络深度优化的实践经验，内容主要包括 DNS 优化和连接优化，希望对大家在网络方向的学习和实践有所帮助。另附：[腾讯对抗腾讯](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/7BMQyQhalZqg_koQDMVFnw)、[阿里巴巴重磅发布120页PPT，深度诠释国家“智能+”战略](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MjM5ODQ1NjE2Nw==&mid=2652441584&idx=2&sn=f0387a456fc5c30bbdc0ebc9a7a5ea28)。

**腾讯 - 产业互联网 ——构建智能+时代数字生态新图景**  
http://tisi.org/5072  
随着云计算等企业级技术应用的发展普及，产业互联网实际已经在各行各业展开实践。广度上不仅覆盖服务业、工业和农业，还从商业扩展到公益和政府，整个社会走向全面互联；深度上从营销服务、生产研发到运营管理，互联渗透到组织内部的各个环节。数据信息由此实现从消费端到供给端的高效流通，数字产业与传统产业相互协同带动，推助中国经济迈向高质量发展新阶段。

**中国互联网公司开源项目调查报告**

近年来，开源技术得到越来越多的重视，微软收购 GitHub、IBM 收购红帽，都表明了开源的价值。国内公司也越来越多的参与开源，加入开源基金会 / 贡献开源项目。但是，它们到底做得如何呢？为此 InfoQ 统计了国内在 GitHub 上较活跃的 7 家一线互联网公司的 50 多个账号的 2800 多个项目，为大家呈现一部分答案。

**计算广告系统算法与架构综述**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MjM5ODkzMzMwMQ==&mid=2650409451&idx=1&sn=38c225b5d084558a09240ba2cffd0570  
我们当今身处一个被广告包围的时代，无论是走在马路上、收看电视剧、或者是玩手机游戏，都能看见形形色色的广告。作为IT从业者，自然想对广告产业背后的产品、技术一探究竟，正如刘鹏博士在其《计算广告》一书中所说的“不论你在做一款用户产品还是商业产品，不深入了解在线 广告，就不太可能全面地了解互联网业务”，因此本文也希望能带领读者从产品、技术以及整个生态的角度深入浅出的了解计算广告。

**配置化页面渲染系统设计和实践**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/nwC7-ATCCUBS11Gb7FtbgA  
随着大数据、监控系统、分析系统等概念逐渐在各大小公司中普及后，开发一个前端系统以展示和控制的需求则变得十分常见，所以我们也不例外。在开始着手开发之前，事实上我们已经考察甚至长时间使用过一些不同类型的类似系统，如监控报表系统 Grafana、数据分析系统 Zeppline、Metabase、Superset 等等。我们不难发现这些的设计思路都有一个共同的特点：卡片式页面结构。

**Building Spotify’s New Web Player**  
https://labs.spotify.com/2019/03/25/building-spotifys-new-web-player/

**CSS Houdini Could Change the Way We Write and Manage CSS**  
https://css-tricks.com/css-houdini-could-change-the-way-we-write-and-manage-css/  
One way I’ve been able to do that is to use it as a way to avoid reinventing the wheel. We’ll go over that in this post while comparing it with methods we currently use in JavaScript and CSS.

**how YOU visualized it**  
http://www.storytellingwithdata.com/blog/2019/3/25/how-you-visualized-this

This article presents a qualitative visualization method for comparing recurrent units with regards to memorization and contextual understanding. The method is applied to the three recurrent units mentioned above: Nested LSTMs, LSTMs, and GRUs.

**Was MongoDB Ever the Right Choice?**  
https://www.simplethread.com/was-mongodb-ever-the-right-choice/  
MongoDB has become a much more mature product. So what happened? Did all of the hate truly come from mistakes made in the early implementation/marketing of MongoDB? Or is the problem that people are blaming MongoDB for their own lack of efforts when evaluating if it was a good fit?

**How Heroku Expects the Unexpectable**  
https://blog.heroku.com/bug-bounties-black-swans  
There’s obviously more to security than humans, technology, and vendors with all of their implementations and expertise. At Heroku we believe that security is a byproduct of excellence in engineering. All too often, software is written solely with the happy path in mind, and security assurances of that software has it’s own dangerous assumptions. A mature security program should challenge assumptions of security controls, move to testing continuous, and prepare for the unexpectable.

**Building and Scaling Data Lineage at Netflix to Improve Data Infrastructure Reliability, and Efficiency**

https://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-word2vec/  
In this post, we’ll go over the concept of embedding, and the mechanics of generating embeddings with word2vec. But let’s start with an example to get familiar with using vectors to represent things. Did you know that a list of five numbers (a vector) can represent so much about your personality?

It is capable of normalizing natural language search queries, auto-completing a search query and providing the most relevant results for a query. Sonic is an identifier index, rather than a document index; when queried, it returns IDs that can then be used to refer to the matched documents in an external database.

每个公司的愿景和使命都很重要，在我眼里最重要的还是公司的价值观和文化。很多人认为文化是非常虚的东西，没有什么必要，但我认为这完全是错的。公司的愿景和使命会一直变化，但是公司的文化和价值观从成立的第一天就要定下来一直不变，要天天讲、月月讲，重复强调、一直秉承下去。
