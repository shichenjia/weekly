**Faster and more feature-rich internationalization APIs**  
https://v8.dev/blog/intl  
ECMA-402, or Intl provides key locale-specific functionality such as date formatting, number formatting, plural form selection, and collation. The Chrome V8 and Google Internationalization teams have been collaborating on adding features to V8’s ECMA-402 implementation, while cleaning up technical debt and improving performance and interoperability with other browsers. 另附：[A year with Spectre: a V8 perspective](https://v8.dev/blog/spectre)

**Introducing Node.js 12**  
https://medium.com/@nodejs/introducing-node-js-12-76c41a1b3f3f  
Highlighted updates and features include faster startup and better default heap limits, updates to V8, TLS, llhttp, new features including diagnostic report, bundled heap dump capability and updates to Worker Threads, N-API and ES6 module support and more. 另附：[Node 12's New Experimental ES Modules Support(https://medium.com/@nodejs/announcing-a-new-experimental-modules-1be8d2d6c2ff).

**Svelte 3: Rethinking reactivity**  
https://svelte.dev/blog/svelte-3-rethinking-reactivity  
[Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) is a component framework — like React or Vue — but with an important difference. Traditional frameworks allow you to write declarative state-driven code, but there's a penalty: the browser must do extra work to convert those declarative structures into DOM operations, using techniques like  that eat into your frame budget and tax the garbage collector. Instead, Svelte runs at build time, converting your components into highly efficient imperative code that surgically updates the DOM. As a result, you're able to write ambitious applications with excellent performance characteristics.

**Application State Management with React**  
https://kentcdodds.com/blog/application-state-management-with-react  
Here's the real kicker, if you're building an application with React, you already have a state management library installed in your application. You don't even need to npm install (or yarn add) it. It costs no extra bytes for your users, it integrates with all React packages on npm, and it's already well documented by the React team. It's React itself. React is a state management library.

**从前端角度看企业软件的研发过程**  
https://www.yuque.com/xufei-coder/code/fd0gv5  
一直以来，企业软件前端工程体系处于一个很尴尬的局面，无数前端对它有过各种吐槽：技术栈老旧、封闭，体验差，而项目和交付经理又会觉得开发效率太低。据我所见，大部分吐槽的人并没有理解造成这些状况的深层原因，或者说，当自己去构建这么一套体系的时候，并不理解在选型和技术集成过程中，存有哪些可能的决策点。本文尝试从一些角度去给出自己的见解，为了说明构建这个领域前端技术体系的种种考虑，同时也会述及对应的业务特性。

**百度应用层智能网络演进**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzUyMzA3MTY1NA==&mid=2247484929&idx=1&sn=3d6b26e04486fd10240b5908998627c8  
在爆发式增长的情况下，网络接入必须能快速响应各种层面需求，保证用户访问体验流畅。简单来说，在网络接入要做到访问加速、接入高可用、安全防攻击等。而在移动时代的下一幕人工智能时代，万物互联，语音交互……更需要在网络接入时有针对性优化的解决方案。谁拥有快速、稳定、安全网络接入技术，谁才有能力应对起业务增长与服务用户的挑战。云端网络统一接入、网络流量智能调度、终端网络优化组件，是支撑移动与智能时代的网络接入核心技术。另附：[百度智能交通技术派 - 不止于2D，酷炫的地图3D热力图实现解析](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzI5NDQ2Nzk3Ng==&mid=2247485057&idx=1&sn=90a39ee5674347ea5d98aceb030a072d)。

**展望 React 17，回顾 React 往事**  
https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/40160380  
要讨论未来（React 17），必须要了解过去。以 React 16 为分水岭，我们可以分为两方面来看这个问题。一是为什么，二是怎么办。

**Understanding WebViews**  
https://www.kirupa.com/apps/webview.htm  
When it comes to accessing internet content, we typically use a browser like Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Internet Explorer, and Edge. You are probably using one of those browsers right now to read this article! While browsers are pretty popular for the whole task of accessing internet content, they have some serious competition that we probably never paid much attention to. This competition comes in the form of something known as a WebView. This article will explain all about what this mysterious WebView is and why it is sorta kinda cool.

**JavaScript minification**  
http://neugierig.org/software/blog/2019/04/js-minifiers.html  
JavaScript applications are written as a collection of .js files that are usually transformed before being served in a browser. One reason to transform is to improve page load time. There are two primary components to improving page load time: bundling multiple files together, and minifying to make the bundle size smaller. This post walks through why we do these and what the implications are for doing such a thing, and concludes with a few projects I've been working on to improve this space (spoiler: comparitive benchmarks).

**Introducing CLI Builders**  
https://blog.angular.io/introducing-cli-builders-d012d4489f1b  
In this blog post, we’re going to look at a new API in Angular CLI, which allows you to add CLI features and augment existing ones. We’ll discuss how to interact with this API and what are the extension points which allow you to add additional features to the CLI.

**Comparing JVM alternatives to JavaScript**  
https://renato.athaydes.com/posts/comparing-jvm-alternatives-to-js.html  
I am mostly a backend developer, but every now and then I need to do some frontend work. Even if just for personal use. For that reason, I’ve been following developments in the JavaScript world from a distance, but I dislike much of what I see.

**Elixir, Phoenix, Absinthe, GraphQL, React, and Apollo: an absurdly deep dive**  
https://schneider.dev/blog/elixir-phoenix-absinthe-graphql-react-apollo-absurdly-deep-dive/  
If you’re anything like me, at least 3 or 4 of the keywords in the title of this article fall under the category of “things I’ve been wanting to play with but haven’t gotten around to it yet.” React is the exception; I use it almost every day at work and know it front and back. I used Elixir for a project a couple of years ago, but it’s been a while and I’ve never used it in the context of GraphQL. Similarly, I’ve done a small amount of work on a project that used GraphQL with a Node.js backend and Relay on the frontend, but I barely scratched the surface of GraphQL and I’ve never used Apollo. I firmly believe that the best way to truly learn a technology is to build something with it, so I decided to take a deep dive and build a web application with all of these technologies together. If you want to skip to the end, the code is on GitHub and there’s a live demo here.

**Using Clean Architecture for Microservice APIs in Node.js with MongoDB and Express**  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnailTcJV_U  
In this video we talk about Bob Martin's Clean Architecture model and I will show you how we can apply it to a Microservice built in node.js with MongoDB and Express JS.

**A Redesign of Google Earth Timelapse Encourages Users to Explore, and Stay for a While**  
https://medium.com/google-design/redesigning-google-earth-timelapse-135a963cc35  
Google Earth Timelapse is a great example of how Google can take a massive amount of data, democratize it, and enlighten us — in this case about the planet we live on. There’s nothing like a living, moving image to show us how the world has changed over decades, as the zoomable video in Timelapse allows us to do for places like the Columbia Glacier or the Tibetan Plateau. Today we’ve improved Timelapse so that the site can tell richer stories about the planet, and more people can share these stories. 

**Gradients in UI Design**  
https://blog.marvelapp.com/gradients-ui-design/  
If you open Dribbble or Behance right now, there is a strong chance you will see dozens of designs that use gradients. The gradients designers use are loud and full of color. In this article, I want to share some tips on how to use gradients in design.

**Sympathy vs. Empathy in UX**  
https://www.nngroup.com/articles/sympathy-vs-empathy-ux/  
As UX professionals, it is our job to advocate on behalf of our users. To do it, we must understand them. Understanding our users means building empathy for human beings who experience the product or service we create. In an effort to practice empathy, many teams mistakenly practice sympathy. Although these words have different meanings, teams often incorrectly use sympathy and empathy interchangeably. This confusion results in a large gap in their understanding and in an inability to address real human needs. The goal of this article is to help you reflect on your current UX practice — are you unknowingly practicing pity and sympathy instead of empathy?

**How to Create an Institution That Lasts 10,000 Years**  
https://www.edge.org/conversation/alexander_rose-how-to-create-an-institution-that-lasts-10000-years  
We’re also looking at the oldest living companies in the world, most of which are service-based. There are some family-run hotels and things like that, but also a huge amount in the food and beverage industry. Probably a third of the organizations or the companies over 500 or 1,000 years old are all in some way in wine, beer, or sake production. I was intrigued by that crossover.

“深井式”组织等级分明，上层负责战略决策，下层负责执行。公司中的绝大多数人都是执行者，对他们而言，只需要正确地做事就可以，而什么是正确的事则是极少数领导者，甚至是唯一领导者的责任。在小型组织中，由于层级较少，顶层设计者能够对一线状况准确把握，据此作出合理布局，“深井式”组织并不会导致太大的问题。一旦组织体量变大，公司层级不断叠加，决策者会自然而然远离“战场前线”，公司信息传递滞后，导致组织僵化，无法及时应对市场变化。尤其在面对当下错综复杂的环境时，这种反应迟钝常常使得昔日的市场霸主被后来者出其不意地颠覆。
