========  

## 深阅读

**Node v13.0.0 (Current)**  
https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v13.0.0/  
https://medium.com/@nodejs/node-js-12-to-lts-and-node-js-13-is-here-e28d6a4a2bd  
The V8 engine was updated to version 7.8. This includes performance improvements to object destructuring, memory usage and WebAssembly startup time. Node.js releases are now built with default full-icu support. This means that all locales supported by ICU are now included and Intl-related APIs may return different values than before. The minimum Xcode version supported for macOS was increased to 10. 另附：[10 Years of Node with Gireesh Punathil of IBM](https://www.nearform.com/blog/10-years-of-node-with-gireesh-punathil-of-ibm/).

**Preparing for the Future with React Prereleases**  
https://reactjs.org/blog/2019/10/22/react-release-channels.html  
To share upcoming changes with our partners in the React ecosystem, we’re establishing official prerelease channels. We hope this process will help us make changes to React with confidence, and give developers the opportunity to try out experimental features. This post will be most relevant to developers who work on frameworks, libraries, or developer tooling. Developers who use React primarily to build user-facing applications should not need to worry about our prerelease channels.

**Open-sourcing Polynote: an IDE-inspired polyglot notebook**  
https://medium.com/netflix-techblog/open-sourcing-polynote-an-ide-inspired-polyglot-notebook-7f929d3f447  
We are pleased to announce the open-source launch of Polynote: a new, polyglot notebook with first-class Scala support, Apache Spark integration, multi-language interoperability including Scala, Python, and SQL, as-you-type autocomplete, and more.

**What is Serverless? The “2020” edition**  
https://medium.com/swlh/what-is-serverless-the-2020-edition-5a2f21581fe5  
I’ve spent most of this year avoiding talking about serverless as can be seen from previous blog posts such as [Serverless is Doctrine, not a Technology](https://medium.com/@PaulDJohnston/serverless-is-a-doctrine-not-a-technology-4193ccb66cfc?_branch_match_id=565163401648862239) and [Cloud 2.0 is no longer King — Serverless has dethroned it](https://medium.com/@PaulDJohnston/cloud-2-0-code-is-no-longer-king-serverless-has-dethroned-it-c6dc955db9d5). Discussions on various networks have tended to descend into discussions around the compute aspects of FaaS. Not only that, but I’ve tried to stay out of discussions, because it feels like too many big companies and marketing budgets are trying to “own” the word, to ensure that their technology is part of the movement. The word “serverless” has definitely been co-opted by a range of companies to fit their preferred technology that in my mind it doesn’t fit. 另附：[Zoho Catalyst - The simplest serverless platform you’ll ever see](https://www.zoho.com/catalyst/).

**Rethink: Serverless For Frontend**  
https://www.yuque.com/egg/nodejs/sff-slide  
大概两个月前，为了给团队小伙伴分享我们目前做的事的价值，写了一篇 『Serverless For Frontend 前世今生』 。在那篇文章中，主要讲了进入每个阶段的缘由和产出的东西，但对演进背后的源动力的思考和阐述有所欠缺。在之后这段时间，一方面跟内外的同学交流，一方面在实践中去复盘，于是有了本分享。我希望讲清楚 Serverless For Frontend 的 Why 以及一部分目前看到的 What ，但不会讲太多 How ，因为都还在摸索中，且大家的基建都不一样，无从复制。本文，则主要是对分享的 Slide 的一些提炼，完整的 Slide 参见文末。另附：[2019 JSConf China 《面向传统，Serverless 进化之路》分享文字版](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/87940654).

**阿里开源十年激荡史**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/pJFt2ivGtP-vBpTFOGCbyw  
在圈内，开源一度被称为“集市”。相对封闭严格的传统企业 IT 文化，开源更强调自由开放的社区文化。InfoQ 追踪阿里巴巴多年，找到了阿里巴巴整个开源发展过程中的数位关键”赶集人“，试图了解这一中国近十年极具代表性的科技公司的开源历史。过去十年，阿里巴巴经历了淘宝的壮大，阿里云计算的成立，上市，双11节节攀升的流量，每一个阶段都有其存在的意义和目标，开源也随着这些变化而在不同的时期表现出不一样的状态。不变的是，阿里这群“赶集人”探索出了一条自主开源的道路，一走就是十个年头。另附：[解密国内BAT等大厂前端技术体系-百度篇](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzI5MjYyODYyNQ==&mid=2247483972&idx=1&sn=717de03ea3e9c95fecaac91f7f9e5795)。

**如何通过 DDD 降低软件开发的成本**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MjM5Mjg4NDMwMA==&mid=2652977080&idx=1&sn=19e47cf4391b0a0216c411bd69b57351  
DDD 是一个有效的方式，但是如果 DDD 的落地方式过于复杂，一定会催生出更简化的方式。即：复杂度同力一样不会消失，也不会凭空产生，它总是从一个物体转移到另一个物体或一种形式转为另一种形式。

**Server-X：一款可能提升你十倍工作效率的工具**  
https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/87684011  
本文将介绍一款全新的前端开发工具，希望它能给你的前端开发带来看起来和现在一样但其实又不那么一样的体验。如同它名字的前半部分，server，你可以简单地说，server-x（缩写为 svrx）就是一个本地服务器， 并且它还是一个功能丰富、使用便捷的轻量级服务器。

**The problems of shared mutable state and how to avoid them**  
https://2ality.com/2019/10/shared-mutable-state.html  
This blog post answers the following questions: What is shared mutable state? Why is it problematic? How can its problems be avoided? Sections marked with “(advanced)” go deeper and can be skipped if you want to read this blog post more quickly.

**Focusing on focus**  
https://blog.whatwg.org/focusing-on-focus  
Focus behavior in HTML had been under-specified for the past few years, and it was also quite confusing due to a variety of subtle differences between focusing methods, UA-specific behaviors, relation to the tabindex attribute, relations to shadow DOM, etc. A few months ago Domenic filed a meta-bug that contains a list of things to fix so that we would have a good foundation for further additions to focus-related stuff, and to hopefully make focus in HTML make sense to browser engineers and web authors!

**Writing Asynchronous Tasks In Modern JavaScript**  
https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2019/10/asynchronous-tasks-modern-javascript/  
In this article, we are going to explore the evolution of JavaScript around asynchronous execution in the past era and how it changed the way we write and read code. We will start with the beginnings of web development, and go all the way to modern asynchronous pattern examples.

**Gantry: Slack’s Fast-booting Frontend Framework**  
https://slack.engineering/gantry-slacks-fast-booting-frontend-framework-fb70c8eed2fd  
Gantry’s successful rollout internally came down to us taking a concept that was already working and abstracting it for general consumption. The intersection of multiple product requirements meant we covered most use-cases that a Slack application might need, and this has kept Gantry flexible enough to support many other applications since its inception.

**Task-based effectiveness of basic visualizations**  
https://blog.acolyer.org/2019/10/25/task-based-effectiveness-of-basic-visualizations/  
So far this week we’ve seen how to create all sorts of fantastic interactive visualisations, and taken a look at what data analysts actually do when they do ‘exploratory data analysis.’ To round off the week today’s choice is a recent paper on an age-old topic: what visualisation should I use? No prizes for guessing “it depends!” …the effectiveness of a visualization depends on several factors including task at the hand, and data attributes and datasets visualized. Is this the paper to finally settle the age-old debate surrounding pie-charts??

**The Dynamic Composer (an AWS serverless pattern)**  
https://www.jeremydaly.com/the-dynamic-composer-an-aws-serverless-pattern/  
I’m a big fan of following the Single Responsibility Principle when creating Lambda functions in my serverless applications. However, there are several drawbacks with this approach that often attract criticism. These include things like increased complexity, higher likelihood of cold starts, separation of log files, and the inability to easily compose functions. I think there is merit to these criticisms, but I have personally found the benefits to far outweigh any of the negatives. A little bit of googling should help you find ways to mitigate many of these concerns, but I want to focus on the one that seems to trip most people up: function composition.

**Storing 50 million events per second in Elasticsearch: How we did it**  
https://datadome.co/bot-protection-engineering/store-50-million-event-per-second-in-elasticsearch/  
Improving our monitoring has allowed us to better understand what is happening inside our cluster. For each index, no matter its size, we now have shards with no more than 25GB of data on each. Having smaller shards also enables better rebalancing and relocation when needed. We avoid hotspot issues because our hot layer only has shards in write, and the hot, warm and cold architecture improves our cache utilization for read requests.

**PyTorch Mobile: Exploring Facebook’s new mobile machine learning solution**  
https://heartbeat.fritz.ai/pytorch-mobile-exploring-facebooks-new-mobile-machine-learning-solution-96c99efbfd58  
PyTorch enters the mobile machine learning game with its experimental mobile deployment pipeline.

**GRIT: a Protocol for Distributed Transactions across Microservices**  
https://tech.ebayinc.com/engineering/grit-a-protocol-for-distributed-transactions-across-microservices/  
eBay technologists recently showed off a distributed transaction protocol called GRIT, for distributed ACID (atomicity, consistency, isolation, durability) transactions across microservices with multiple underlying databases.

**A new era of spatial computing brings fresh challenges—and solutions—to VR**  
https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/a-new-era-of-spatial-computing-brings-fresh-challenges-and-solutions-to-vr/  
Researchers will be showing off a method for allowing people to safely navigate a given route in real-world environments, such as a daily walk to work, while seeing themselves strolling a different VR world, such as a city of their choosing. They’ve also developed a technology that leverages newly introduced eye-tracking of users so that visual details in VR can be changed in real time without those changes being detected. Finally, researchers have invented a new haptic feedback controller that uniquely emulates the human sense of touch by meshing centuries-old and cutting-edge technologies.

**Lesser Known Coding Fonts**  
https://vfoley.xyz/lesser-known-coding-fonts/  
In this post, I want to show five fonts that I don’t see as often on /r/unixporn, but which I believe deserve to be better known. (Edit: ironically enough, this post cannot be posted on /r/unixporn, because they don’t accept content that isn’t screenshots, photos, or videos.)

**SSH PORT**  
https://www.ssh.com/ssh/port  
The default SSH port is 22. It is not a coincidence. This is a story of how it got that port.

**Why Devs (Should) Like Estimates**  
https://stackoverflow.blog/2019/10/23/why-devs-should-like-estimates/  
As a Principal Web Developer at Stack Overflow and a long time Tech Lead, I learnt that accurate estimates were essential in order for a company to be healthy and productive. Over the years I have spent a good deal of time developing my theories for why estimates and breakdowns are so important, and crafting my own methodology for how best to go about doing them. Below, I attempt to distill the lessons I’ve learned so that others can experiment with and improve upon my techniques. Now, I should be clear, the advice below is what works for me. I’m sure there are different approaches that might work better for others. Feel free to share your favorite approach in the comments.

**Open Doodles - Free sketchy illustrations**  
https://www.opendoodles.com/  
Open Doodles is a set of free illustrations that embraces the idea of Open Design. You can copy, edit, remix, share, or redraw these images for any purpose without restriction under copyright or database law (CC0 license.) I hope that this kind of resource makes it easier for designers to show the value of illustration in their mockups. Maybe you use these images as placeholders, before you're ready to hire an illustrator. Or perhaps this will encourage others to create their own kit and share it with the world.

**Change for the Good or Bad? A Guide to UX Innovation**  
https://www.toptal.com/designers/ux/ux-innovation  
UX innovation is a natural extension of that desire to create new things and make life easier. But while carefully thought-out innovations are often welcome, not all change is good. Innovation for innovation’s sake often leads to websites that aren’t user-friendly and do little more than feed the designer’s ego. So how does a UX designer decide when to innovate and when to follow established design patterns? Why do designers choose to implement innovative UX designs in the first place? And what should designers keep in mind when they’ve decided to try something original and creative on a project?
