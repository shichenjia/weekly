**How to Move Beyond a Monolithic Data Lake to a Distributed Data Mesh**  
https://martinfowler.com/articles/data-monolith-to-mesh.html  
Many enterprises are investing in their next generation data lake, with the hope of democratizing data at scale to provide business insights and ultimately make automated intelligent decisions. Data platforms based on the data lake architecture have common failure modes that lead to unfulfilled promises at scale. To address these failure modes we need to shift from the centralized paradigm of a lake, or its predecessor data warehouse. We need to shift to a paradigm that draws from modern distributed architecture: considering domains as the first class concern, applying platform thinking to create self-serve data infrastructure, and treating data as a product.

**Better HTTP/2 Prioritization for a Faster Web**  
https://blog.cloudflare.com/better-http-2-prioritization-for-a-faster-web/  
HTTP/2 promised a much faster web and Cloudflare rolled out HTTP/2 access for all our customers long, long ago. But one feature of HTTP/2, Prioritization, didn’t live up to the hype. Not because it was fundamentally broken but because of the way browsers implemented it. Historically the browser has been in control of deciding how and when web content is loaded. Today we are introducing a radical change to that model for all paid plans that puts control into the hands of the site owner directly. 另附：[Parallel streaming of progressive images](https://blog.cloudflare.com/parallel-streaming-of-progressive-images/)、[Faster script loading with BinaryAST?](https://blog.cloudflare.com/binary-ast/).

**The lifecycle and performance of a Lucet instance**  
https://www.fastly.com/blog/lucet-performance-and-lifecycle  
We recently announced [Lucet](https://www.fastly.com/blog/announcing-lucet-fastly-native-webassembly-compiler-runtime), our native WebAssembly compiler and runtime, and have been so excited by the community’s interest. In this post, we’ll explain how the Lucet runtime system works by sharing what happens at each step of the lifecycle of a WebAssembly program running on Lucet. We’ll also detail how we keep the overhead of each step as low as possible.

**Visualizing Traffic Safety with Uber Movement Data and Kepler.gl**  
https://eng.uber.com/kepler-data-visualization-traffic-safety/  
Urban traffic can be dangerous, a point known all too well by city dwellers and drivers. Discovering the most dangerous street locations in a city can help urban planners take steps to enhance safety through strategies such as lower speed limits or traffic rerouting. Among its many uses, data visualization delivers the insights urban planners can use to better manage traffic in cities.

**API design: Why you should use links, not keys, to represent relationships in APIs**  
https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/application-development/api-design-why-you-should-use-links-not-keys-to-represent-relationships-in-apis  
While links aren’t widely used in APIs, some very prominent web APIs use links based on HTTP URLs to represent relationships, for example the Google Drive API and the GitHub API. Why is that? In this post, I'll show what using API foreign keys looks like in practice, explain its disadvantages compared to the use of links, and show you how to convert that design to one that uses links.

**Build your own WebAssembly Compiler**  
https://blog.scottlogic.com/2019/05/17/webassembly-compiler.html  
Have you ever wanted to write your own compiler? … yes? … of course you have! I’ve always wanted to have a go at writing a compiler, and with the recent release of WebAssembly, I had the perfect excuse to have a go. So, rather than waste all that work - I thought I’d write up my talk as a blog post instead - hence the ‘19 min’ reading time for this article.

**The origin story of data science**  
https://www.welcometothejungle.co/fr/articles/story-origin-data-science  
Along the way to becoming the field that we know now, data science received a lot of criticism from academics and journalists who saw no distinction between it and statistics, especially during the period 2010–2015. The difference may not have been obvious to them without a statistician’s background. Here, we examine the origins of this field to get a better understanding of why it is a distinct academic discipline. And since it’s a story better understood when looked at through the individuals involved in creating it, let’s meet the four people who pushed the boundaries of statistics: John Tukey, John Chambers, Leo Breiman, and Bill Cleveland.

**As search needs evolve, Microsoft makes AI tools for better search available to researchers and developers**  
https://blogs.microsoft.com/ai/bing-vector-search/  
The Bing team said they expect the open source offering could be used for enterprise or consumer-facing applications to identify a language being spoken based on an audio snippet, or for image-heavy services such as an app that lets people take pictures of flowers and identify what type of flower it is. For those types of applications, a slow or irrelevant search experience is frustrating. 另附：[Introducing Translatotron: An End-to-End Speech-to-Speech Translation Model](https://ai.googleblog.com/2019/05/introducing-translatotron-end-to-end.html)、[New ML Kit features easily bring Machine Learning to your apps](https://developers.googleblog.com/2019/05/new-ml-kit-features-easily-bring.html).

https://blog.ionicframework.com/announcing-stencil-one-beta/  
Stencil, is an open source (MIT) toolchain that builds reusable, scalable Design Systems by combining the best features from popular frontend frameworks and generating standard Web Components (instead of a third-party component model). Stencil was first announced in 2017 at Polymer Summit by my colleagues, Adam Bradley and Max Lynch. Originally called “Ionic core” internally, Stencil was born out of our desire to solve our own JS Framework dependency problems and increase performance for Ionic Framework. As it turns out, Stencil ended up solving a lot more than that.

**What to Expect From Marzipan**  
https://blog.iconfactory.com/2019/05/what-to-expect-from-marzipan/  
It’s clear that this year’s WWDC is going to be a doozy. We’ve written here previously with our thoughts about Dark Mode, now it’s time to talk about iOS apps coming to the Mac. Of course I’m talking about Marzipan, a technology Apple introduced with few details during last year’s Keynote.

**Getting Started with Svelte 3**  
https://alligator.io/svelte/getting-started-with-svelte/  
[Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) is a UI framework of sorts that barrows a lot or the great ideas from some of its peers like React and Vue.js, but brings about its own interesting ideas to the table. Plus, it’s not entirely a framework in the sense that we’re used to and is perhaps better seen as a compiler.

**How Frontend Developers Can Help To Bridge The Gap Between Designers And Developers**  
https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2019/05/frontend-developers-designers/  
Developers are known to usually be the last ones who leave their fingerprints before a website or any sort of web product gets shipped. Obviously, a lot of responsibility is involved and the quality of their work can either make a project excel or go down the drain. This article gives suggestions about what frontend developers can do on their end to better bridge the gap between designers and developers.

**Wolfram|Alpha at 10**  
https://blog.stephenwolfram.com/2019/05/wolframalpha-at-10/  
https://blog.stephenwolfram.com/2019/05/launching-today-free-wolfram-engine-for-developers/  
Today it’s 10 years since we launched Wolfram|Alpha. At some level, Wolfram|Alpha is a never-ending project. But it’s had a great first 10 years. It was a unique and surprising achievement when it first arrived, and over its first decade it’s become ever stronger and more unique. It’s found its way into more and more of the fabric of the computational world, both realizing some of the long-term aspirations of artificial intelligence, and defining new directions for what one can expect to be possible. Oh, and by now, a significant fraction of a billion people have used it. And we’ve been able to keep it private and independent, and its main website has stayed free and without external advertising.

**The Complete Guide to Deep Work**  
https://doist.com/blog/complete-guide-to-deep-work/  
Let’s get right to the point: bouncing between your inbox, pointless meetings, and group chat notifications is no way to get ahead in today’s information economy. These are markers of busyness not productivity. They won’t help you to deepen your writing practice, master a programming language, or grow your business. In fact, these activities won’t aid you in any number of the ambitious goals you’ve set for yourself. Instead, succumbing to these attention traps leads you off the path of excellence and down the road of mediocrity. To be truly exceptional at the work you do, and to gain recognition for it, you’ll need to adopt a different strategy entirely. Enter “deep work”.

**The struggles of an open source maintainer**  
http://antirez.com/news/129  
Months ago the maintainer of an OSS project in the sphere of system software, with quite a big and active community, wrote me an email saying that he struggles to continue maintaining his project after so many years, because of how much psychologically taxing such effort is. He was looking for advices from me, I’m not sure to be in the position of giving advices, however I told him I would write a blog post about what I think about the matter.

很多人认为程序员应该供的神里面排名第一的应该是Linus Torvalds，因为他是Linux和Git之父。然而我要试图反驳这个观点，因为地球上有另外一位伟大的程序员，有超过四代码农用他的开发工具吃饭。Linus只用C编程而且不到30年，而这位神级程序员在近40年中一直创造引领潮流的开发工具(Turbo Pascal/Delphi/C#/TypeScript)，他就是Anders Hejlsberg。

东京的一个设计展，让我们看到就算足不出户，也能替我们打通远方某座城市的任督二脉。有时候，它在我们心中埋下的问号和期待，价值不亚于旅行本身。这个超人气展览的主角，是NHK从七年前开始播出至今的儿童节目「Designあ（读作“啊”，日语50音中的第一个字母）」。

**陆奇如何评价萨提亚**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/BRyZP0LDIYoopIvz4VK0Kw  
过去高科技工业的发展历史，每一个新的拐点或者起点，基本上是由新一代计算平台所驱动，这个计算平台里面有个重要的一环，我把它叫做“定义性的用户体验”，比如互联网定义性用户体验，其实是最早的浏览器Mosaic；PC时代定义性体验，基本是Win95；移动互联网的定义性体验就是第一个iPhone。如何观察是不是到了下一个时代拐点，我们要关注是不是有新的定义性用户体验，当你第一次看到iPhone，就知道这不一样，我们以前没有这个，这会启动一个新的时代。中国的产品更容易出海，因为相对美国来说，中国与其他国家的“距离”在用户体验上更接近。从某种意义上来讲，中国创业者有这样一个历史性的机遇，第一次在美国之外，有这样一个机会，可以用全球化思维来考虑创新。另附：[陆奇在知乎的课程 - AI 本质与创业创新](https://www.zhihu.com/remix/albums/1109442471616065536).
