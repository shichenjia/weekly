**V8 release v7.6**  
https://v8.dev/blog/v8-release-76  
V8 v7.6 is filled with all sorts of developer-facing goodies. This post provides a preview of some of the highlights in anticipation of the release. 另附：[V8 - Code caching for WebAssembly developers](https://v8.dev/blog/wasm-code-caching).

**Reactive Systems Architecture**  
https://www.infoq.com/presentations/arch-reactive-systems/  
Jan Machacek and Matthew Squire give us the answer to the click-baity headline “Four things that make the biggest impact in distributed systems”, together with architectural and code examples to help avoid repeating their mistakes.

**How we’re bringing Google Earth to the Web**  
https://web.dev/earth-webassembly  
Improving cross-browser access to Google Earth with WebAssembly.

**Facebook’s open source browser contributions**  
https://code.fb.com/web/browser-contributions/  
Thanks to some powerful new technologies, web applications have come a long way in the past decade. But the performance of these web applications still lags behind that of their native counterparts. Like many complex applications on the web, our desktop Facebook.com website is slower to load than our native mobile Android app on the same hardware — even though the web app loads an order of magnitude less code. We wanted to improve the startup time of web apps by improving the web platform, so we initiated several projects to help the web scale as a platform for large applications.

**Try Bazel’s opt-in preview in Angular CLI**  
https://blog.angular.io/try-bazels-opt-in-preview-in-angular-cli-b9430bd00e82  
In Google we build all our software with a tool called Bazel. We’ve been using it for the past over 12 years to build projects with any size — from small internal apps, to large applications such as Gmail, Google Drive, and Google Cloud Console. Thanks to its properties — hermeticity, parallelism, and incrementality, Bazel enables fast builds, which are proportional to the changes that we’ve made, rebuilding only the artifacts that are affected by the updated files.

**Microfrontends: the good, the bad, and the ugly**  
https://zendev.com/2019/06/17/microfrontends-good-bad-ugly.html  
Front-end twitter exploded last week talking about ‘microfrontends’, with strong arguments and strong opinions jumping out on both sides. The argument reminds me a lot about the “CSS in JS” argument, with both sides talking past each other. I’ve certainly been guilty of that in the past, but this time I’m going to try for a more nuanced approach. I think just like with CSS in JS, there are real tradeoffs and differences depending on your project and organizational constraints. There are also good approaches and bad approaches to implementing microfrontends. So here we go, let’s take a look at the good, the bad, and the ugly of microfrontends.

**支付宝玉伯：从前端到体验，如何把格局做大**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/kUBGjcP2nz2KdVwTW0FSSw  
国内的前端行业，是一个群星璀璨，同时又有些纷纷扰扰的圈子。很多初出茅庐的年轻人怀着改变世界的梦想，谁也不服谁。不过，有一些为前端领域做出贡献的拓荒者几乎受到所有人的尊敬，玉伯就是这些拓荒者中的一员。如今，他已经是蚂蚁金服研究员，带领着体验技术部，打造出 Ant Design、AntV、Eggjs 等广受欢迎的开源项目，他所在的团队也成为国内前端开发者向往的地方。

**七牛云许式伟：我所理解的架构是什么**  
https://www.infoq.cn/article/scbBuLydXi00sZ4v*UyN  
今天站在管理的视角再看软件工程，我们知道管理学谈的是确定性，我们如何去创造确定性是管理学中的追求，否则管理管什么呢？某种意义上来说管理学的目的就是要抑制不确定性，产生确定性。比如说开发的工期，时间成本是否能确定。其次，人力成本，研发成本和后期运维的成本是不是确定性的。所以软件项目的管理又期望达到确定性。这是一对矛盾。软件工程本身是快速变化的，是不确定的。但是软件工程管理又希望得到确定性，这就是软件工程管理上的矛盾。我们的目标是在大量的不确定性中找到确定性，这是我认为这件事情最核心的点。

A detailed walk-through of all the core components that are involved in the execution of JavaScript code.

**Chromium and the browser monoculture problem**  
https://dev.to/kenbellows/chromium-and-the-browser-monoculture-problem-420n  
I've been thinking a lot about an oooold problem in the web dev community, one that's been the subject of 🔥flamewars🔥 basically since web browsers have existed: "browser monoculture". This topic has flared up again recently as a result of Microsoft dropping their EdgeHTML browser engine and moving Edge to Google's Chromium engine.

**Low-Code vs. No-Code:  Form Following Function**  
https://www.outsystems.com/blog/posts/low-code-vs-no-code/  
There are a number of very significant differences between low-code and no-code platforms, if you’re considering moving away from traditional application development, or even just want to try out visual application development, you’ll want to be aware of what you’re getting in each offering. Let’s get to the bottom of the low-code vs no-code phenom and see precisely what’s what.

**The CSS Mindset**  
https://mxb.dev/blog/the-css-mindset/  
Ah yes, CSS. Hardly a week passes without it being the topic of a heated online discussion. It’s too hard. It’s too simple. It’s unpredictable. It’s outdated. Peter Griffin struggles with blinds dot gif. I don’t know why CSS sparks so many different emotions in developers, but I have a hunch as to why it can sometimes seem illogical or frustrating: You need a certain mindset to write good CSS.

**Relearn CSS layout**  
https://every-layout.dev/

**Trapped in the Present: How engagement bias in short-run experiments can blind you to long-run insights**  
https://medium.com/@Pinterest_Engineering/trapped-in-the-present-how-engagement-bias-in-short-run-experiments-can-blind-you-to-long-run-58b55ad3bda0  
Like many companies, Pinterest uses experiments to make product decisions multiple times a day. But as Jed Bartlett said on The West Wing, “decisions are made by those who show up”: we make decisions based on the users who actually enter our experiments, and that means we have to understand engagement bias if we want to both make Pinterest work better for existing Pinners and also inspire the next generation of Pinners to create the life they love.

**Serverless is a Doctrine, not a Technology**  
https://medium.com/@PaulDJohnston/serverless-is-a-doctrine-not-a-technology-4193ccb66cfc  
Serverless is a doctrine. What is doctrine? For our purposes, a doctrine is a set of principles that you have learned from experience, and codified into some written form e.g. a set of best practices… like my best practices blog post… 另附：[From a high traffic monolithic app to serverless](https://skyscrapers.eu/insights/transforming-a-monolithic-app-to-a-serverless-app).

**Using Causal Inference to Improve the Uber User Experience**  
https://eng.uber.com/causal-inference-at-uber/  
At Uber Labs, we apply behavioral science insights and methodologies to help product teams improve the Uber customer experience. One of the most exciting areas we’ve been working on is causal inference, a category of statistical methods that is commonly used in behavioral science research to understand the causes behind the results we see from experiments or observations. We’ve found it invaluable to bring causal inference methods to our work at Uber, as it enables us to solve challenging but critical data science questions that would otherwise be impossible to tackle, such as estimating the treatment effect when a randomized controlled experiment is not possible or addressing additional complexities within the experimental data.

**The State of CSS 2019**  
https://2019.stateofcss.com/  
In the web development family, JavaScript has developed a bit of a reputation as the angry, rebellious teenager going through a new phase every year and telling you you're just too old to understand. CSS on the other hand has always been the studious, well-behaved kid who always stays polite and never makes a rash decision. We've surveyed over 10,000 developers in this first ever State of CSS survey. So join us to find out which CSS features are used the most, which tools are gaining adoption, and much more.

**MongoDB Charts is now Generally Available**  
https://www.mongodb.com/blog/post/mongodb-charts-is-now-generally-available  
Visualizing data using charts, maps, and tables is one of the best ways to make that data accessible to all and unlocking the insights within it. A collection of a million documents may be detailed and accurate, but doesn’t on its own tell stories about trends, outliers or anomalies. Even a simple bar or line chart over that data can unlock its secrets.

**Google to reimplement curl in libcrurl**  
https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2019/06/19/google-to-reimplement-curl-in-libcrurl/  
Implementing libcurl using Cronet would allow developers to take advantage of the utility of the Chrome Network Stack, without having to learn a new interface and its corresponding workflow. This would ideally increase ease of accessibility of Cronet, and overall improve adoption of Cronet by first-party or third-party applications.

**Drop caps & design systems**  
https://product.voxmedia.com/2019/6/17/18524029/the-ballad-of-drop-caps-and-design-systems 
A drop cap is often used to signify that the reader’s moved into a significant new section, or that a new chapter’s begun. On the web, we use drop caps for similar reasons: both as a design accent, and as a visual cue to draw the reader’s eye toward an important piece of text. In the web’s early days, designers like Jason Santa Maria and Jessica Hische helped popularize the technique; more recently, Jason Pamental and Jen Simmons have showed us more modern techniques for bringing drop caps to the web.
