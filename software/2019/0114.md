**Front-End Performance Checklist 2019**  
https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2019/01/front-end-performance-checklist-2019-pdf-pages/  
If we created an overview of all the things we have to keep in mind when improving performance — from the very start of the process until the final release of the website — what would that list look like? Below you’ll find a (hopefully unbiased and objective) front-end performance checklist for 2019 — an updated overview of the issues you might need to consider to ensure that your response times are fast, user interaction is smooth and your sites don’t drain user’s bandwidth.

**Node.js Performance Tuning and Testing**  
https://stackify.com/node-js-performance-tuning/  
We know Node.js for its lightning-fast performance. Yet, as with any language, you can write Node.js code that performs worse for your users than you’d like. To combat this, we need adequate performance testing. Today, we will cover just that with an in-depth look at how to set up and run a performance test and analyze the results so you can make lightning-fast Node.js applications.

**Node.js & JavaScript Testing Best Practices**  
https://medium.com/@me_37286/yoni-goldberg-javascript-nodejs-testing-best-practices-2b98924c9347

Some examples are illustrated using Jest, others with Mocha — this post is less about tooling and more about the right approach and techniques.

**Defensive JavaScript**  
https://www.javascriptjanuary.com/blog/defensive-javascript  
How to write code that doesn't do what it oughtn't Sometimes we developers are asked to wear many different hats.

If you couldn’t care less for Adobe XD, or don’t want to know what XD has to offer, do yourself a favour and scroll down and read the section “Why Adobe XD will dominate, regardless of features” before crossing XD off your list. There are many other UX/UI design tools outside of Sketch and InVision. Figma, Framer and Protopie to name a few, but Sketch and InVision seem to be dominating the field. The question we need to ask is, is their reign about to come to an end? 另附：[The Best UX Tools (with Infographic)](https://www.toptal.com/designers/ux/best-ux-tools-infographic).
