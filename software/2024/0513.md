**Declarative Design**  
https://adactio.com/articles/21110. 
Ten years after John published A Dao Of Web Design on A List Apart, Ethan Marcotte published Responsive Web Design on A List Apart. And the first thing he does in this article is he quotes John Allsopp’s A Dao Of Web Design. He was building on top of it. It was the same approach, the same mindset that was behind responsive web design. That was 2010. And now, are we in a new era? Is it time for the next phase? A new era of declarative design maybe?

**The Case for Human-Centered Project Management**  
https://www.viget.com/articles/the-case-for-human-centered-project-management/  
The idea is simple: build a project ecosystem that effectively supports the real humans working within it, and those humans will be poised to do their best work and deliver a quality product every time. Let’s take a look at the four principles of Human-Centered Design (and a few supporting social work concepts) as they relate to the management of digital project ecosystems.

从阿里出来之后，玉伯怎么回看过往15年的工作呢？会怎么审视自我，究竟能干什么？有什么能力？优势在哪？能对他人提供的价值是什么？擅长什么，做不好什么？喜欢什么？有些事情为什么是他？AI不是今年才火，为什么不是从蚂蚁出来就创业？为什么要加入飞书？怎么不到一年又就要离开？感受到字节和阿里的像跟不像是什么？另附：[云凤-重新启程](https://blog.codingnow.com/2024/05/farewell.html)、[致taobao.com用户的一封信:PC Web 重出江湖](https://bbs.taobao.com/detail.html?postId=10328201)。

**Open Source is at a crossroads**  
https://www.lightbend.com/blog/open-source-is-at-a-crossroads  
The cracks are beginning to show in this global ecosystem, as many projects lack the basic funding to sustain the software that literally runs the world. Open source software is having a midlife crisis. Open source contributors are struggling to keep pace. Popular open source projects are making restrictive licensing changes. Backdoor threats are placing the open source supply chain in jeopardy. And, no one seems to have a clear grasp on what “open” means in the context of artificial intelligence.

**At some point, JavaScript got good**  
https://jonbeebe.net/2024/05/javascript-got-good/  
After the big “boost” that JavaScript got with ECMAScript 2015 (ES6), there have been continuous improvements to the language and it just keeps getting better. Because of the wide range of implementations, the use of transpilers has become standard in the community, so we can all take advantage of the newest JavaScript features on a per-project basis, without worrying (too much) about what each individual JS engine supports.

**Design Taste vs. Technical Skills in the Era of AI**  
https://www.nngroup.com/articles/taste-vs-technical-skills-ai/  
The need for discernment is amplified when generative AI enables anyone to create anything. Creative skills will still be necessary to produce superior designs.

**Development notes from xkcd's "Machine"**  
https://chromakode.com/post/xkcd-machine/  
On April 5th, xkcd released Machine, the 15th annual April Fools project I’ve made with them. It’s a game we’d been dreaming of for years: a giant rube goldberg machine builder in the style of the classic Incredible Machine games, made of a patchwork of machines created by individual xkcd readers. For more details, check out Explain xkcd’s wonderful writeup. This is the story of how we built Machine in 3 weeks, and what I learned along the way.

**The evolution of Figma’s mobile engine: Compiling away our custom programming language**  
https://www.figma.com/blog/figmas-journey-to-typescript-compiling-away-our-custom-programming-language/  
We’ve long written core parts of our mobile rendering architecture in Skew, the custom programming language we invented to squeeze additional performance out of our playback engine. Here’s how we automatically migrated Skew to TypeScript without disrupting a single day of development.

**Design Docs at Google**  
https://www.industrialempathy.com/posts/design-docs-at-google/  
https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40273534  
Design docs are a great way to gain clarity and achieve consensus around solving the hardest problems in a software project. They save money, because they avoid going down coding rabbit holes that fail to achieve project goals and could have been avoided using upfront investigation; and they cost money, because creation and review take time. So, choose wisely for your project!

**The Nature of Code (2nd Edition)**  
https://natureofcode.com/introduction/  
Over a decade ago, I self-published The Nature of Code, an online resource and print book exploring the unpredictable evolutionary and emergent properties of nature in software via the creative coding framework Processing. It’s the understatement of the century to say that much has changed in the world of technology and creative media since then, and so here I am again, with a new and rebooted version of this book built around JavaScript and the p5.js library. The book has a few new coding tricks this time, but it’s the same old nature—birds still flap their wings, and apples still fall on our heads.

**有真人真生活才有真学问**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/WubyPQsR6zP2IwyE2sreaw  
东方的教育，侧重“行”，把真实的生活，真人的一言一行，饮食之间，作为了道场，在这里面去“感”，去应对，去互动，去感受，去变化。这个就是东方的学习方式——格物致知。没有真人，真生活，哪有真学问。
