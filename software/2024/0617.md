**The empty brain**

Your brain does not process information, retrieve knowledge or store memories. In short: your brain is not a computer

**The stabilization process of the Standard Library has begun**  
https://deno.com/blog/stabilize-std  
We are excited to announce a significant milestone for the Deno Standard Library: The packages of the Deno Standard Library are going to be stabilized to version 1.0 shortly. This means that any code working with a stabilized v1 version will continue to work, adhering to semantic versioning. 

**Why we should care about process**  
https://blog.scottlogic.com/2024/06/10/why-we-should-care-about-process.html  
One of the principles behind the Manifesto for Agile Software Development is: “The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.” It’s a simple statement but it hides a big idea. The first and maybe most obvious question is, “What is a self-organizing team?” The Scrum guide has this to say: “Self-organizing teams choose how best to accomplish their work, rather than being directed by others outside the team.” Again, very simple but quite powerful.

**How to compose JavaScript functions that take multiple parameters (the epic guide)**  
https://jrsinclair.com/articles/2024/how-to-compose-functions-that-take-multiple-parameters-epic-guide/  
We work around the limitation by changing our functions. That is, we can wrap or modify them. We transform our multi-argument functions into unary functions. In this article, we’ll look at five techniques for doing that. (There are more, but these are the most common.)

**How we improved push processing on GitHub**  
https://github.blog/2024-06-11-how-we-improved-push-processing-on-github/  
Pushing code to GitHub is one of the most fundamental interactions that developers have with GitHub every day. Read how we have significantly improved the ability of our monolith to correctly and fully process pushes from our users.

**the future is built on solid foundations**  
https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/the-future-is-built-on-solid-foundations/  
In conclusion, organizations with solid design system foundations are best positioned to leverage AI and other emerging technologies. A robust design system ensures consistency, scalability, and efficiency, making the integration process smoother and more effective. As technology continues to evolve, investing in and maintaining a strong design system will be crucial for organizations aiming to stay competitive and future-ready.

**Serverless Jupyter Notebooks at Meta**  
https://engineering.fb.com/2024/06/10/data-infrastructure/serverless-jupyter-notebooks-bento-meta/  
Here’s how we married Bento with this in-browser, serverless code execution technology to power our notebooks platform for these lite workloads.

**My thoughts on Python in Excel**  
https://www.xlwings.org/blog/my-thoughts-on-python-in-excel  
There’s definitely a place for Python in Excel, but integrating a classic Jupyter notebook instead of placing the cells in the Excel sheet itself would have been much better, in my opinion. Don’t forget that Python in Excel is still in preview as of today, so we’re likely to get improvements and fewer restrictions in the future.

我们每个人，在年轻时都有许多梦，但后来在现实的压力之下，渐渐地远离了，淡忘了。甚至有很多人，都曾经有过和袁辉一样的“支教梦”，却在毕业时，在工作后，因种种原因，而无法实现，只能永远存留在梦中，作为曾经青春过、浪漫过的一丝证明与记念。我们没有想过，梦想之路，其实也许并不遥远，就在脚下。如果愿意出发，你就能够到达。而且，走在梦想的路上，竟然会有如此动人心魄的幸福。这是我们本来可以得到，却亲手放弃了的呀。
