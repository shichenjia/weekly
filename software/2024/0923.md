**Why Scrum is Stressing You Out**  
https://rethinkingsoftware.substack.com/p/why-scrum-is-stressing-you-out  
Why would sprints be more stressful? Aren't they just more frequent, shorter deadlines as opposed to the occasional really big one? Doesn’t this save you from having to crunch at the end of a project? This reasoning seems logical, but it overlooks some important details in the real, lived experience of today's software developers. Here's how I think sprints are doing us wrong.

**A gentle guide to self-hosting your software**  
https://knhash.in/gentle-guide-to-self-hosting/  
And like every hobby there are a lot of gatekeepers. People who believe having a personal server that you can touch is a necessity to call yourself a self-hoster. Eh. Don't listen to them. Self-hosting is as much about the software as it is about the hardware. I say we get the enthusiasts by any means necessary; they will eventually grow into full-fledged self-hosting. Or not. It doesn't matter! This is supposed to be fun, why are you stopping people from having fun?

**The weird web of the 90s**  
https://gomakethings.com/the-weird-web-of-the-90s/  
A lot of folks in the Indie Web space refer to this a digital garden. While I like the idea in concept, the idea of an entire-website-as-a-wiki always felt too limiting, too rigid for me. But then I stumbled onto Tom Critchlow’s article on Streams, Campfires, and Gardens, and something clicked. My personal site isn’t just a digital garden.

**AI code generation as an agent of tech debt creation**  
https://greaterdanorequalto.com/ai-code-generation-as-an-agent-of-tech-debt-creation/  
That famous Steve Jobs saying, "A players hire A players, B players hire C players?" Well, it may have been heartless, but there's a logic to it. That said, I think it needs updating for the modern era: "A players hire A players, B players hire C players who hire AI chatbots and pretty soon nobody knows how the fuck anything works anymore."

**How Discord Reduced Websocket Traffic by 40%**  
https://discord.com/blog/how-discord-reduced-websocket-traffic-by-40-percent  
At Discord, we’re always thinking about ways to improve our services and increase performance. After all, the faster our app gets, the sooner you can return to your friends and conversations! Over the last six months, we embarked on a quest to support this endeavor, working to reduce the amount of bandwidth our clients use, especially on iOS and Android, hoping that decreasing bandwidth usage would lead to a more responsive experience.

**Optimising for High Latency Environments**  
https://csswizardry.com/2024/09/optimising-for-high-latency-environments/  
Chrome have recently begun adding Round-Trip-Time (RTT) data to the Chrome User Experience Report (CrUX). This gives fascinating insights into the network topography of our visitors, and how much we might be impacted by high latency regions.

**Embracing Introversion In UX**  
https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2024/09/embracing-introversion-in-ux/  
This article celebrates the power of introversion in UX research and design, going beyond what has been covered in existing discussions on the topic. Victor Yocco debunks common misconceptions, highlights the unique strengths introverted researchers and designers bring, and offers practical tips for thriving in a field that often seems geared toward extroverts — all sprinkled with real stories from introverted UX practitioners.

**Goodhart's Law in Software Engineering**  
https://buttondown.com/hillelwayne/archive/goodharts-law-in-software-engineering/  
I guess the best I can do is say "use your best engineering judgement"? Evolution is mindless, people aren't. Again, not an actionable or scalable bit of advice, but as I grow older I keep finding "use your best judgement" is all we can do. Knowledge work is ineffable and irreducible.

**你二十分钟练的，把你一天损耗的精神都能收回来**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/aKIGKkyaTfd08APCbhUmcQ  
大家首先学《八部金刚》，先保护你的身体健康。那么今天会上有些人提出来，我打坐我不练功行不行？行嘛，你不练，你没时间就不练嘛。你先保护你的健康啊，你不定啥时候你感冒你那么，你一感冒你开始一练，马上就好，很容易，几十年的病都能好了嘛，还把你那一点感冒不好？是不是啊。

**刘力红 | 关于“五福”的思考与认识**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/4Im6AjSQto0tC5pGVWin7A  
在《尚书·洪范》里，洪范九畴最后就是五福。大家都想五福临门，但是我们种了五福的种子没有？我们有这个五福的因没有？然后我们创造了五福的条件了没有？最后才有五福的结果。就万事万物都不离这些因素。今天就一起看看刘力红老师在第四届同有班第六次大课上怎么说~

**李辛 | 气血不足的人，如何收回能量？**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/fUEw4QTHAbUY6pLvMN46gg  
中医课常常需要提到“开阖”。当我们太疲劳、精力不够的时候，其实是开过了。现代社会无处不在“开”，所以，我们每一个人要注意“阖”的部分。给自己一些独处的时间，或者安静地听一首音乐或看一段自己喜欢的书，或者找到空隙闭目养神，哪怕只有三五分钟，这些都是阖。阖，就是把能量收回来。

**今日秋分：人生的最高境界，一半烟火，一半清欢！**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/sTysn151DPpWAjN0COjm-A  
《中庸》里讲，“喜怒哀乐之未发，谓之中，发而皆中节，谓之和；中也者，天下之大本也；和也者，天下之大道也。致中和，天地位焉，万物育焉。”。人的喜怒哀乐没有表现出来的时候是中，表现出来合乎法度，没有过度也没有不及就是和。中是天地万物的根本，和是天下共同遵循的道理，达到中与和的境界，万物就可以和谐共生了。天地阴阳达到中和的状态，则褪尽了酷暑的热烈焦躁，更未到冬季的寒冷刺骨，空气中带着清新的稻香与白露的滋润，令人内心平静，开阔惬意，就是一年里最好的时节。

回望过去一年，浙江儿女都很努力，拼出了各自的精彩。那么，6600多万浙江人的奋斗，拼出了怎样的时代图景？从省域层面来说，浙江展开了怎样的实践，又交出了怎样的答卷？对此，浙江干部群众很关注，社会各界拭目以待。
