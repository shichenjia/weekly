**Good Product People**  
https://www.svpg.com/good-product-people/  
The subject of this article is that I do not think it is a coincidence that so many of the best product people I know are in fact engineers. Many people gravitate towards engineering because they see technology as the means to enable them to solve these tough problems.  But the best engineers don’t constrain their thinking to just feasibility and the enabling technology.  They care deeply about value, viability and usability as well, and spend real time and effort educating themselves about these factors.

**UI Density**  
https://matthewstrom.com/writing/ui-density/  
What UI density means and how to design for it. 

**The next decade of the web**  
https://jamesg.blog/2024/05/19/next-web-decade/  
After the last decade, where platforms have emerged as a core constituent of the web on which many rely, it may feel like things cannot change. That the giants are so big that there is no other way. Yet, to give into this feeling -- that things can't change -- is not necessary. It is the way it is is not true on the web. We can make change. It's your web.

**You should keep a developer’s journal**  
https://stackoverflow.blog/2024/05/22/you-should-keep-a-developer-s-journal/  
A developer’s journal is a place to define the problem you’re solving and record what you tried and what worked.

**Introducing Copilot+ PCs**  
https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2024/05/20/introducing-copilot-pcs/

**Bun - A fast-rising star?**  
https://blog.scottlogic.com/2024/05/21/bunjs-a-fast-rising-star.html  
The problem I was struggling to solve was: “What can I use this on?”. Our client work would be an ideal candidate, we certainly saw issues with Node.js slowness that Bun had the potential to help with, however in the world of Fintech, new and fancy also means unknown and risky, and adopting new tech can be a hard case to make.

**On compliance vs readability: Generating text colors with CSS**  
https://lea.verou.me/blog/2024/contrast-color/  
Can we emulate the upcoming CSS contrast-color() function via CSS features that have already widely shipped? And if so, what are the tradeoffs involved and how to best balance them?

**Coding my Handwriting — Amy Goodchild**  
https://www.amygoodchild.com/blog/cursive-handwriting-in-javascript  
A little while ago I created a block script in JavaScript, thinking that cursive would be too complex. But here I am, two months later, ready to talk about the cursive handwriting I’ve created. There is perhaps a lesson in that but let’s not dwell on it. 

**Data Fetching Patterns in Single-Page Applications**  
https://martinfowler.com/articles/data-fetch-spa.html#IntroducingUserdetailcardComponent  
When a single-page application needs to fetch data from a remote source, it needs to do so while remaining responsive and providing feedback to the user during an often slow query. Five patterns help with this. Asynchronous State Handler wraps these queries with meta-queries for the state of the query. Parallel Data Fetching minimizes wait time. Fallback Markup specifies fallback displays in markup. Code Splitting loads only code that's needed. Prefetching gathers data before it may needed to reduce latency when it is.

**NoCode Will Not Bring Computing to the Masses**  
https://buttondown.email/hillelwayne/archive/nocode-will-not-bring-computing-to-the-masses/  
NoCode, scripting vs applications, and software marketplaces

**Consensus in Internet Standards**  
https://www.mnot.net/blog/2024/05/24/consensus  
It’s common for voluntary technical standards developing organisations (SDOs such as the IETF and W3C) to make decisions by consensus, rather than (for example) voting. This post explores why we use consensus, what it is, how it works in Internet standards and when its use can become problematic.

**Composable data management at Meta**  
https://engineering.fb.com/2024/05/22/data-infrastructure/composable-data-management-at-meta/  
This ambitious program had a three-fold goal: (a) to increase the engineering efficiency of our organization by minimizing the duplication of work; (b) to improve the experience of internal data users through more consistent semantics across these engines, and ultimately, (c) to accelerate the pace of innovation in data management.

**再怀国士：袁隆平先生逝世三周年祭**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/Vh3eAgtXV3KLL3nqCJYJfA  
这个世界，有太多人孜孜以求的，都是追名逐利，但袁老给我们指明了另一条路，树立了一个不一样的标杆。当若干年过去，名和利终将成空，只有给世界创造的价值不朽；追逐名利的人会被遗忘，而创造价值的人会被人民永远铭记。袁老已去，但袁老也将永生于人民心中。这世上没有神仙，也无需立庙。因为每一缕升起的炊烟，都是飘自人间的怀念。

**《毛选》：人生就是，急也没用，找回掌控感才是本质**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/5l6Lwe6-8uMlBgiQPOIMpg  
找回生活的掌控感，不是一蹴而就的。需要从小事做起，从调整自己的节奏开始。读书，不问收获，只问耕耘，慢下来，感受生活的节奏。尝试每天早起十分钟，不是为了赶工作，而是去感受清晨的空气；或者，在午休时，不是刷手机，而是去散散步，看看天空，晒晒太阳。

**允许他人如他所是**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/xu8fKEiusrt-tCuPBHMg4w  
在允许的过程中，当你越来越靠近允许，允许对方如他所是的时候，你内在的智慧、内在的精微觉察，也在慢慢同步升起。

**蔡志忠：扫地看似普通，其实有很多功用**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/0LCYpoqVHIeicI9H7-YCeg  
只要专注，便能把一件普通的事升华成修行。再普通的事物，只要专注了，也能在其中发现深刻的道理，不需真的去吃斋念佛、诵经参禅。 

**青年返乡的“留”量密码**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/ENpnZIimmsg0UdzLzkTq7w  
山野之路多崎岖，不少人感叹“返乡容易留乡难”。青年返乡每天要面对的，有诗情画意的田园牧歌，也有柴米油盐的烟火寻常。一些人浅尝辄止、悄然离场，还留下一句“城市安不了灵魂，故乡容不下肉身”，另一些人却深耕不息、融入乡村。
