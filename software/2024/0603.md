**How we used esbuild to reduce our browser extension build times by 90%**  
https://blog.1password.com/new-extension-build-system/  
The system that we use internally to build the code behind our browser extension was put together over half a decade ago. While we were able to iteratively grow it over time to meet our needs, it became slower and slower in the process. Let’s give it a much-needed upgrade!

**Why, after 6 years, I’m over GraphQL**  
https://bessey.dev/blog/2024/05/24/why-im-over-graphql/  
However, as the years have gone on and I have had the opportunity to deploy to environments where non functional requirements like security, performance, and maintainability were more of a concern, my perspective has changed. In this article I would like to take you through why today, I would not recommend GraphQL to most people, and what I think are better alternatives. Releated: [Want Out of React Complexity?

**Don't DRY Your Code Prematurely**  
https://testing.googleblog.com/2024/05/dont-dry-your-code-prematurely.html  
Many of us have been told the virtues of “Don’t Repeat Yourself” or DRY. Pause and consider: Is the duplication truly redundant or will the functionality need to evolve independently over time?  Applying DRY principles too rigidly leads to premature abstractions that make future changes more complex than necessary. Consider carefully if code is truly redundant or just superficially similar.

**Developers get by with a little help from AI: Stack Overflow Knows code assistant pulse survey results**  
https://stackoverflow.blog/2024/05/29/developers-get-by-with-a-little-help-from-ai-stack-overflow-knows-code-assistant-pulse-survey-results/  
While GenAI has been dominating the tech news cycles for a while, does all the AI hype translate into usage for professional developers? We tapped the Stack Overflow community for answers (I hear they like answering questions). Over 1,700 people told us what code assistant tools they are using, how they feel about them, and whether they feel more productive as a result. Releated:

**Data Fetching Patterns in Single-Page Applications**  
https://martinfowler.com/articles/data-fetch-spa.html  
When a single-page application needs to fetch data from a remote source, it needs to do so while remaining responsive and providing feedback to the user during an often slow query. Five patterns help with this. Asynchronous State Handler wraps these queries with meta-queries for the state of the query. Parallel Data Fetching minimizes wait time. Fallback Markup specifies fallback displays in markup. Code Splitting loads only code that's needed. Prefetching gathers data before it may needed to reduce latency when it is.

**Old Dogs, new CSS Tricks**

A lot of new CSS features have shipped in the last years, but actual usage is still low. While there are many different reasons for the slow adoption, I think one of the biggest barriers are our own brains.

**User Research Is Storytelling**  
https://alistapart.com/article/user-research-is-storytelling/  
Now, I realize that there’s an element of theater to UX—I hadn’t really considered it before, but user research is storytelling. And to get the most out of user research, you need to tell a good story where you bring stakeholders—the product team and decision makers—along and get them interested in learning more.

**What Happens to Old Software?**  
https://www.simplethread.com/what-happens-to-old-software/  
Old software needs love and guidance. Sometimes that means careful and vigilant protection, with layers of abstraction and modernization accreted around a highly conserved core. But more commonly, that means shepherding it along as the community migrates to greener pastures and newer features. It gets lonesome and dangerous out there if you find yourself left behind, but catching up isn’t impossible; a well-caulked wagon and a decent test suite can help you ford some pretty major version bumps and you’ll be up to date in no time.

**We're Watching Facebook Die**

Yet Meta has become a company that shows utter contempt for its users, turning products like Facebook and Insagram into algorithmic nightmares that undermine their core purpose, namely connecting people, while intentionally allowing malignant actors like anti-vaxers and spammers to thrive so that the numbers behind these arbitrary metrics goes up.
