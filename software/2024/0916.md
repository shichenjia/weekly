**A billion new developers thanks to AI?**  
https://christianheilmann.com/2024/09/12/a-billion-new-developers-thanks-to-ai/  
In general, however, these are very interesting times, and the market always needs more developers. I don’t think developers can be replaced yet, and I do think that intelligent and easily accessible development environments give a lot of new people the chance to get involved. The question is, how do I turn these newbies into developers who can also be proud of their work, and what can we do to make the next learning steps appealing to them after the AI ​​says “take this and everything will work”.

**Something went wrong**  
https://molily.de/something-went-wrong/  
Ways out of the JavaScript crisis.  We need to recognize that clichés, sermons, insults and righteousness have failed. We need to reconcile with mutual respect sharing the common goal of [making the web usable, accessible, secure and safe for everyone](https://www.w3.org/TR/ethical-web-principles/).

**The goal isn't to write less code**  
https://gomakethings.com/the-goal-isnt-to-write-less-code/  
It’s to ship less code to users. Better code. Faster code. More resilient code. For years, our industry has trended towards slower, buggier, more fragile, worse-in-every-measurable-way-except-speed code. It’s not better to produce a car in half the time with brakes that don’t work, and it’s not better to write code in less time if your users can’t actually use the fucking thing you built.

**From Design to Development Without Translation: How to Find the Real Source of Truth**

**Learning to Reason with LLMs**

We are introducing OpenAI o1, a new large language model trained with reinforcement learning to perform complex reasoning. o1 thinks before it answers—it can produce a long internal chain of thought before responding to the user. Releated:

**The State of ES5 on the Web**  
https://philipwalton.com/articles/the-state-of-es5-on-the-web/  
So what is the current state of ES5 on the web today? And what are the best practices for web developers when building code for production? This article looks at the data we have to answer these questions. It also offers some concrete recommendations (based on that data) for how both website developers and library authors should approach legacy browser support moving forward.

**The web's clipboard, and how it stores data of different types**  
https://alexharri.com/blog/clipboard  
If you've been using computers for a while, you probably know that the clipboard can store multiple types of data (images, rich text content, files, and so on). As a software developer, it started frustrating me that I didn't have a good understanding of how the clipboard stores and organizes data of different types. I recently decided to unveil the mystery that is the clipboard and wrote this post using my learnings. We'll focus on the web clipboard and its APIs, though we'll also touch on how it interacts with operating system clipboards.

**Gnome Files: A detailed UI examination**  
https://www.datagubbe.se/gnomefiles/  
Designing user interfaces is hard. Writing software is hard. Designing great interfaces and writing great software is even harder. No matter how hard you try, you can't please everyone. Functionally, Gnome Files lets me do file management. I could, if I had no other options, probably get used to its UI idiosyncrasies. But as I've hopefully demonstrated above, there are many things about Gnome Files - a central part of the Gnome desktop - that can be considered objectively bad from a UI design standpoint.

**Windows NT vs. Unix: A design comparison**  
https://blogsystem5.substack.com/p/windows-nt-vs-unix-design  
NT is often touted as a "very advanced" operating system. Why is that? What made NT better than Unix, if anything? And is that still the case?

**B-trees and database indexes**  
https://planetscale.com/blog/btrees-and-database-indexes  
B-trees are used by many modern DBMSs. Learn how they work, how databases use them, and how your choice of primary key can affect index performance.

本质都是同一个东西，回归到本源就是：气。我们身体内部无非气血，穴位只是气血的仓库和转运站。‍‍能够滋养我们身心的一切条件都叫气血。广义的气血是情绪神志、人际关系、社会支持、古往今来、天地万物等一切信息与能量。‍‍

内在的问题不解决，指望某一位中医或西医去替你解决不断出现的问题，不是明智的方法。不管是中医、西医，还是心理医生，他可以调整的范围也只是在某一个象限中，不一定能了解并处理所有的问题。希望大家心里能有一幅图，知道自己位于这个图的哪个部分，还缺哪些部分。

9月是收获的季节，也是学子们重返校园的时节。古代的“公立学校”长啥样吗？那个时候的学校也可以叫“学宫”，它带有庙学合一的特征，是历代王朝的官办教育机构和纪念儒家先贤、交流学术的场所。

**今天9月9日，一起缅怀毛主席！**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/M9ItOdsbd4DvDBaxsgZ1mw  
毛泽东的一生，无论是求学还是革命，即使最艰难、最艰苦、最黑暗的时期，在面临枪林弹雨的生死考验危急关口，他都能够自信豪迈，绝无消沉、绝无萎靡。这种强大的精神状态，为他的人生提供了无穷动力！毛泽东的一生，既有“问苍茫大地，谁主沉浮”的仰天长问，又有“到中流击水，浪遏飞舟”的浩然正气。
