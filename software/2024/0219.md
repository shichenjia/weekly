**Interop 2024**  
https://web.dev/blog/interop-2024?hl=en  
For Interop 2024, there was a public proposal process to source the initial list of features. From that list, all parties have worked together to create the list of focus areas for 2024. The following list includes the areas where we hope to see 100% of the selected tests passing by the end of the year.

**UI = f(statesⁿ)**  
https://daverupert.com/2024/02/ui-states/  
“UI is a function of state” is a pretty popular saying in the front-end world. In context (pun intended), that’s typically referring to application or component state. I thought I’d pull that thread a little further and explore all the states that can effect the UI layer…

**Paying people to work on open source is good actually**  
https://jacobian.org/2024/feb/16/paying-maintainers-is-good/  
Warning: rant ahead. I’m writing from a place of frustration and not particularly interested in trying to moderate my tone. If you don’t want to hear me yell about open source for a while, please skip this one.

**Engineering Practices for LLM Application Development**  
https://martinfowler.com/articles/engineering-practices-llm.html  
LLM engineering involves much more than just prompt design or prompt engineering. In this article, we share a set of engineering practices that helped us deliver a prototype LLM application rapidly and reliably in a recent project. We'll share techniques for automated testing and adversarial testing of LLM applications, refactoring, as well as considerations for architecting LLM applications and responsible AI. Releated:

**Bringing npm registry services to GitHub Codespaces**  
https://github.blog/2024-02-13-bringing-npm-registry-services-to-github-codespaces/  
The npm engineering team recently transitioned to using GitHub Codespaces for local development for npm registry services. This shift to Codespaces has substantially reduced the friction of our inner development loop and boosted developer productivity. Releated: [Get started with v4 of GitHub Actions Artifacts](https://github.blog/2024-02-12-get-started-with-v4-of-github-actions-artifacts/).  

**Vision Pro - Exploring Spatial Computing**  
https://willem.com/blog/2024-02-16_vision-pro/  
Currently, I am overlooking a lake at Mount Hood while writing this. I hear birds in the distance and see the lake calm, with subtle waves and some mist in the distance. Yet, it is fake, as I am sitting on our top floor, a barely furnished room full of items belonging to a family house with two young kids. I am using Apple's Vision Pro to explore what Spatial Computing can be. I am in awe; let me explain in this blog post.

**We ❤️ RSS**  
https://matthiasott.com/notes/we-love-rss  
In the last issue of Own Your Web, we looked at blogrolls as one way to improve the visibility and discoverability of our sites. Whether or not you want to add a blogroll to your site is a matter of personal preference. But there is something else which probably everyone with a personal website should do: adding an RSS feed.

**Finding a New Software Developer Job**  
https://henrikwarne.com/2024/02/11/finding-a-new-software-developer-job/  
For the first time ever, I was laid off, and had to find a new software developer job. I managed to find a new one, but it took longer than I thought, and it was a lot of work. I was in contact with 30 companies, got a no from 8 companies, no reply from 6 companies, and offers from 3 companies. Here is what I learnt from the process.

**The original WWW proposal is a Word for Macintosh 4.0 file from 1990, can we open it?**  
https://blog.jgc.org/2024/02/the-original-www-proposal-is-word-for.html  
The original document is 68,608 bytes and file on my Mac says it's a Microsoft Word for Macintosh 4.0 file. Microsoft Office for Mac came out in 1989 with System 6.0. That was Microsoft Word 4.0 so we're looking for compatibility with Microsoft Word for Macintosh 4.0. Let's see what modern software can open this. What I really want to be able to do is open it and convert it to, say, PDF with high fidelity.

**雨水节气，调肝胆，健脾胃，防湿邪**

雨水期间变化无常的天气，容易引起人们的情绪波动，乃至心神不安，影响人的身心健康，对高血压、心臟病、哮喘患者更是不利。人的肝气旺盛，怒气伤肝，需要禁忌暴怒，因而应当采取积极的修身养生方法，陶冶性情，保持情绪稳定，清心寡欲，不妄劳作，以养元炁。

**老子哲学与中华精神！**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/7g41rIzWOF0W5bpDcWy73w  
“从世界历史来看，老子的伟大是同中国的精神结合在一起的”，“虽然两位大师放眼于相反的方向，但他们实际上立足于同一基础之上”。这“同一基础”就是老子与孔子都主张在现世实现人生和社会的理想，他们对于现世都“保持着乐观的心境”。“在这一心境之中，人们既不知道佛教轮回给人构成的威胁……也没有认识到基督教的十字架……”他们共同开创和奠定了中国哲学的思想范式和基本倾向。

**竟然说针灸是“巫术”！他用209场演讲为它正名.....**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/IS84XXZ6ZsfM-X30FGbawQ  
或许大家也在疑惑，针灸到底能不能治病？真能止痛？如果能，为啥别人叫针灸是巫术？这位院士又是怎么向他们证明的？他是国际知名疼痛学家，曾独自一人远赴海外，用209场演讲证明针刺麻醉不是“巫术”；他在美国独面千人听证会，将中医针灸推向全世界……近日，总台《吾家吾国》专访我国疼痛医学开创者韩济生听他讲述与疼痛抗争的跋涉之旅。

**冯学成先生：心安为贵，身安为富**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/6ruebCLntj9u9UJyjmgMRQ  
一个人必须要确立自己的价值观念，优化自己的价值观念。观念在什么层次，基本上就决定了你是什么样的人。一般人看来升官发财就是富贵，升官则贵，发财则富。古代君子未必把权力、钱财当成富贵。周敦颐说：“君子以道充为贵，身安为富，故常泰无不足。”这句话到现在演变成“心安为贵，身安为富”。
