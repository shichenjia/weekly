Bun is a fast, all-in-one toolkit for running, building, testing, and debugging JavaScript and TypeScript, from a single script to a full-stack application. Bun 1.1 is huge update.

**The V8 Sandbox**  
https://v8.dev/blog/sandbox  
Chrome 123 could therefore be considered to be a sort of "beta" release for the sandbox. This blog post uses this opportunity to discuss the motivation behind the sandbox, show how it prevents memory corruption in V8 from spreading within the host process, and ultimately explain why it is a necessary step towards memory safety.

**The Design Philosophy of Great Tables**  
https://posit-dev.github.io/great-tables/blog/design-philosophy/  
Tables have come a long way and we’ve learned a lot from our continued research in tabular design. We hope to make the Great Tables package useful for your generation of summary tables. Given there’s ample room for innovation in this area, we’ll keep plugging away at doing that work to improve the API. We measure success by the quality of the tables the package is able to produce and we always keep that goal top of mind.

**Developers with AI assistants need to follow the pair programming model**  
https://stackoverflow.blog/2024/04/03/developers-with-ai-assistants-need-to-follow-the-pair-programming-model/  
In this article, we’ll discuss how and why pair programming is so effective, how you can treat your AI assistant as a paired programmer, and the best ways to make this pairing work (as well as the methods that don’t). Releated:

**HTTP/2 CONTINUATION Flood: Technical Details**  
https://nowotarski.info/http2-continuation-flood-technical-details/  
Deep technical analysis of the CONTINUATION Flood: a class of vulnerabilities within numerous HTTP/2 protocol implementations. In many cases, it poses a more severe threat compared to the Rapid Reset: a single machine (and in certain instances, a mere single TCP connection or a handful of frames) has the potential to disrupt server availability, with consequences ranging from server crashes to substantial performance degradation. Remarkably, requests that constitute an attack are not visible in HTTP access logs. A simplified security advisory and the list of affected projects can be found in: HTTP/2 CONTINUATION Flood.

**Cloud architecture will fail you. Distributed application architecture will not.**  
https://www.lightbend.com/blog/cloud-architecture-will-fail-you-distributed-app-architecture-will-not  
With a distributed application architecture, infrastructure capabilities are embedded within your microservices, and the developer's logic is bound to these capabilities creating an airtight abstraction. Each microservice is capable of self-healing and recovering from any hardware or network failure ensuring Shockproof Resilience. Microservices can move closer to end users, enabling a short round trip and the lowest latency. Further, each microservice consumes only the compute and memory needed to achieve this function.

**Scaling Safety and Civility on Roblox**  
https://blog.roblox.com/2024/04/scaling-safety-civility-roblox/  
Many of our safety features and tools are based on innovative AI solutions that run alongside an expert team of thousands who are dedicated to safety. This strategic blend of experienced humans and intelligent automation is imperative as we work to scale the volume of content we moderate 24/7. We also believe in nurturing partnerships with organizations focused on online safety, and, when relevant, we support legislation that we strongly believe will improve the industry as a whole. 

**Why you won't find a technical co-founder**  
https://www.breakneck.dev/blog/no-tech-cofounder  
Cut your list of requirements for a technical co-founder. Realize that you're essentially asking someone for a favour, until you have paying customers. Consider the costs, the opportunity costs and the risks of paying and not paying someone to get your idea off the ground. Don't expect your level of passion and your commitment level for your idea from someone else. Especially not after 2 meetings.

**在《孔子随喜》里发现中国式现代化的文化基因**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/qVoGjOX-9g-thBOISgiISA  
我们讲孔子的意思，不是说所有东西通通都要回到孔子的时代。我们吃饭跟他吃一样，我们也开始坐马车，那个不可能嘛！但是他背后有一个特别重要的精神——礼乐文明。今天要拿来平衡我们现代化的后遗症，乃至于给我们民族在现代化过程中作一个定海神针。

**直播回放：怎样实现健康端口前移？从我们如何预防感冒谈起**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/FpGJk1kU3A166NERGdiyoA  
大众学中医可能更关注于疾病，当然在疾病发生的时候我们也有招去应对，但因为你毕竟不是医生，现在有法律法规的限定，所以更重要的是要去学怎么才能让自己不生病……

**清明，养生宜生发养阳，疏肝健脾**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/66ErpXJiIFSOqqVNCPE3TQ  
清明节气在仲春与暮春之交，对于春季的养生，要顺应春天阳气生发、万物始生的特点，着眼于一个“生”字，同时春气通于肝，肝气旺于春季，肝木克脾土，升发太过或气机阻滞，均可引起消化系统疾患。所以清明是一个重要的养生节气。清明节气以疏肝、健脾、护阳为养生之道。

**心存孝义自感天**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/lArzhT_P4ZSEalr_x-4pdQ  
“孝”是我们民族的传统美德，它绝不仅仅只是美德而已，它更应该是我们全社会的一种责任。

**南华祖师说要“心斋”，我们的心如何去做“吃素”的工作呢？**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/RfyUJKeJOB-S4-5rLA1YwA  
一个真正的合道者，是可以做到心斋的。颜回追问什么叫心斋，孔子回答说：“若一志，无听之以耳而听之以心；无听之以心而听之以气。听止于耳，心止于符。气也者，虚而待物者也。唯道集虚。虚者，心斋也。”
