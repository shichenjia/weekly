https://www.citationneeded.news/we-can-have-a-different-web/  
Many yearn for the “good old days” of the web. We could have those good old days back — or something even better — and if anything, it would be easier now than it ever was.

**在这群微信人身上，我发现一个共性**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/0vLIilR8I_2ChuLJY3vxGA  
微信G有刚入职的新同学，在学着如何更精准地发现产品的问题；有资历颇深的中生代，在想着如何迭代研发效能工具，更贴合一线业务需求；有工作十几年的“老鹅”，不断打破边界一起让产品做得更好；还有团队的管理者，想要传递自己曾得到的信任，为团队成员营造更多的发挥空间…… 走进会发现，在这群人各式各样的探索背后，都凝聚着一个关键词：自驱。

**I Reviewed 1,000s of Opinions on HTMX**  
https://konfigthis.com/blog/htmx/  
https://dbushell.com/2024/04/16/htmx-and-modern-javascript/  
To analyze how developers truly feel about HTMX, I went to where developers live: Reddit, Twitter, Hacker News, and YouTube. I parsed 1,000s of discussions and synthesized my findings in this article, striving to present only thought-provoking opinions.

**An alternative proposal for CSS masonry**  
https://developer.chrome.com/blog/masonry?hl=en  
The Chrome team is keen to see an implementation of masonry type layouts on the web. However, we feel that implementing it as part of the CSS Grid specification as proposed in the recent WebKit post would be a mistake. We also feel that the WebKit post argued against a version of masonry that no one was proposing. Therefore, this post aims to explain why we at Chrome have concerns about implementing masonry as part of the CSS Grid Layout specification, and clarify exactly what the alternate proposal enables. 

**React, Electron, and LLMs have a common purpose: the labour arbitrage theory of dev tool popularity**  
https://www.baldurbjarnason.com/2024/react-electron-llms-labour-arbitrage/  
My theory is fairly straightforward: The long-term popularity of any given tool for software development is proportional to how much labour arbitrage it enables. The more effective it is at enabling labour arbitrage, the more funding and adoption it gets from management.

**Knowledge Graphs - What Are They?**  
https://blog.scottlogic.com/2024/05/01/knowledge-graphs-what-are-they.html  
In this blog post I’ll give my impressions having looked into these data stores. I’ll go over the basics of what a knowledge graph is, and discuss how and why graph databases can be useful compared to more traditional relational databases. Hopefully this can serve as a useful springboard for anyone else interested in learning the basics.

**Upcoming research at Stack Overflow**

All about the research that the User Experience team will be focused on over the next quarter and how you can help.

**Managing Your Facility and Tools to Automate the Process**  
https://a16z.com/managing-your-facility-and-tools-to-automate-the-process/  
For this article, we interviewed multiple lenders to glean their guidance and insights. We also sought the advice of several software providers who work with fintech borrowers to get their best approaches to managing one or more debt facilities. Armed with these considerations and guidance around invaluable tools — many often not mentioned as part of the debt raise process — you’ll hopefully stay on top of all your contractually required reporting, tracking, and much more.

很多人追求坐在那里要不起念头，其实大家都做不到。因为一念不生就变成木头、石头了。可以有任何的思绪，但不被思绪带着走，“来者不拒，去者不留”。就像看风景，你是带着欢喜心鸟瞰一切，到处都有美景，但你不会执着于某一处。

**傅佩荣：论语出现20次的一个字，人生必须面对的一件事，说得太透彻了**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/Vga3vCead5M3Oh56Y4r1Mg  
整部《论语》里面，“怨”字出现了二十次，是所有描写情绪的语词中，出现比例最高的。可见“怨”这种情绪，是大多数人生活中都要面对的。人与人交往原本是自然的，但这种互动难免带来比较；一旦互相比较，心中就会出现各种不平的现象，“怨”就产生了。如何化解怨怼？孔子给出的建议值得好好了解一番。

**万金难买的人生檄文**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/C1IRw79n5A4qcuC2LntlrQ  
浮躁、迷惘、空虚、忧郁，是现代人的通病。在当今时代，人们有时更看重的是对功名利禄和荣华富贵的追求，而忽略了对自己身心健康的培植，所以精神显得极度匮乏，总是埋怨生活的无聊与苦涩。如果你能在百忙之中抽出时间去静心读一些书，可能会让你的生活更加欢乐与充实，让你领略美好生活的另一面。

**没有一代年轻人会垮掉**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/mnafON17Cr1FeniaoxE6Ag  
回望历史，青年人从不缺席国家民族发展的关键时刻，往后的他们也不可能缺席，一代代青年，都会以一浪又一浪思想、一根又一根脊梁，撑起属于他们的“当下”。
