**新年，重新校准我们对万事万物的看法，不再失衡**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/lGFksPU9LPxMrToFHL2xiQ  
由于看世界的角度不同了，那些曾在我们眼里行为古怪的人也变得不再那么奇怪。当我们重新恢复了平衡，才意识到是我们自己扭曲了我们的关系、观点和行为。站得越直，我们身体里的经气能量越正常、越强壮。对于世界的看法就越真实，我们就会越包容。因为我们终于可以接受这个世界的复杂多样性。我们越失衡，对于世界的看法就越是非黑即白；当洞察力越来越深时，我们才可能看到更多的灰色。

**业务软件生产过程的未来**  
https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/676642636  
最近几个月，跟不同的人有过一些交流，得到了不少收获，也产生了一些认知，简单记录下要点。前一两年，深入参与了一次中型以上规模的业务软件研发过程，从零起步做一个供应链采购的系统，业务非常有意思，也有代表性，但交付过程是一言难尽的，抛开因为时效、预期、领域认知等存在的问题，纯从研发体系角度，产生了一些思考点。

**怎样花两年时间去面试一个人**  
https://mindhacks.cn/2011/11/04/how-to-interview-a-person-for-two-years/  
没有哪个行业像IT行业这样，无形资产占据公司的绝大多数资产。拒坊间传言比尔·盖茨就曾经说过类似这样的话：只要允许我带走100个人我可以再造一个微软。这话没搜到原版出处，但是从一个侧面反映了IT公司当中智力资产所占的比例之重。所以一个自然的推论就是，招聘也许是一个公司决策当中最最重要的一个环节。Joel Spolsky把他在这方面的观察，体会和洞见集结成了一本小册子《Smart and Gets Things Done》，开篇就挑战“产品是公司成败的关键”这个传统观念，他认为创造最适合工程师生活的环境，留下最优秀的人才才是最先最重要的一步，接下来好的产品是水到渠成的事情。

**Is htmx Just Another JavaScript Framework?**  
https://htmx.org/essays/is-htmx-another-javascript-framework/  
In short, while htmx can be used as a framework, it’s a framework that deviates far less from the web’s semantics than the JavaScript frameworks do, and will benefit from improvements in those semantics with no additional work from the user, thanks to the web’s excellent backwards compatibility guarantees. If you want to build a website that lasts for a long time, these qualities make htmx a substantially better bet than many of its contemporaries.

**Frontend predictions for 2024**  
https://buttondown.email/whatever_jamie/archive/frontend-predictions-for-2024/  
Jamie dressed up as a fortune teller, gazing into a crystal ball with astonishment
It's been a remarkable year for frontend. We've seen a gold rush to capture – and invent – the server-side rendering (SSR) market; the advancing tentacles of AI; a Cambrian explosion of web renderers and JS engines; a formidable line of hopefuls attempting to unseat the big names from their pedestals; and movements on various other fronts. So before the traditional soothsaying of the year to come, let's review the hotchpotch this year has been so far.

**When "Everything" Becomes Too Much: The npm Package Chaos of 2024**  
https://socket.dev/blog/when-everything-becomes-too-much  
An NPM user named PatrickJS launched a troll campaign with a package called "everything," which depends on all public npm packages.

**The Eight Golden Rules of Interface Design**  
https://www.cs.umd.edu/~ben/goldenrules.html  
I have often been asked to distill the vast corpus of user interface design into a few key principles. While I was reluctant to do this, it turned out to be a good exercise to write “Golden Rules,” that are applicable in most interactive systems. These principles, derived from experience and refined over three decades, require validation and tuning for specific design domains. No list such as this can be complete, but even the original list from 1985, has been well received as a useful guide to students and designers.

**The world's smallest PNG**  
https://evanhahn.com/worlds-smallest-png/  
The smallest PNG file is 67 bytes. It’s a single black pixel. There’s a big twist at the end, if that excites you. But I hope you’re just excited to learn about PNGs.

**Interdependencies in your system of work, and how not to evaluate software practices**  
https://sollecitom.github.io/software-product-development-blog/posts/2024/2024-01-10-interdependencies-in-your-system-of-work/  
I hear of people saying their team tried Trunk-Based Development, and decided they didn’t find it beneficial after a couple of months. I’m not going to war about the benefits of Trunk-Based Development today, even if I do love this practice. Instead, I want to discuss the fact that this kind of statement is problematic. You see, Trunk-Based Development is a practice, and therefore it’s part of a system of work. The performance of a system depends on how the parts interact, not on how the parts perform separately.

**Convert the kernel to C++**  
https://new.qq.com/rain/a/20240111A0794200  
https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/3465e0c6-f5b2-4c42-95eb-29361481f805@zytor.com/  
Both C and C++ has had a lot of development since 1999, and C++ has in fact, in my personal opinion, finally "grown up" to be a better C for the kind of embedded programming that an OS kernel epitomizes. I'm saying that as the author of a very large number of macro and inline assembly hacks in the kernel. What really makes me say that is that a lot of things we have recently asked for gcc-specific extensions are in fact relatively easy to implement in standard C++ and, in many cases, allows for infrastructure improvement without global code changes.

**Between Art and Algorithms**  
https://alexkondov.com/between-writing-and-programming/  
To many people logic and art are the two distant ends of the creativity line where you have to pick one or the other. To me, they are both sides of a circle and they lead to the same spot of absolute craftsmanship. The greatest engineering marvels are a work of art, and the best paintings and poems have more logic than you’d imagine. Programming and writing, are two sides of the same coin.

**The Story Continues: Announcing Version 14 of Wolfram Language and Mathematica**  
https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2024/01/the-story-continues-announcing-version-14-of-wolfram-language-and-mathematica/  
Building Something Greater and Greater… for 35 Years and Counting. Today we celebrate a new waypoint on our journey of nearly four decades with the release of Version 14.0 of Wolfram Language and Mathematica. Over the two years since we released Version 13.0 we’ve been steadily delivering the fruits of our research and development in .1 releases every six months. Today we’re aggregating these—and more—into Version 14.0.

**I quit my job to work full time on my open source project**

Atuin supercharges your productivity by enabling you to rapidly retrieve any command you’ve ran, at any time, from anywhere. It stores your shell history in a database, recording additional command context and syncing it (e2e encrypted) across devices. The 22nd of December was my last day leading the infrastructure team at PostHog. Going forwards, I’m starting a company and working full time on Atuin.

平静是奢侈品，但我们比过往任何时候更需要它。应对压力，缓解焦虑，思考出路，发现灵感，都应以平静作为第一步。平静不仅是起点，是过程，也是人生的目的。平静既是一种心态，还是一种方法，一种策略，一种哲学。
