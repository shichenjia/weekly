**Taking Back the Web with Decentralization: 2023 in Review**  
https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2023/12/taking-back-web-decentralization-2023-review  
When a system becomes too tightly-controlled and centralized, the people being squeezed tend to push back to reclaim their lost autonomy. The internet is no exception. While the internet began as a loose affiliation of universities and government bodies, that emergent digital commons has been increasingly privatized and consolidated into a handful of walled gardens. Their names are too often made synonymous with the internet, as they fight for the data and eyeballs of their users.

在我们日常工作中，要实现需求的快速和高质量交付，关键在于提升效率和质量。然而，在实践中很难找到一个通用策略，能同时针对效率和质量进行优化。这是因为在不同的场景下，对效率和质量会产生不同的解读。例如，在需求研发阶段，研发团队可能更注重提升工程效率和代码质量；而测试团队可能会更关注平台的稳定性和需求的质量；产品团队则可能聚焦于缩短交付周期和提高资源的有效使用。

React is a UI programming paradigm that lets me break down what to display (a blog post, a signup form, or even a whole app) into independent pieces called components, and compose them like LEGO blocks. I’ll assume you already know and like components; check react.dev for an intro. Components are code, and that code has to run somewhere. But wait—whose computer should they run on? Should they run on your computer? Or on mine? Releated:
