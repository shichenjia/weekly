**40 years of programming**  
https://liw.fi/40/  
This essay discusses some of the things I've learned about how to successfully build software. These are things I've learned from my own experience; I'm not a researcher, and there are few references to sources, and this is largely not supported by evidence. I'm basing this essay on my own experience, and if you disagree, that's fine. My goal in this essay is to get the reader to think, to research, to learn, to ponder. My goal is not to tell the reader how to think, what to think, how things are, or to give the answer to every question about every aspect of the process of building software.

**The “10x engineer:" 50 years ago and now**  
https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/the-10x-engineer-evolution/  
You see where this leads. “10x developer” behavior can actually be undetected toxic behavior under a different label. Meanwhile, others could have the advantage of a specific context that cannot be replicated. It’s certainly a complex topic, and one we haven’t stopped thinking and arguing about for more than 50 years, across the industry.

**Measuring Developer Productivity via Humans**  
https://martinfowler.com/articles/measuring-developer-productivity-humans.html  
Measuring developer productivity is a difficult challenge. Conventional metrics focused on development cycle time and throughput are limited, and there aren't obvious answers for where else to turn. Qualitative metrics offer a powerful way to measure and understand developer productivity using data derived from developers themselves. Organizations should prioritize measuring developer productivity using data from humans, rather than data from systems.

**How web bloat impacts users with slow devices**  
https://danluu.com/slow-device/  
In 2017, we looked at how web bloat affects users with slow connections. Even in the U.S., many users didn't have broadband speeds, making much of the web difficult to use. It's still the case that many users don't have broadband speeds, both inside and outside of the U.S. and that much of the modern web isn't usable for people with slow internet, but the exponential increase in bandwidth (Nielsen suggests this is 50% per year for high-end connections) has outpaced web bloat for typical sites, making this less of a problem than it was in 2017, although it's still a serious problem for people with poor connections.

**A generalist AI agent for 3D virtual environments**

We present new research on a Scalable Instructable Multiworld Agent (SIMA) that can follow natural-language instructions to carry out tasks in a variety of video game settings. Releated:

**CHAOS: Yelp's Unified Framework for Server-Driven UI**  
https://engineeringblog.yelp.com/2024/03/chaos-yelps-unified-framework-for-server-driven-ui.html  
Yelp develops two major applications, Yelp & Yelp for Business, for Web (Desktop & Mobile), iOS, and Android platforms. That’s eight unique clients! Keeping a fresh, consistent UI on all these clients is a major challenge. Server-driven UI (SDUI) has become a standard industry technique for managing UI on multiple platforms. 

**I’m So Old: Web Edition**  
https://davidwalsh.name/im-so-old-1  
Time can be a funny thing. I still remember discovering HTML, CSS, and JavaScript coding. I still remember my first college programming course. I still remember my first day at my first coding job, then my first day at my second coding job, and then my first day at Mozilla. I still remember my first day coding for MetaMask. This year marks my 20th year as a professional software engineer and it's happened in the blink of an eye.

**The Future of AR and Remote Work**  
https://calebschoepp.com/blog/2024/the-future-of-ar-and-remote-work/  
Once again AR might just have the answers to our problems. Once AR is good enough to trick me into thinking that I’m physically with my coworkers, then I may as well not be remote. The camaraderie will naturally follow.

**S3 is files, but not a filesystem**  
https://calpaterson.com/s3.html  
I think the idea that S3 is really "Amazon Cloud Filesystem" is a bit of a load bearing fiction. It's sort of true: S3 can store files. It's also a very useful belief in getting people to adopt S3, a fundamentally good technology, which otherwise they might not. But it's false: S3 is not a filesystem and can't stand in for one.

**你患上“淡淡综合征”了吗**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/8h7nLumjDrVvnNYQ9_6ADQ  
“淡淡综合征”不是一个医学术语，而是描述在部分当代年轻人中较为常见的一种状态。互联网上有人这样形容：现在全网最流行的时尚单品和社交面具，是“淡淡的”；大家争相认领的人设或者说努力想成为的样子，是“淡人”。

**感悟“中”医**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/HFe4XCXHnoanH0p4iLYZdQ  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/O08fcDjtseSZANyyi1hzMA  
中医的“中”，是不断趋向完善的动态平衡，是中道的思维模式，是天人合一的生活方式。

**所谓的“抑郁症”，很多时候是整个身体能量不够了！**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/TC1wim93RqlODlGEB5Sk4Q  
当一个人能量很低的时候，他的身体状态会很低，他的内心状态、意识状态也会很低。在中医眼里，去具体分析抑郁症有多少型、抑郁症的诊断标准，是没有太多意义的。更重要的是——所谓心理问题的背后，有着怎样的深意？

**盖老师 | 让生命发挥更大的潜能**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/hR_lFBlkpt0MhNQ1iMb6Jg  
我之前有西医的背景——精神科的护士，因为有这个背景，所以我认为五行针灸是个非常体系化的治疗方法，能够让我真正参与到病人的疗愈当中。实际上，我只是在帮助病人通过他自愈的能力回到应有的轨道上，并帮助他发挥最大的潜能。

**新质生产力要让工程师文化重新变为时尚**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/JymsKMKbmFEnWyM1rkG0lQ  
随着全国两会的召开，“新质生产力”已经成为了引起中国各界人士讨论的互联网热词。这个基于快速变化的现实问题被提出的重要概念，意在摆脱传统经济增长方式、生产力发展路径，以科技创新为主，用新技术改造提升传统产业，积极促进产业高端化、智能化、数字化、绿色化。
