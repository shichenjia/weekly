**Notes on Distributed Systems for Young Bloods**  
https://www.somethingsimilar.com/2013/01/14/notes-on-distributed-systems-for-young-bloods/  
Below is a list of some lessons I’ve learned as a distributed systems engineer that are worth being told to a new engineer. Some are subtle, and some are surprising, but none are controversial. This list is for the new distributed systems engineer to guide their thinking about the field they are taking on. It’s not comprehensive, but it’s a good beginning.

**The secret inside One Million Checkboxes**  
https://eieio.games/essays/the-secret-in-one-million-checkboxes/  
A few days into making One Million Checkboxes I thought I’d been hacked. What was that doing in my database? A few hours later I was tearing up, proud of some brilliant teens.

**The Art of Finishing**  
https://www.bytedrum.com/posts/art-of-finishing/  
Understanding both the allure of endless projects and the cost of never finishing is crucial. It’s not about dismissing the excitement of new beginnings, but rather about finding a balance — learning to channel that initial enthusiasm into the equally important (if sometimes less glamorous) work of seeing things through to completion. By recognizing these patterns in ourselves, we can start to develop strategies to overcome them and finally slay the Project Hydra.

**The hidden cost of speed**  
https://stackoverflow.blog/2024/09/05/the-hidden-cost-of-speed/  
It’s tempting to push projects out the door, to woo and impress colleagues and supervisors, but the stark truth is that even the smallest projects should have proper review periods.

**IndieWeb vs indie web**  
https://fyr.io/post/indieweb_vs_indie_web  
The IndieWeb, as it stands, is a bit... perhaps elitist is the wrong word. It's a club for those that can, and although part of the IndieWeb's broader message is about eschewing the commercial web and owning your stuff, unless you know at least a little bit about websites and how they work, you're gonna be relying on commercial organisations to get you going and keep you rolling in the IndieWeb.

**Every webpage deserves to be a place**  
https://interconnected.org/home/2024/09/05/cursor-party  
If you’ve visited my actual website, rather than reading by email or whatever, such as reading this very post, you may notice somebody else’s cursor pass by as you’re reading. So that’s a feature I’ve added, part of something called cursor party. I’ve blurred other people’s cursors as if you’re seeing them through frosted glass.

**The Ultimate Guide to Font Performance Optimization**  
https://www.debugbear.com/blog/website-font-performance  
Font performance optimization is a set of web development techniques that make fonts load faster and render more smoothly. They involve practices such as thoughtful font selection, the use of performant font formats, self-hosting, optimized @font-face declarations, font display strategies, and more.  

**Lazy loading isn't just lazy, it's late: the web deserves faster.**  
https://www.differentshelf.com/lazy-loading-isnt-just-lazy-its-late-the-web-deserves-faster/  
A manifesto for proactive loading in Angular and other SPAs and why lazy-loading isn't just lazy: it's late. The web deserves faster.

**刘力红：如何从压力中解放出来？**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/y_BtZExpiJcB14rDWKz1uw  
要从压力上解放出来，我想只有一条，就是要学会放下。这个放下不是要各位不做事情了，辞职了，不是这样。事情照做，项目照接，生意照样红火，但是从内心要放下，从内心不要去执着，不要去担忧，这个叫放下。我在这里引了成都文殊院的一副对联的上联，可能有的同志到过成都，也到过文殊院，也见过这副对联。这副对联很有名，上联叫做：见了便做，做了便放下，了了有何不了。

**蔡志忠：你无法得到真理，只能融入真理**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/VAflSJwDK4eFFsit_okPhw  
你无法得到真理，你只能融入真理。真理藏于微妙的本质里，虽然看不见，但它却真真切切存在着。就像盐溶于水中。从里面看不见，从表面也看不见，你只能体会、实践。

**生活需要“量化”吗**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/CXZjvwZFIXZNq4FQB72_9g  
其实我们大可不必执着于追求数据上的“完美无瑕”和世俗层面的意义感，那反而可能消解生活本身的意义。生活在大数据的冲刷之下，愿每个手握终端的人都在“量化生活”中找到平衡。量化的是效率，而非生活，我们的生命中除了数据、代码，还有天地、山水、星辰。

**一个中医学子看完《四圣心源》后的深度启发(附倪师讲解自学中医思路)**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/Lw_uJ8kkZaUaUl02D3iBYw  
《中医基础理论》课本啃了好多遍，但依然觉得有点意不尽、嚼不烂、理不透，而随意翻翻所发现的《四圣心源》里的方和对于方通俗易懂的解释深深吸引着我，看着一个个像个太极一样解释的方解，那么有趣，我想，它应该可以给我一些提示吧？带着疑惑和小小激动的心情，坐下，阅读。

**很“秃”然？为什么一到秋天就特别容易掉头发？**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/iG8y32tvMaPopBqb2xEy5Q  
广大网友们戏谑：度过了炎热的夏天，却迎来了脱发的秋天。自己的头发就像是树上的落叶，掉的哪哪儿都是。各种头发护理、护法精油、防脱发洗发水用上，一顿猛如虎的操作后，发现好像并没什么效果。学堂有一句话：结构不对，努力白费。今天，我们就来聊聊关于掉头发这件事。除了传统内科气血的角度，也看看在学堂结构医学的视角下，有哪些可以改善的方法。

**悟｜站满一百八十天**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/K54fLLFq_p0Aem7C1ZRzkA  
2023年8月就接触站桩了 但一直断断续续没当回事儿 许是缘份没到
今年想着自己那么多的坚持都坚持下来了 站桩应该也没问题吧
那么 立个flag吧 正好园区也有几个小伙伴一起站 一起可以走更远
再挑个好日子吧 刚好闰年 2月29日开站 每天站30分钟
