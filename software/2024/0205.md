**The perfect three-way: data, models and AI**  
https://modeling-languages.com/data-models-and-ai/  
Data and data models are back in fashion thanks to the AI fever. But this also means that classical problems like data annotation, data mining, data fusion, data composition, etc., now in an ML context, must be revisited. For instance, ML often relies on big data sources that seem to be schemaless. But this is not really true. At most, we can say it is  “less-schema” than other data, and we may need to first infer the implicit schema behind that data to be able to interpret it.

**The web just gets better with Interop 2024**  
https://hacks.mozilla.org/2024/02/announcing-interop-2024/  
https://webkit.org/blog/14955/the-web-just-gets-better-with-interop/  
The web is amazing. It makes collaborating, learning, and connecting easy for billions of people, because it’s intentionally designed to run on radically different devices. Releated: [Celebrate a more interoperable web with Interop 2023](https://web.dev/blog/interop-2023-wrapup?hl=en.

**Deno in 2023**  
https://deno.com/blog/deno-in-2023  
In 2023, Deno shifted into high gear with respect to Node/npm compatibility and performance work, while continuing to move towards our goal of radically simplifying web development. Here’s a summary of what changed in 2023.

**The State of Dapps on IPFS: Trust vs. Verification**  
https://blog.ipfs.tech/dapps-ipfs/  
This blog post provides a comprehensive overview of the current landscape of dapps on IPFS through the lens of trust and verifiability. Given the nuance and breadth of this topic, this blog post is rather long.

**Work hard and take everything really seriously**  
https://macwright.com/2024/01/28/work-hard-and-take-everything-seriously.html  
So, heed the warnings of those 30-somethings about burnout and workplace boundaries. And don’t work 24/7 on busywork for a startup if you’re not learning anything. You can burn out by going too fast, or your flame can dim because you don’t let yourself spend silly amounts of time on silly projects to satisfy your intellectual curiosity. Beware of both outcomes: cultivate your enthusiasm for the things you want to hang onto.

**CSS Blurry Shimmer Effect**  
https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2024/01/css-blurry-shimmer-effect/  
Box shadows are fairly straightforward in CSS: declare the box-shadow property, set the shadow offsets, define the spread, and give it a color. It’s a great way to add depth to what might be an otherwise flat design! Taking inspiration from shadows, author Yair Even Or creates the same sort of thing, only with a blurring effect in place of the shadow. Read along for a step-by-step explanation of how it comes together using a combination of masks, gradients, and the good ol’ backdrop-filter property.

**HTML Web Components on the Server Are Great**  
https://scottjehl.com//posts/composition/  
In this post, I want to talk about some tools that enable HTML Web Component patterns to work on the server-side, making it easier to use them at scale in sites and apps of all kinds.

**Going from "it works" to "it looks nice" with your code**  
https://gomakethings.com/going-from-it-works-to-it-looks-nice-with-your-code/  
Junior and early-career developers tend to write code that works but is a little less well structured. They repeat themselves a bit, or hard-code things that could be abstracted for easier reuse. As they transition to mid-level developers, I find that code tends to get almost over-engineered. There’s a tendency to over-compensate for the spaghetti code of your early career by throwing lots of coding paradigms at it.

**I am a creative.**  
https://alistapart.com/article/i-am-a-creative/  
I am a creative. What I do is alchemy. It is a mystery. I do not so much do it, as let it be done through me.

**Why 2023 Was AI Video’s Breakout Year, and What to Expect in 2024**  
https://a16z.com/why-2023-was-ai-videos-breakout-year-and-what-to-expect-in-2024/  
However, the progress we’ve seen in video generation over the past year suggests that we’re in the early innings of a massive transformation — similar to what we saw in image generation. We’re seeing continued improvements in text-to-video models, as well as offshoots like image-to-video and video-to-video gaining steam. Releated:

中医学在官方的衰落是中华传统文化整体衰落的副产物，任何人都不应该，也不配去承担这个责任。而中医学并不会因此而绝灭，恰恰相反，中医学永远具有无比旺盛的生命力，而这种生命力他在于民间。

https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/KnAW6mM-1AWjUYycaYAXYw  
每当我对某一行有新的洞察，或者像近期开始对两行关系有更深的感悟时，都会让我心生欢喜。我将自己视作这些启发的源泉，但我不确定其他五行针灸师在多大程度上用我这样的方式来研究五行。毕竟，这可能只是君火的特点之一——在试图更清醒地面对这个世界时，君火总会不断地探寻自己与周围人、事的反应，就像我一直做的那样。

**“千万工程”何以在世界“圈粉”**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/6iox_O1YHsHdk0ozWM7rnA  
千头万绪的事，说到底是千家万户的事。“千万工程”从解决群众反映强烈的环境脏乱差问题做起，正是对“以人民为中心”的生动实践，也因此才得以持之以恒，从而不断实现人民对美好生活的向往。
