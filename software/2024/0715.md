**Ethical Web Principles**  
https://www.w3.org/TR/ethical-web-principles/  
https://gomakethings.com/principles-for-the-web/  
The web should be a platform that helps people and provides a positive social benefit. As we continue to evolve the web platform, we must therefore consider the consequences of our work. The following document sets out ethical principles that will drive the W3C's continuing work in this direction.

**Happy people make better products**  
https://stackoverflow.blog/2024/07/02/happy-people-make-better-products/  
The home team welcomes developer and software consultant Ben Borra to the show for a wide-ranging conversation about developer productivity, the value of positive feedback and identifying quick wins, the impact of code assistants on devs’ everyday work, and the challenges of system rewrites.

**Speeding up the JavaScript ecosystem - Isolated Declarations**  
https://marvinh.dev/blog/speeding-up-javascript-ecosystem-part-10/  
TypeScript's new isolated declaration feature is a game changer for sharing code among developers. It significantly simplifies the process of packaging your code for consumption whilst reducing the time to create type definition files from minutes, sometimes even hours, down to less than a second.

**Microservices rules: what good looks like**  
https://microservices.io//post/architecture/2024/07/10/microservices-rules-what-good-looks-like.html  
I gave this presentation at a company’s internal meetup. It’s the latest version of my Microservices Rules talk. These 11 rules are a great checklist that engineering leaders can use to assess the state of their organization, its delivery practices and its application’s architecture.

**Pop Culture**  
https://www.wheresyoured.at/pop-culture/  
For Goldman to suddenly turn on the AI movement suggests that it’s extremely anxious about the future of generative AI, with almost everybody agreeing on one core point: that the longer this tech takes to make people money, the more money it's going to need to make. Releated:

**Behind the scenes of Web Awesome theming**  
https://blog.fontawesome.com/web-awesome-theming/  
Your website’s look and feel sets it apart from everything else. It can be a real challenge to set up that theme so it’s easy to change and reuse later. But what about opening the doors for anyone to come along and restyle it at will? That’s the magic we set out to create with Web Awesome theming.

**React Summit 2024: Why Use Redux Today?**  
https://blog.isquaredsoftware.com/2024/07/presentations-why-use-redux/  
I had the chance to speak at both React Connection Paris in April and React Summit Amsterdam in June, and at both conferences I gave a talk on "Why Use Redux Today?".Both of those had the same core content, but I tweaked and updated the slides for React Summit.

**The Magic of Clip Path**  
https://emilkowal.ski/ui/the-magic-of-clip-path  
clip-path is often used for trimming a DOM node into specific shapes, like triangles. But what if I told you that it's also great for animations? In this article, we'll dive into clip-path and explore some of the cool things you can do with it. Once you read it, you'll start seeing this CSS property being used everywhere.

**Recreating the THX "Deep Note" in JavaScript**  
https://keliris.dev/articles/deep-note  
In this blog post, I’ll share how I recreated the iconic THX “Deep Note” using JavaScript and the Tone.js library.

**Learn Suspense by Building a Suspense-Enabled Library**  
https://www.bbss.dev/posts/react-learn-suspense/  
Suspense (along with concurrent rendering) has been a feature in React since v16.6.0. Despite this, I haven’t seen much of it in action beyond React.lazy and limited applications of “suspense-enabled libraries”. What’s going on? 

**The Best Things About Working in UX**  
https://www.nngroup.com/articles/best-things-about-working-in-ux/  
Summary:  We surveyed 126 practitioners, uncovering 8 things practitioners love about working in UX, from problem-solving to accessible design.

**How I sent 500 million HTTP requests to 2.5 million hosts**  
https://www.moczadlo.com/2024/how-i-sent-500-million-http-requests-in-under-24h  
Yes, I tried implementing it in Rust, but unfortunately, my brain is too small for async tokio types magic. Go, on the other hand, allowed the JS developer to write this whole thing, this is quite a statement about the language.

**Engineering Principles for Building Financial Systems**

Best practices and principles to create accurate and reliable software based financial systems.

**The Product Model in Traditional IT**  
https://www.svpg.com/the-product-model-in-traditional-it/  
So the product model is from product organizations, and for product organizations. However, since the book has been out, we have had a number of inquiries asking if we think the product model applies to other types of organizations that also build, but are not typical product organizations? So far, we have had inquiries from three other types of organizations: the first is from Traditional IT departments, and that’s what we’ll discuss here.

各位大陆的同胞们，希望大家能够喜欢中医文化，我自己能力有限，救不了那么多人，希望大家都能自主学习，如果每个同胞都能自发地学习和探索中医文化，我相信传统中医很快就能复兴。由我来教你的话，你不用花那么多年啊。从我上面开始，你不是生了很多力，那将来你肯定比我强的啊。我教了大家就是，我唯一的目的就是希望你，能够，我看不到的人，结果你看到了，你能够把他给救回来。

**刘力红：我们为什么要办三和生命学堂**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/Gpkz0jwnhS3B3B31H13l_g  
从我们这几十年的临床经验看，普遍来讲光靠看病想获得健康，实际上是很困难的。所谓“三分治，七分养”，养须重于治，这于健康的话题而言，是根本性的原则。所谓养，并非仅限于多吃点什么，少干点什么，而在于对我们的生命有一个基本的认识。根据这个基本认识，尽量多做对生命有益的事，少做对生命有损的事。所以只有建立了这个认识，把握住了这个损益，这个养才具有根本的意义，才能真正为健康保驾护航。

**中医养生缘何“圈粉”Z世代**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/9D19zxTWZS_z2rSPW0X5vw  
想要通过中医积极改善健康状况固然是好事，但追逐一时的养生潮流很可能改变不了什么。改善健康状况是一场持久战，离不开长期践行的养生观念与良好规律的生活习惯。同时，再好的养生良方也勿短期内应用过度，以免得不偿失，造成新的问题。这样才符合中医的“中和”原则。

**悲闻，姚梅龄教授已逝。一生所系 只为救人**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/tu9WaRz0b_p_LasW0VEs0w  
《临证脉学十六讲》是他的重要著作之一，详细记录了常见而易于误诊的脉象，为临床医生提供了宝贵的诊断和治疗指南。这本书不仅在学术上具有高度的准确性和严谨性，还蕴含了姚教授及其家族三代医家的临床智慧和传承精神。姚教授不仅在文字著述上有着严谨的追求，他还通过丰富的教学视频和音频，将自己的医学见解和临床技艺传播给无数学生和医者。他的教学内容，如《症状鉴别诊断学》和《伤寒证候学》，不仅在学术上深受推崇，更在临床实践中指导了许多医疗工作者的实际操作。

**赵前林 | 处理日常感冒、发烧时的临证思路**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/yO1Zs0_6s62WrZH4cBUAqA  
“我的孩子为什么总感冒？” “为什么吃了退烧药，烧还是退不下来？” “烧退下来了，怎么还久咳不断？” “是不是发烧就一定要喝热水、捂被子出汗？” 临证思维要求我们“先看人，再看病”。不同体质的人面对外感病邪，处理思路也会有所不同。本场讲座中，前林老师首先讲解了如何评估自己的三焦能量格局，在整体把握自己的能量水平以后，还为我们分享了不同类型外感的处理原则。

**五行落在地球上**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/wEDtWiytDAlRxkrmqxPnNA  
五行针灸做的就是扶持虚弱的“主导一行”，通过穴位让“天地人”不再分裂，让不平衡的个体——“人”融入平衡的宇宙中，让人“形与神俱”，回归本来。
