In this article, we hope to do the same by describing how the product model manifests at Amazon.  My co-author in this case is the European-based transformation coach Richard Russell.  Richard had a long career leading product and engineering, first at Google and later at Amazon, and now he helps other companies in their efforts to move to the product model.

**Diving into the Node.js Website Redesign**  
https://nodejs.org/en/blog/announcements/diving-into-the-nodejs-website-redesign  
We've taken great care in approaching this design with a nod to the past and look to the future. The site has many converging use cases, thousands of pages, and is a daily resource to many. The whole story had some dead ends and detours. But in the end it was a collective effort; coming to life with the contributions of over three dozen contributors and fantastic teamwork with select partners. 

**Two open source projects with great documentation**  
https://johnjago.com/great-docs/  
esbuild and Redis1 are two examples of codebases with exceptional documentation. Through their READMEs, changelogs, architecture documents, and code comments, both projects explain their design in such a way that someone new to the codebase can understand where things are, how things are done, and why they are done that way. If you’re a developer looking to get better at documenting your code and software architecture, these are great case studies.

身为中国人真的是一件幸运的事。因为我们有深厚的文化基础，可以回溯传统，从中获得心灵上的帮助。最为典型的代表，就是庄子。为什么我说，庄子能给现代人很多心灵上的帮助？因为庄子面对的生活境况，和我们今天有相似之处，就是：一片虚无。
