**A vision for Web 5**  
https://sollecitom.github.io/software-product-development-blog/posts/2024/2024-01-19-a-vision-for-web-5/  
So let’s assume we finally got tired of NFTs, AI, unicorns, and mini-ponies with Web 4, and we somehow decided to actually try and improve things with Web 5. What would that look like? In this post I try to imagine what the web could be like, to make people’s life easier. I feel we reached a point where further improvements in speed won’t significantly improve the experience, so the changes should qualitative.

**Ant Engine 开源**

我在自己研发的游戏引擎上已经工作了 6 年了。在 2017 年底，我写下了对这个新引擎最初的构想 。现在回头来看，当初的想法居然都落实了，只有一点例外：我们中途把编辑器从 IUP 转移到了 ImGUI 上。

**The AHA Stack**

Combine Astro, htmx and Alpine.js to create modern web applications sending HTML over the wire, replacing the SPA JS-heavy approach with a much simpler set of mental models and workflows. Releated: [What is Jamstack in 2024?](https://remotesynthesis.com/blog/jamstack-in-2024/)  

**Continuous Integration**  
https://martinfowler.com/articles/continuousIntegration.html  
Continuous Integration is a software development practice where each member of a team merges their changes into a codebase together with their colleagues changes at least daily. Each of these integrations is verified by an automated build (including test) to detect integration errors as quickly as possible. Teams find that this approach reduces the risk of delivery delays, reduces the effort of integration, and enables practices that foster a healthy codebase for rapid enhancement with new features.

**A developer’s second brain: Reducing complexity through partnership with AI**  
https://github.blog/2024-01-17-a-developers-second-brain-reducing-complexity-through-partnership-with-ai/  
As we look to empower developers with AI tools, we inadvertently integrate AI deeper into the way developers work. How do developers feel about that? And what are the most impactful ways to introduce more AI into workflows? We recently conducted 25 in-depth interviews with developers to understand exactly that. Releated:

**Build Your Own Cloud IDE with the Subhosting API**  
https://deno.com/blog/build-cloud-ide-subhosting  
In this post, we’ll show you how to build your own cloud IDE using the Deno Subhosting API, which allows you to programmatically deploy and run code within seconds on Deno Deploy’s global v8 isolate cloud. We’ll walk through our Subhosting IDE Starter template, built on Hono, Ace Editor, and Deno.

**The decline of React**  
https://gomakethings.com/the-decline-of-react/  
Over the last week, I’ve been seeing a wave of articles and Mastodon posts from people who I would consider advocates of React about how React is actually bad now.

**The Path for Energy Transformation: Systems Thinking**  
https://www.simplethread.com/the-path-for-energy-transformation-systems-thinking/  
Now that we’ve discussed why human-centered design is a necessary prerequisite for transformation within the energy industry, let’s dive into another topic that is just as critical… systems thinking. Similar to how human-centered design considers the needs of the people using a piece of software, systems thinking looks at any complex problem as a part of a larger system. Systems thinking recognizes that components in a system are often best understood within the context of their relationships, not in isolation.

**Dynamic Programming is not Black Magic**  
https://qsantos.fr/2024/01/04/dynamic-programming-is-not-black-magic/  
I’ll concede that dynamic programming is not trivial. But it is far from being unreachable for most programmers. Being able to understand how to split a problem in smaller problems will enable you to use memoization in various contexts, which is already a huge improvement above a naive implementation. However, mastering dynamic programming will let us understand a whole class of algorithms, better understand trade-offs, and make other optimizations possible.

**Culture Change at Google**  
https://social.clawhammer.net/blog/posts/2024-01-19-CultureChange/  
It's always trendy and click-baity to attack big targets, especially when those targets are full of hubris like Silicon Valley tech companies. People love "fall from grace" stories. But my goal isn't to throw dirt; Google is still a great place to work -- far better than most companies -- and still doing amazing things. My goal here is to call out a unique, beautiful thing that happened... put it out into the universe, with the hope that it can come back again someday, somewhere.

**2023 一蓑烟雨**  
https://geekplux.com/posts/2023-summary  
通过这些日常的生活，我慢慢也领悟了美国精神的内核——个体对个体负责。虽然简短的几个字，但不是很多人能理解。美国人不喜欢别人来打扰甚至管束他们，不需要让渡一部分权利给别人，来让别人“罩着”自己，更多的是自己对自己的一切负责，独立且不干涉别人。“只要关上家门，我在里面干什么都行”。

熊大姐和工友们领取的爱心餐背后，是微信支付团队发起的爱心餐项目。彼时，这个项目在深圳已试点半年，有了初步成效。团队想要更进一步，把只由腾讯基金会出资的公益活动，推广成更大范围用户参与的公益项目。「让大家一起来做好事。」

每个人都是不一样啊，不要去想跟别人看齐，而是要发扬自己。

**成为情绪的主人，而非奴隶**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/mkUtnZ8DvYHAf8bXxRZEdA  
情绪可以说是诸毒之首，因为它完全不像砒霜或鹤顶红那样贴有毒药的标签，大家都不敢轻易去触碰它！情绪没有这些标签，它甚至可以合情合理合法地毒害人！乡间俚语常言“死都不知怎么死的”，这句话放在情绪身上再契合不过。

寒冷到了极点，便是回暖。耐得住冬日里最后的一丝冷寂，才能遇见华枝春满。

**治病奥妙无穷的 “ 五行穴 ”**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/95cuzHKrZx2seh9IS5CoQQ  
人体十二条经络里每一条经络都有五腧穴，从每条经络的手指或脚趾端开始一直到肘或膝处共有五个穴位，分别是井、荥、输、经、合五个穴。而每条经络上的五个穴位又都具有金、木、水、火、土等五种五行属性，因五输穴每个穴位都特定的五行属性，所以又称为五行穴，它是古人用做气血运行盛衰的比喻，因此每个穴位有着不同的作用，用好了治病奥妙无穷！
