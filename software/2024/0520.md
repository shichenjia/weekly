**Manifesto for a Humane Web**  
https://humanewebmanifesto.com/  
The web is becoming hostile to humans. Users are tracked and their privacy is routinely violated. Search results are populated with ads. We are constantly spammed by bots. Generative AI threatens to turn previously useful public forums into soulless marketing soup, while sacrificing the livelihoods of the creators that unwittingly power them. Power-hungry data centres demand the burning of fossil fuels, and divert water and energy from communities, emitting tonnes of carbon in order to power this digital junkyard. Users abandon hostile websites that take too long to load on low-powered devices, or are forced to upgrade, as the pile of electronic waste grows. We need a web by and for humans.

The web turns 35 years old this August. Generations of developers have shaped this incredible technology and brought countless innovations to our lives. Now, it's the dawn of a new generation, with AI. Here are 10 exciting features unveiled in our Developer Keynote and I/O sessions that will guide your path to better development–through a more powerful web made easier. Releated:

**The Deno Standard Library is now available on JSR**  
https://deno.com/blog/std-on-jsr  
We are excited to announce a significant evolution in the Deno ecosystem: the Deno Standard Library, a robust collection of high-quality TypeScript packages, has officially moved to JSR, the new JavaScript package registry. Releated: [How to document your JavaScript package](https://deno.com/blog/document-javascript-package), [How we built a secure, performant, multi-tenant cloud platform to run untrusted code](https://deno.com/blog/build-secure-performant-cloud-platform).  

**Hardest Problem in Computer Science: Centering Things**  
https://tonsky.me/blog/centering/  
What I’m saying is: everybody knows how to center things. It’s trivial. And if you are lost, the knowledge is right there. Yet, when we look at actual applications, we see that these methods are not used.

**Why React Query**  
https://ui.dev/why-react-query  
This is the story of my favorite example of a piece of technology solving The 5 O'Clock Rule. A story of how a single developer in a small town in Utah – in his spare time, created a library that is used in one out of every six React applications. For context, that means it gets downloaded 3.3 million times a week and has been downloaded 323 times since you started reading this.

**Rethinking Text Resizing on Web**  
https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/rethinking-text-resizing-on-web-1047b12d2881  
In this blog post, we’ll explore our investigation into the importance of this guideline, how we analyzed our site issues, the technical benefits for using rem units, how we decided on an approach, the cross-browser support issues we encountered, and the benefits we saw in reducing the number of reported issues for Resize Text.

**The Worst Website In The Entire World**  
https://matduggan.com/the-worst-website-in-the-entire-world/  
I've used lots of bad websites in my life. Hell, I've made a lot of bad websites in my life. But never before have I seen a website that so completely expresses just the pure hatred of users like this one. Everything was as poorly designed as possible, with user hostile design at every corner.

**Behind the scenes of Threads for web**  
https://engineering.fb.com/2024/05/14/web/threads-for-web-behind-the-scenes/  
Ally and Kevin share how their team moved swiftly by leveraging Meta’s shared infrastructure and the nimble engineering practices of their colleagues who built Threads for iOS and Android. They also discuss how they balanced the need to ship new features with the desire to craft exciting experiences for people on Threads.]]'']

**Open source is neither a community nor a democracy**  
https://world.hey.com/dhh/open-source-is-neither-a-community-nor-a-democracy-606abdab  
I frequently argue that open source is best seen as a gift exchange, since that puts the emphasis on how to react as receiver of gifts. But if you're going to use another word as an alternative to community, I suggest you look at "ecosystem". Ecosystems aren't egalitarian. There are big fish and little fish. Sometimes the relationships are symbiotic, but they're also potentially parasitic.

**Promptframes: Evolving the Wireframe for the Age of AI**  
https://www.nngroup.com/articles/promptframes/  
Promptframes complement traditional wireframes by integrating prompt writing and generative AI to increase content fidelity and accelerate the path to user testing. Never use lorem ipsum again.

**老道长的肺腑之言：大道就是太简单了，所以没有人相信！**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/_ZZv_imQOccos6ky1W2VUg  
https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1x94y167sW/  
大道易得，一窍难求。《清静经》说“人能常清净，天地悉皆归”，人只要能安安静静坐在那，天地的能量就能够回来。祖师爷说，大道至简不繁，道是简单的，复杂的便不是道，那些故弄玄虚的把戏是讨厌的。少吃荤，多吃素，月光底下勤散步，万缘齐放下，长寿如彭祖。

**傅佩荣：今日谈国学 要回到先秦孔孟思想**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/yz8VS5a20UQ_myD1Mh1A9g  
古代哲学里，只有儒家和道家是完整的哲学系统，因为儒家的“天”和道家的“道”这两个概念，既不是指自然界，也不是指人类，而是代表超越界，是自然界和人类最后的根源。这符合所有哲学系统对完整理念的要求。

**大画 | 生命底层的代码**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/mTmvL9N_FNum2iqMY1DgHA  
我们每时每刻都在编写生命的代码，这些身体、语言以及思想上的行为，推动着这个生命的发展。时光迁流变化，生命代码的编写从无停止，编写怎样的代码，就将成为什么样的人生。

**冯学成先生：睡好觉就是“归无”**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/Iz0_l9UR0K0CTyyBiWXRXA  
我们应该有这么一个生活习惯，到了晚上就睡觉，守子时，一阴一阳之谓道，要合道守道。晚上主阴，那就是睡觉，睡得舒舒服服，连梦都不做。睡觉就是进入无思维状态，让五脏六腑、四肢百骸休息，让我们的肉体得到休息。

**生命的最高境界！**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/fwjh1TjdgVeftfSYIIX70A  
养生首先要养心，心态若是不好，一切都是徒劳。吃得饱，睡得好，身体才康健；想得开，乐得出，心情才愉悦。就像丰子恺所说：“既然无处可逃，不如喜悦。既然没有净土，不如清心。既然没有如愿，不如释然。”

**小满节气：自古人生最忌满，小满才是刚刚好！**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/fT2c26j_OOc3rMoEsCJCcg  
二十四节气中，有很多节气成对存在，比如小暑对大暑、小雪对大雪、小寒对大寒。但是小麦籽粒饱满的时候，却不叫“大满”，而叫芒种。  在中国人看来：月盈亏，水满溢，大满，是犯忌讳的说法。花未全开，月未全圆，才是人生最好的状态。
