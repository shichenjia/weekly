**We’ve been waiting 20 years for this: the indie web**  
https://thehistoryoftheweb.com/weve-been-waiting-20-years-for-this/  
With roots in the world of fashion, there exists a cyclical principle suggesting that every two decades, previously popular trends “every 20 years or so the trends that were once popular will begin to be on the forefront again.” What’s old is new again. However, these recurring trends aren’t just rip-offs. They are remixed and reinterpreted through the lens of a new generation. We are, perhaps, in a 20 year resurgence for the indie web and blogging.

**Web Development Is Getting Too Complex, And It May Be Our Fault**  
https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2024/02/web-development-getting-too-complex/  
An overwhelming number of frameworks and tooling available today gives the impression that web development has gotten perhaps too complex. As a newcomer, it can be frightening to have so many to consider, almost creating a fear of missing out that we see exploited to sell courses and tutorials on the new hot framework that you “cannot work without.” But perhaps that is just an exaggeration?

**Vision Pro Teardown—Why Those Fake Eyes Look So Weird**

https://zh.ifixit.com/News/90137/vision-pro-teardown-why-those-fake-eyes-look-so-weird  
We’ve got a lot of observations, some opinions, and a couple educated guesses about why we got the Vision Pro we have today on the teardown table. There is a lot in this device, so we’re splitting our analysis into two, with more detail on the lens system and silicon coming in a few days. Let’s go spelunking into a never-before-explored cave of glass. Releated:

**On comparing modelling languages**  
https://modeling-languages.com/on-comparing-modelling-languages/  
As a reader of this blog, you are presumably interested in modelling and are likely to know of at least some benefits of models and modelling in IT and computing. But can you confidently say—and justify!—which modelling language is the best modelling language? And would you support a call for modelling as a specialisation in an IT or computing degree programme, if not deserving to be a separate discipline outright? If so: why? What sets it apart and what are recurring themes across the various types of models and ways of modelling?

**(Almost) Every infrastructure decision I endorse or regret after 4 years running infrastructure at a startup**  
https://cep.dev/posts/every-infrastructure-decision-i-endorse-or-regret-after-4-years-running-infrastructure-at-a-startup/  
I’ve led infrastructure at a startup for the past 4 years that has had to scale quickly. From the beginning I made some core decisions that the company has had to stick to, for better or worse, these past four years. This post will list some of the major decisions made and if I endorse them for your startup, or if I regret them and advise you to pick something else.

**How to make a great framework better? - Svelte 5 with Rich Harris**  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7n17ajJpCo  
We sat down for an interview with Rich Harris, the creator of Svelte and SvelteKit. In this video, Rich dives deep into the philosophy, features, and future of Svelte. Harris explains how Svelte simplifies web development, making it more accessible and improving app performance by compiling code at build time. He discusses the evolution of Svelte from its early days in newsrooms to the introduction of SvelteKit for full-stack development. 

**Clean Architecture in React**  
https://alexkondov.com/full-stack-tao-clean-architecture-react/  
We’ll establish the fundamental code-level principles we’ll follow to build our application. We’ll see how they will support us when we start changing things in future articles, then we’ll expand to project-level principles and even patterns used to build complex systems.

**Write code for the web**  
https://mrmr.io/apple  
This is a yarn of three threads, and it got a bit long. The tldr is: Apple doesn’t care for me as a developer; I should write code for the web; Nothing is set in stone, really. The story is personal, but I hope readers find something they can relate to in their own life stream (I guess that's the point of blogs).  

**How I write HTTP services in Go after 13 years**  
https://grafana.com/blog/2024/02/09/how-i-write-http-services-in-go-after-13-years/  
Nearly six years ago I wrote a blog post outlining how I write HTTP services in Go, and I’m here to tell you, once again, how I write HTTP services. I'll structure this article into two main sections: an overview of my time at GitLab based on what I can still remember, and a collection of things I've learned as a result of my work and experiences.

https://github.blog/2024-02-08-githubs-engineering-fundamentals-program-how-we-deliver-on-availability-security-and-accessibility/  
The Fundamentals program has helped us address tech debt, improve reliability, and enhance observability of our engineering systems.

**What it was like working for GitLab**

I joined GitLab in October 2015, and left in December 2021 after working there for a little more than six years.

The largest model Ultra 1.0 is the first to outperform human experts on MMLU (massive multitask language understanding), which uses a combination of 57 subjects — including math, physics, history, law, medicine and ethics — to test knowledge and problem-solving abilities. Today we’re taking our next step and bringing Ultra to our products and the world. Releated:

**CTO Career Path: Before & After**  
https://blog.visionarycto.com/p/cto-career-path-before-and-after  
You live you dream and become a CTO... what is next? Being a CTO is a dream job for some people. They want to manage big teams, innovate cool things, or run a unicorn startup. Those all sound like fun. But what happens after you become a CTO? Before discussing that, let’s talk about how to become a CTO, including my own CTO career path. Understanding what makes a good CTO is critical because it directly relates to what you do after you become one.

**The world is awful. The world is much better. The world can be much better.**  
https://ourworldindata.org/much-better-awful-can-be-better  
It is wrong to think these three statements contradict each other. We need to see that they are all true to see that a better world is possible.

**九紫离火运开端的甲辰龙年，或遇五千年未见之文明大变局**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/oF2rk01iVz2IWpuuYxrziQ  
丰卦彖辞告诉我们要“明以动”，就是要看清楚再行动，要弄明白了再行动，2024年不是无条件的美好，需要谋定而动。这年特别不适合摸着石头过河，而是要弄清楚再下水。对于普通人的启示是：在丰盛中也藏着隐忧，这一年需小心谨慎。不宜过贪，要知足常乐，谨防乐极生悲，自身掉入火灾、意外、损财等。

**每个人都要有一块根据地**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/gd6s9bNdSMSqPKWrX4E2Mw  
其实在我们的工作生活中，往往也是熟悉的工作更容易成功，成功以后便容易产生自信，而成功和自信可以给别人一种靠谱的感觉，这些认可你的人，就容易成为你的合作者。在他们看来，你也代表了一种希望。而这种希望，起点便是既有优势和根据地。认清自己的既有优势是什么，并利用既有优势建立自己的根据地，然后以此为基础逐渐向外蚕食，可以说是成事的不二法门。

**孙思邈“养性”内涵发微**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/DPsAzX7JxtTFpC_C9ZxKmw  
基于道、儒、佛三家思想，从养性之源、养性之理、养性之用三方面对孙思邈“养性”内涵进行了探讨。此性以道家为基色，以儒家为提升，以佛家为依归，含自然之性、气质之性、道德之性三层次:自然之性即生物本能、生理欲望、心理情绪，孙思邈以“形勿极”节之；气质之性即感物而起、习染而变而成的脾性、习气，孙思邈以“和神导气”调之；道德之性即儒家之“仁”、道家之“道”、佛家之“佛性”，孙思邈以“道自平其心”养之。
