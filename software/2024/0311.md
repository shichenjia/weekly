**The quiet, pervasive devaluation of frontend**  
https://joshcollinsworth.com/blog/devaluing-frontend  
There’s a trend I’ve noticed—or at least, I think I’ve noticed. It’s the kind of thing that’s hard to be sure of; the kind that might genuinely be true, or might simply appear to be true if you look at it a certain way. I can’t tell if I’m right, or if the shapes I’m envisioning in arbitrary ink blots say more about me than they do about what I’m observing. Maybe it’s both. Maybe it’s all subjective gray area and I’m just picking a spot to draw a line. I guess you can decide for yourself.

**Why Browsers Get Built**  
https://infrequently.org/2024/03/why-browsers-get-built/  
There are only two-and-a-half reasons to build a browser, and they couldn't be more different in intent and outcome, even when they look superficially similar. Learning to tell the difference is helpful for browser project managers and engineers, but also working web developers who struggle to develop theories of change for affecting browser teams.

**Eloquent JavaScript**

This is a book about instructing computers. Computers are about as common as screwdrivers today, but they are quite a bit more complex, and making them do what you want them to do isn’t always easy.

**What I Learned About Software From Building a Chicken Coop**  
https://www.simplethread.com/what-i-learned-about-software-from-building-a-chicken-coop/  
I would not call myself a homesteader, but I have begun to dip my toes into the world of raising chickens. I’m doing so together with my wife, and if I’m being honest, it has mostly been her passion project. She did all of the research and I have mostly just been along for the ride. But since I’m an insufferable software developer, I had to find a way to somehow relate the chicken-raising journey to software engineering. So I’m going to talk about the construction of their home, and what I learned from building the chicken coop.

https://www.bryanbraun.com/2024/03/08/why-we-prefer-computers-over-consoles-when-introducing-kids-to-gaming/  
I grew up gaming on consoles like Nintendo 64 and Gamecube. I have a lot of fond memories playing games with my brothers on those devices. But as my own kids have gotten older, my wife and I have decided to first introduce them to gaming with computers, instead of consoles.

许多营销号说，有口气是因为牙齿上有病菌，这是因为刷牙没刷干净，所以需要更有好的牙膏、漱口水、洗牙器甚至是口香糖。从中医的角度看，有顽固性口气的人，不是因为牙齿没刷干净，而是因为身体的消化系统出了问题，也就是用来排污的管道堵了。
