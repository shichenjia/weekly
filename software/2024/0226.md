**Announcing web.dev for China**  
https://web.dev/blog/web-dev-for-china?hl=en  
https://web.developers.google.cn/?hl=zh-cn  
We're excited to announce that web.dev is now available on a .cn domain, making our content more easily accessible for developers in China. All content is mirrored and available in all supported languages on the .cn domains.

**How to make a better default Firefox UI**  
https://github.com/black7375/Firefox-UI-Fix/wiki/%5BArticle%5D-1.-How-to-make-a-better-default-Firefox-UI  
For me, there are 3 big and 16 small criteria for UI/UX design. I don't have the data or the environment to do A/B testing, so I have no choice but to predict user behavior, which is very important. I had to think deductively, using various theories.

**JavaScript Bloat in 2024**  
https://tonsky.me/blog/js-bloat/  
So all this time I was living under impression that, for example, if the average web page size is 3 MB, then JavaScript bundle should be around 1 MB. Surely content should still take the majority, no? Well, the only way to find out is to fuck around. Let’s do a reality check!

**Building Open Models Responsibly in the Gemini Era**  
https://opensource.googleblog.com/2024/02/building-open-models-responsibly-gemini-era.html  
The release of our Gemma family of open models is a next step in how we’re deepening our commitment to open technology alongside an industry-leading safe, responsible approach. At the same time, the rapidly evolving nature of AI raises important considerations for how to enable safety-aligned open models: an approach that supports broad innovation while promoting safe uses.

**Vanilla JavaScript, Libraries, And The Quest For Stateful DOM Rendering**  
https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2024/02/vanilla-javascript-libraries-quest-stateful-dom-rendering/  
It’s well-established that the web faces wide-ranging usability and performance issues, from user-hostile UI patterns and twisted search results to sluggish performance and battery-draining bloat. While the underlying forces might lie beyond developers’ control, questionable technology choices typically do play a significant role, often in the realm of client-side JavaScript. In the interest of furthering our collective understanding of this self-inflicted quagmire, let’s examine one small-but-significant aspect where developers take the reins: Painting pixels on the screen.

**Why my code isn't in TypeScript**  
https://remysharp.com/2024/02/23/why-my-code-isnt-in-typescript  
Frustratingly it was mostly replies as to why the dev was using TypeScript, or replies to those who didn't saying that they're probably using TypeScript wrong. I guess that's the state of the developer bro/you're wrong culture we've managed to create.

**React Trends in 2024**  
https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-trends/  
The year 2024 got me excited about React's ecosystem again. Despite the various challenges and dramas (the biggest one of them moving React to the server with React Server Components) we had last year, there are emerging React trends that everyone should have on their watchlist. Here is my list of exciting React trends for 2024. Releated: [React Labs: What We've Been Working On – February 2024](https://react.dev/blog/2024/02/15/react-labs-what-we-have-been-working-on-february-2024).  

**How Google is killing independent sites like ours**

And why you shouldn’t trust product recommendations from big media publishers ranking at the top of Google.

**UI=f(org): UI is a Function of Your Organization**  
https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2024/ui-fn-org/  
Your UIs, and the real life experiences they deliver, can only ever be as good as an organization’s capabilities to deliver on them.

**Things I have learned about Tech Leadership**  
https://medium.com/bbc-product-technology/things-i-have-learned-about-tech-leadership-5efcf94065ca  
I have now been a Software Engineering Team Lead on the BBC Sounds mobile apps team for 4 years. So what have I learned from this once-daunting, now-familiar role?

**My productivity app is a never-ending .txt file**  
https://jeffhuang.com/productivity_text_file/  
https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39432876  
So I tried various forms of todo lists, task trackers, and productivity apps. They were all discouraging because the things to do kept getting longer, and there were too many interrelated things like past meeting notes, calendar appointments, idea lists, and lab notebooks, which were all on different systems. I gave up and started just tracking in a single text file and have been using it as my main productivity system for 14 years now. It is so essential to my work now, and has surprisingly scaled with a growing set of responsibilities, that I wanted to share this system. It's been my secret weapon.

**见闻 ｜ 2024年，“做就对了”！**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/aHAXPTISx83qiVouqILSdg  
我们很容易给一件事“添加”很多所谓的道理、意义和价值，仿佛没有这些意义和价值，它就不值得干了。对于天来说，需要思考太阳出来的意义吗？对于地来讲，需要思考非要开一朵什么花有意义，什么花没有意义吗？天地不言而有大美。

**春季养肝，首先做好这两个习惯**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UVcsaNkfq5VrxTTxl25Asw  
1、早睡以养肝；2、趋温暖，避寒凉。

**伸出你的两只手，即可判断自己是否阳虚**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/SPHve3EAxKlP9Y9wAE9SIw  
先师李可老师跟我说过，现代人阳虚的症状比较多。如果你用自己的手掌心摁着另外一只手的掌背，你觉得是你的手掌背面比较热，还是你的掌心比较热？

**老中医一辈子的经验总结**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/YUCdh7AX1g2LMeWOpvTCsw  
什么叫药？为什么不叫饭？有其特殊的含义，我们用的药和“钥”同音，同音就同源。门打不开了，找大夫配把钥匙。好的大夫配得特别好，钥匙捅进去门就开了。

**传承弘扬中华优秀传统文化 习近平这样阐释**  
https://baijiahao.baidu.com/s?id=1791378205330216935  
春节作为中华民族最重要的传统节日，蕴含着我国传统文化的精髓。习近平总书记向来对中华传统节日和中华传统文化十分重视，并将中华优秀传统文化的时代价值概括为“讲仁爱、重民本、守诚信、崇正义、尚和合、求大同”六个方面。一起重温总书记的重要论述，传承弘扬中华优秀传统文化。
