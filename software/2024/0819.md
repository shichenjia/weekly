**Examples of Great URL Design**  
https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2023/examples-of-great-urls/  
URLs are universal. They work in Firefox, Chrome, Safari, Internet Explorer, cURL, wget, your iPhone, Android and even written down on sticky notes. They are the one universal syntax of the web. Don’t take that for granted.

**The Product Model in Outsourcing**  
https://www.svpg.com/the-product-model-in-outsourcing/  
Many people are likely very surprised to see me (Marty) write this article. That’s because it is no secret that I strongly encourage every company that is moving to the product model to stop outsourcing their core competencies. I have said countless times that literally the single most important thing are your empowered engineers, and that we need missionaries not mercenaries on our product teams.

Spoiler alert: I did not actually figure out how to solve the ticket! But the journey gave me a bunch of observations about what AI could and could not help with in such a use case. Releated:

**Crafting a 13KB Game: The Story of Space Huggers**  
https://frankforce.com/space-huggers-how-i-made-a-game-in-13-kilobytes/  
My game, “Space Huggers” is a run and gun roguelike platformer with procedurally generated environments and a pixel art style. I was inspired by games like Broforce, Metal Slug, and Contra. The engine was written from scratch in pure JavaScript and has since been open sourced under the name LittleJS. It’s a great little engine with many nice features packed into a tiny footprint with clean well documented code. In this post I will explain how my game works and the design process I went through while developing it.

**Fine-Grained Reactivity in Svelte 5**  
https://frontendmasters.com/blog/fine-grained-reactivity-in-svelte-5/  
We’ve been looking at the up and coming Svelte 5. We looked at basic features like state, props, and side effects. Then we looked at Snippets, which is a lightweight feature Svelte added for re-using bits of HTML within (for now) a single component.

**Building an Event-Driven Architecture with Managed Data Services**  
https://blog.heroku.com/building-event-driven-architecture-managed-data-services  
In this post, we’ll explore the advantages of using Kafka for EDA applications. Then, we’ll look at how Apache Kafka on Heroku simplifies your task of getting up and running with the reliability and scalability to support global-scale EDA applications. Finally, we’ll offer a few tips to help pave the road as you move forward with implementation.

**10 years of Classroom: What we’ve learned, and what’s to come**  
https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/education/google-classroom-turns-ten/  
Originally created as a way to help teachers save trips to the copy machine, Google Classroom has continuously worked with schools to meet their changing needs. It’s no longer just about saving time, but also about creating more of it — by helping educators extend their impact.

**A New Era of Medium Engineering**  
https://medium.engineering/a-new-era-of-medium-engineering-093b609c63ac  
This is a note I sent to the engineering team a few months ago. This has started a lot of discussions that have been the basis for a big culture shift we’re trying to make as a company towards long-term stability and success.

**老道长的肺腑之言：大道就是太简单了，所以没有人相信！**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/NYuvXGWG31RgcuM8g-7oJw 
大道易得，一窍难求。《清静经》说“人能常清净，天地悉皆归”，人只要能安安静静坐在那，天地的能量就能够回来。身心能够合一的时候，身体自然会发生变化，那时候，自然会引导我们如何打开那一窍，无论在什么地方，有空就静坐，不要想太多，凝神调息，调息凝神，身体能量储备够了，水到渠成，元神归位，姿势无所谓，要是双盘腿能盘成神仙，我早把自己捆起来了。祖师爷说，大道至简不繁，道是简单的，复杂的便不是道，那些故弄玄虚的把戏是讨厌的。少吃荤，多吃素，月光底下勤散步，万缘齐放下，长寿如彭祖。

**越平凡，越深刻**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/vv-FoJCPrgkgmnoT2KqqOg  
世人皆追求神奇，圣贤却只教人平凡。平凡与神奇的关系，这是一道坎。跨得过去，才能谈得上登堂入室。清代名医费伯雄在《医醇賸（shèng）义》中有句话，说破的便是这个关系，特有意味：天下无神奇之法，只有平淡之法。平淡之极，乃为神奇。

**一个“悟”字隐含着的重要修行原理**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/bIt0B7DLdqJCJwT0yGM-yQ  
一阴一阳之谓道。通过上面的一些知识点延伸，我们就知道“悟”字的本意就是我们（人）以心去与天与地沟通交汇，就是九九极数之归一，就是万法归一，然后，忘，忘忘，忘忘忘。。。坐也忘，站也忘，忘了那外面的一切，你就归一了。就象现在，你们应当直接忘了上面那些解说，都是葛藤。

**脾胃三分治七分养，记住这四个字，你的胃就好了**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/wE3PgNvdoYv2uujJ6Q7XNw  
脾胃三分治，七分养。保养脾胃要记住四个字，哪四个字呢？这四字口诀就是“汤、糖、躺、烫”。

**天太热，娃儿悄悄吃了冷饮**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/52YjjcrZpv8JaEW1V_fu4g  
首先，要给咱娃儿理论联系实际，冰是冬天才有的对不？所以正常来说冬天才是吃冰棍的季节哦。其次呢，天热，就是想吃凉的，咋弄呢？也不能彻底剥夺了孩儿的渴望，偶一为之，尚好。那么，真的想吃，也有几个方法略微抵消一下寒气。

**西湖滋养了他，他画活了西湖**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/H2RBxF242o9P56F5DTuhpg  
一幅《西湖景色》，便知何为江南。步入这幅画中，细密的点阵簇拥而来，层层叠叠，滋润为湖水，晕染为群山。湖光山色氤氲，平淡天真，点点墨彩铺陈，恍若有灵。陈家泠化用传统中国画中的米点皴，却改墨为彩。花青、藤黄，调和出静谧而淡雅的青色。水与色微妙的变化，形成清润通透的透叠感。光线、云烟、树林的密度、水汽的湿度，由水色自然流淌渗透而出。层层变幻的西湖化作千点万点，犹如诗词的韵律，更加缠绵、浪漫。
