**Making Technical Tools Sound Human**  
https://www.simplethread.com/making-technical-tools-sound-human/  
All our lives, we’ve received ideas about how things should sound. It’s how we know to use the language most appropriate to a situation, we’re polite with clients, friendly with friends, sort of apologetic when we get pulled over for doing 80 in a 45. We’re socialized to know how these interactions should go. We’re also getting more and more socialized to how apps and digital tools should sound, too: those we use for work (Microsoft Office) are going to be a little more pragmatic-sounding than, say, Instagram. This is called the app’s voice, and it’s a key part of how the app connects with users.

**Liskov’s Gun: The parallel evolution of React and Web Components**  
https://www.baldurbjarnason.com/2024/liskovs-gun/  
Described this way, you might wonder how an otherwise innocuous set of web APIs, designed to aid in the making of reusable widgets, so consistently cause tension and conflict among web developers. So much so that it’s almost certainly a very bad idea for me to wade into it with this essay. Why do Web Components cause online web developer communities to erupt in anger and argument? To answer that, we need to go back over a decade, at least thirteen years, all the way back to 2011.

**How to convert CommonJS to ESM**  
https://deno.com/blog/convert-cjs-to-esm  
All new JavaScript should be written in ESM for future proofing. However, there are many cases where a legacy code base needs to be modernized for compatibility reasons with newer packages. In this blog post, we’ll show you how to migrate the syntax of a legacy CommonJS project to one that supports ESM and tools to help smooth out that process.

**The story of web framework Hono, from the creator of Hono**  
https://blog.cloudflare.com/the-story-of-web-framework-hono-from-the-creator-of-hono/  
“While trying to create my applications, I ended up creating my framework for them.” — a classic example of yak shaving. However, Hono is now used by many developers, including Cloudflare, which uses Hono in core products. So, this journey into the depths of yak shaving was ultimately meaningful.

**Using static websites for tiny archives**

Tagged with digital preservation, html  Posted 16 October 2024
In my previous post, I talked about how I’m trying to be more intentional and deliberate with my digital data. I don’t just want to keep everything – I want to keep stuff that I’m actually going to look at again. As part of that process, I’m trying to be better about organising my files. Keeping something is pointless if I can’t find it later.

**一到秋冬皮肤又干又痒？这几个方法简单又有效**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/EfmQC2A3uWm8NiUFvUdzAQ  
从林老师的书中，包括学堂过往的一些诊疗经验中，我们认为“痒”，也是一种身体结构下的感受，是因为皮肤组织里的张力改变导致。一般皮肤痒的感觉，是因为肌肉跟皮肤之间的张力出现改变，组织间产生了褶皱转折的张力。用手抓一抓可以立刻止痒，也是暂时改变了组织里面轻微扭曲转折的张力。书中林老师用了拔罐器后，疏通了皮下组织，组织液流通了，张力改变，因此就不痒了。同样的道理，爷爷奶奶们在秋冬，皮肤的瘙痒更严重，这是因为他们随着年纪的增长，皮下脂肪变少，组织萎缩，因此皮肤与肌肉之间的张力改变更大，所以就会痒的更厉害。

**治疗感冒的实用方法**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/KmhAYqXdtSBknmZV3ZPYpg  
真感冒，只是一个病名，一个代名词而已。我们可以根据每个人表现出来的症状，去推测一个人内部，出现了什么样的不平衡，然后对症解决。我们要关爱自己的身体。平常有空的时候，可以把手搓热，在身上到处揉一揉。身体喜欢被爱护、关怀，要像爱护自己的小孩一样，关怀着自己的身体，不要每天过度使用、虐待身体。

**浅谈心血管问题的预防和非药物调理**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/IodGIb_F6pUEzY2pO1OTtw  
时间过得真快，秋天的最后一个节气就在眼前，这也预示着冬天即将到来。那今天我们就来聊聊心臓，为预防冬季心血管问题做好准备。

**关于“排寒”，这些你可能想知道**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/t12XwZnM-1C2yXTzm4DvfQ  
排寒是指身体能量提升、经络相对通畅后，推动体内积累的寒湿排出体外的一种现象。一般多见于艾灸、针灸、站桩、打坐、正骨等过程中或过程后。也有同学在晒太阳、泡脚、穿棉裤、喝扶阳茶、贴暖宝宝时都体验过排寒。

**一位觉悟者把命和病讲透了！**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/omIMORFtoBO39XofrJZcng  
整个天地间的万事万物，就像是一个巨大的交响乐，跟天地这个大的交响乐一起走，走得平常中和，这是健康的标准。生病了，其实就是被老天踢出去了。所以，病在古代叫做“失常”，病因叫“失节”，或者“失势”。那什么叫健康呢？健康就是“常”。健康不是说你面色红润，精神饱满什么的，不是这些东西，也不是肌力多少，心跳多少……“常”是什么东西？与自己、与社会、与这个大千世界处在相对和谐的关系中，能跟着自然的节奏玩，这是最重要的一点。

**胖东来：影响一座城的玄学**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/2cs1oAtFyMqD7tT5D85s1Q  
胖东来为什么会火？火的不只是货真价实、员工福利，火的本质是“胖东来击穿了整个社会不公的核心”。我们这个社会多少人在说假话，做样子，卖假货，当骗子，又有多少人贪恋权势，自私自利，勾心斗角，不思进取，不重规律。在胖东来面前这些桎梏和陋习全被打破，全部都扔进了历史的臭水沟里。看到胖东来，人们似乎又看到了希望的光。既然胖东来能够影响一座城，也许有一天就能影响一个省，一个国家。正如朋友所说的，胖东来的经营模式和现行的法律制度完美契合，它是全民所有制，集体所有制的变形，更是一切伪、劣、空的照妖镜。
