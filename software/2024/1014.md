**HTML is for people**  
https://htmlforpeople.com/  
HTML isn’t only for people working in the tech field. It’s for anybody, the way documents are for anybody. HTML is just another type of document. A very special one—the one the web is built on. Releated:

**Working from home is powering productivity**  
https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/fandd/issues/2024/09/working-from-home-is-powering-productivity-bloom  
Working from home (WFH) increased about tenfold following the outbreak of the pandemic and has settled in at about five times its prepandemic level (see Chart 1). This could counter slowing productivity and deliver a surge in economic growth over the next few decades. If AI yields additional output, the era of slow growth could be over.  

**Open source business model struggles at WordPress**  
https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/wordpress-struggles/  
Automattic, creator of Wordpress, is being sued by one of the largest WordPress hosting providers. The conflict fits into a trend of billion-dollar companies struggling to effectively monetize open source, and are changing tactics to limit their competition and increase their revenue. Reletead: [Automattic is doing open source dirty](https://world.hey.com/dhh/automattic-is-doing-open-source-dirty-b95cf128), [WordPress.org’s latest move involves taking control of a WP Engine plugin](https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/12/24268637/wordpress-org-matt-mullenweg-acf-fork-secure-custom-fields-wp-engine).  

**On the Nature of Time**  
https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2024/10/on-the-nature-of-time/  
Time is a central feature of human experience. But what actually is it? In traditional scientific accounts it’s often represented as some kind of coordinate much like space (though a coordinate that for some reason is always systematically increasing for us). But while this may be a useful mathematical description, it’s not telling us anything about what time in a sense “intrinsically is”. We get closer as soon as we start thinking in computational terms.

**The Static Site Paradox**  
https://kristoff.it/blog/static-site-paradox/  
Weird as it might be, it's not a great mystery why that is: it's easier to spin up a Wordpress blog than it is to figure out by yourself all the intermediate steps.  

**Automating Processes with Software is HARD**  
https://hardcoresoftware.learningbyshipping.com/p/222-automating-processes-with-software  
We have decades of experience trying to automate processes. My biggest lesson is that automation is not about the easy and known flow, but about exception handling.

**2024: More CSS At-Rules Than the Past Decade Combined**  
https://css-tricks.com/2024-more-css-at-rules-than-the-past-decade-combined/  
This happened to me while working on Monday’s article about at-rules. All I did there was focus on a number of recipes to test browser support for CSS at-rules. In the process, I began to realize, geez we have so many new at-rules — I wonder how many of them are from this year alone. That’s the rabbit hole I found myself in once I wrapped up the article I was working on. And guess what, my hunch was right: 2024 has brought more at-rules than an entire decade of CSS.

**Rust is evolving from system-level language to UI and frontend development**  
https://stackoverflow.blog/2024/10/08/think-you-don-t-need-observability-think-again/  
Ben and Ryan chat with Daniela Miao, cofounder and CTO of Momento, a real-time data platform. They discuss the advantages of real-time observability, the challenges of multi-tenancy in databases and caching, the use of WebAssembly in UI development, and the benefits of Rust. Daniela also shares her experiences working at AWS and a startup focused on observability, which led to the creation of Momento.

**LLMs Are the CPUs of the AI Era**  
https://marmelab.com/blog/2024/10/10/llms-are-modern-day-cpus.html  
After building several apps powered by LLMs, I developed a mental model that helps me think more clearly about "AI programming." Releated:

历史文化遗产承载着中华民族的基因和血脉，不仅属于我们这一代人，也属于子孙万代。

**不要干扰身体的内政**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/s0JIIDxdtT_7NYxhXlspAw  
人体其实会自动调节身体的寒、热、温、凉、平。所以，我们不要一直纠结于哪里凉或者热，也不是说热一定比凉好。只要你的思维流通，身体灵活，没有不舒服的症状，就可以了。身体会自动根据当时当地的状态，进行自我调整。就像一棵树，到了冬天的时候叶子掉了，变得光秃秃的，其实这个时候树是在蓄积能量，为春天发芽、长叶做准备，这是顺应天地的节奏。

**盖老师 | 让生命发挥更大的潜能**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/un6xFuEqyLNMKn3V8tM2-w  
我觉得每个人从出生开始就像一颗种子，如果这颗种子能够得到很好的养护，那它就会长成应有的样子。病人也像那颗种子，只是在他们的生长过程中可能因为遇到一些挑战，生长得不是那么好，无法达到最大的潜能。而我作为一个园丁，我去“施肥”、“修枝”、“捉虫”，帮助他更好地发挥潜能，更好地去生长。

**“色难”与“容易”**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/Y2Qv4oWlo86sZq0UjF_G4A  
重阳节弘扬的是敬老，是孝道，是感恩，其实很有意义，可这些都知易行难。曾经流传这样一副对联，明成祖朱棣出了一个上联“色难”，文臣解缙以“容易”作答，朱棣思索片刻，直呼妙哉。短短四个字，一针见血。今天，我们就来聊一聊这副对联。重阳节不只是一年中的一天，不只是一次嘘寒问暖。把尊老、爱老、为老、惠老固化为制度、转化为日常，多办一些实事项目，让每个人生命的后半程既充满期待又拥有保障，让“色难”不再是个难题。另附：[书院特编丨让我们一起开启“家和万事兴”](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/8gykt_HVfpI5A6uhIdHXEg)。

**火克金：五星红旗暗藏的九大玄机**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/Jggsm-O8H-gGAuJQ7K--NQ  
国旗是一个国家和民族的象征，体现着国家和民族的文化、梦想和核心价值观，它既是文化符号，也是精神寄托和精神支柱。每个国家的国旗都有其特定的含义，但国旗设计者也有意无意地植入了风水元素和周易理念，我国国旗更是如此。

**我们不是“牛马”，我们是光荣的无产阶级！**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/fqx6rCCbjF5TM1rSYLrDeQ  
社会存在决定社会意识这一伟大的唯物史观又一次发生了威力，事实证明人民没接住，人民没有战胜走资派。那又能怎么办呢？还是那句话，还要指望毛主席他老人家保驾护航吗？他老人家能保十年、二十年，难道还真能“万岁”吗？最后还是要看人民群众自己。

**职场中年人“偷偷”学中医的一天**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/1vyBAgla9g6vFbu3_FKGwg  
一位朝九晚五的职场中年人，每天能抽出多少时间学中医？我们的一天常常充斥着工作、接娃、做饭、家务、陪伴、休息等各项议程，在节奏紧张的日常工作与家庭生活之外，想找到一块完整的时间学习中医，似乎不是一件易事。案例不太会、听课睡着了、实践碎片化……找不到时间的我们，还能说自己是在学中医吗？答案是，当然可以。
