https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/716962725  
Rspack 是基于 Rust 编写的下一代 JavaScript 打包工具， 兼容 webpack 的 API 和生态，并提供 10 倍于 webpack 的构建性能。在 18 个月前，我们开源了 Rspack 0.1，并收到了大量来自社区的反馈和贡献。在这期间，170 位贡献者参与了 Rspack 开发，提交了超过 5000 个 pull request 和超过 2000 个 issues，帮助 Rspack 快速迭代了 80 个版本。同时，Rspack 的 npm 周下载量也突破了 10 万。今天，Rspack 终于到达了一个崭新的阶段 —— 1.0。这意味着 Rspack 已经达到生产稳定，覆盖了 webpack 绝大多数的 API 和功能，并已经做好支持更多用户的准备。

**Developers Rail Against JavaScript ‘Merchants of Complexity’**  
https://thenewstack.io/developers-rail-against-javascript-merchants-of-complexity/  
When both Pieter Levels and Alex Russell convincingly argue against using complex JavaScript frameworks, maybe frontend devs should listen.

**The Monospace Web**  
https://owickstrom.github.io/the-monospace-web/  
A minimalist design exploration. On this page, I use a monospace grid to align text and draw diagrams. It’s generated from a simple Markdown document (using Pandoc), and the CSS and a tiny bit of Javascript renders it on the grid. The page is responsive, shrinking in character-sized steps. Standard elements should just work, at least that’s the goal. It’s semantic HTML, rendered as if we were back in the 70s.

**Raw dog the open web!**  
https://www.fromjason.xyz/p/notebook/raw-dog-the-open-web/  
Monoculture is winning. The Fortune 500 has shrink-wrapped our zeitgeist and we are suffocating culturally. But, we can fight back by bookmarking a web page or sharing a piece of art unsanctioned by our For Your Page. To do that we must get out there and raw dog that open web.

**A company is a language**  
https://world.hey.com/jason/a-company-is-a-language-66517a62  
Companies are akin to complex languages, each with its own unique dialect and cultural nuances. And I think this explains why it’s so hard for executives — especially executives — to come in from outside an organization and find their way.

**80 / 20 accessibility**  
https://marcus.io/blog/80-20-accessibility  
Many people are confronted with the topic of web accessibility for the first time as a result of the EAA (European Accessibility Act) (why this confrontation didn't happen much earlier is another matter...) and are downright afraid of the topic, its complexity and ‘conformity’ per se. And yet I think that this static state in fear is not necessary at all, and that the topic of accessibility, like so many things, follows the Pareto principle and is, in its vast majority, a low-threshold and actionable topic for which there is no need to have a paralysing respect towards.

**How Uber Conquered UX Design**  
https://blog.prototypr.io/how-uber-conquered-ux-design-1d9c56788a41  
From the time it launched to the public in 2011, to the billion-dollar giant it is today; Uber has faced some huge hiccups that were solved by the magic of what we call — UX design!

**How to make your web page faster before it even loads**  
https://blog.sentry.io/how-to-make-your-web-page-faster-before-it-even-loads/  
All of this data about what happens before a web browser receives the first byte of data of a web page is pretty empowering. But the real power lies in putting that data in context in the Sentry Trace View. In being able to visualize and trace PerformanceNavigationTiming events and issues, we open up the door to being able to effectively debug slow parts of that timeline at a granular level, and make those all-important micro-optimizations where possible.

**How Meta enforces purpose limitation via Privacy Aware Infrastructure at scale**  
https://engineering.fb.com/2024/08/27/security/privacy-aware-infrastructure-purpose-limitation-meta/  
At Meta, millions of data assets are crucial for powering our product ecosystem, optimizing machine learning models for personalized experiences, and ensuring our products are high quality and meet user expectations. Identifying which code branches and data assets require protection is challenging due to complex propagation requirements and permissions models that need constant revision.

**SQL Has Problems. We Can Fix Them: Pipe Syntax In SQL**  
https://simonwillison.net/2024/Aug/24/pipe-syntax-in-sql/  
A new paper from Google Research describing custom syntax for analytical SQL queries that has been rolling out inside Google since February, reaching 1,600 "seven-day-active users" by August 2024. A key idea is here is to fix one of the biggest usability problems with standard SQL: the order of the clauses in a query. 

**Rust for Linux revisited**  
https://drewdevault.com/2024/08/30/2024-08-30-Rust-in-Linux-revisited.html  
Two years ago, seeing the Rust-for-Linux project starting to get the ball rolling, I wrote “Does Rust belong in the Linux kernel?”, penning a conclusion consistent with Betteridge’s law of headlines. Two years on we have a lot of experience to draw on to see how Rust-for-Linux is actually playing out, and I’d like to renew my thoughts with some hindsight – and more compassion. If you’re one of the Rust-for-Linux participants burned out or burning out on this project, I want to help. Burnout sucks – I’ve been there.

**Matt Stoller Explains Monopolies**  
https://www.wheresyoured.at/stoller/  
We talked about this, of course, but also looked at the heart of what constitutes a monopoly, how monopolies behave, and - crucially - the bipartisan political missteps and myopia that allowed our economies (and our lives) to be controlled by a handful of unaccountable mega-businesses that operate more like miniature governments.

**福生于“道阴”**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/nv9c-7YjBhJhfEjA80VL1w  
一定要养好自己的阴，养足自己的阴。多滋阴，少壮阳。阴满则溢，流出的才叫大机大用，强起的机用永远小家子气。甚至可以说，人事惟积阴德而已，其他都是应机随缘事，即所谓不得已。心性本乎淡定，生命本乎沉静，人生本乎厚德。让它们的比例变得大一点，再大一点，就是所谓的转凡成圣之路，其实并不抽象，本来并不高深。

**水，进入中国文化的密码**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/vq_6LaqorVyLYx-piTBzLw  
水是进入中国文化的一个密码。孔子讲，“知者乐水，仁者乐山”；老子讲，“上善若水，水善利万物而不争”。儒道殊途，但对水的喜爱与阐发是高度一致的。那么，水的魅力究竟何在？水与中国文化，又究竟擦出过怎样的智慧火花？我们不应该满足于符号性的理解，而应该回到那个水机与文心交织的世界。

**诺娜 | 宽容是这个世界稀缺的品质**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/3jbTvM0GxG_qdnZZWvXhOA  
一直都很喜欢这样一句话：每个人都很奇怪，除了你和我，甚至你也不例外。因为它直白地道出了大多数人心中的观点——其他人都很奇怪，只有我才是正常的，殊不知别人也是这么认为的——我们都很奇怪，他自己才是正常的。如果用独一无二来理解“奇怪”这个词，那么我们的确都是奇怪的。学习五行可以帮助我们理解这一点。

**心脏问题年轻化，居然是因为“心胸狭窄”?!**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/aBvz6DZ4W5hauSj5fwLcCw  
开心不仅是形容词，更是动词。保持微笑，嘴角上扬其实也可以提拉放松胸腔的肌肉，让心脏更舒服哦~

**李辛 | 中医眼中的人体**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/_KrmpVmpII2VEC1Tp170Mg  
“精、气、神”是三样无形的东西。我们现代的科学和文化，偏重于研究和学习有形的东西。最近几百年，我们把自己的感受、思想和生活状态，牢牢地跟某些有形的东西捆绑在一起。但这些有形的东西的背后，其实有一个活泼泼的东西，可以称之为“精、气、神”，也可以称之为生命力。

**温暖、喜悦、饱满、柔软、有弹性**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/5AI0tGeeKfk_c6qL81ekoA  
气血充盈的状态是：温暖、喜悦、饱满、柔软、有弹性，这就是我们中医看来健康的标准。
