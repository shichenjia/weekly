**40 Thoughts At 40**  
https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/40-thoughts-at-40/  
Well, holy shit, I’m 40! How do I feel, you ask? Great! Better than great. Fantastic even. Life’s a wild ride; I’ve had many many many utterly amazing experiences as well as some really truly capital-S Shitty experiences. After it’s all said and done, I’m so incredibly grateful to be here. So grateful for the people in my life. So grateful to have the perspective I have. So grateful to be where I’m at in life. So excited for what’s to come. 1. Family is everything. Find your people; 2. Everything is temporary...

All software is built atop a core set of assumptions. As new code is added and new use-cases emerge, software can become unmoored from those assumptions. When this happens, a fundamental tension arises between revisiting those foundational assumptions—which usually entails a lot of work—or trying to support new behavior atop the existing architecture. The latter approach is usually advised, to save time and reduce risk.
