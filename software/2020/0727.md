**OpenAI's GPT-3 may be the biggest thing since bitcoin**  
https://maraoz.com/2020/07/18/openai-gpt3/  
GPT-3 Language models allow computers to produce random-ish sentences of approximately the same length and grammatical structure as those in a given body of text. I share my early experiments with OpenAI's new language prediction model (GPT-3) beta. I explain why I think GPT-3 has disruptive potential comparable to that of blockchain technology.

**Design Docs at Google**  
https://www.industrialempathy.com/posts/design-docs-at-google/  
One of the key elements of Google's software engineering culture is the use of defining software designs through design docs. These are relatively informal documents that the primary author or authors of a software system or application create before they embark on the coding project. The design doc documents the high level implementation strategy and key design decisions with emphasis on the trade-offs that were considered during those decisions. As software engineers our job is not to produce code per se, but rather to solve problems. Unstructured text, like in the form of a design doc, may be the better tool for solving problems early in a project lifecycle, as it may be more concise and easier to comprehend, and communicates the problems and solutions at a higher level than code.

**Advice to Myself When Starting Out as a Software Developer**  
https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/advice-to-myself-when-starting-as-a-software-developer/  
Take the time to read two books per year on software engineering;  Learn the language you use at work in-depth, to the very bottom; Pair with other developers more often; Write unit tests and run them against a CI; Make refactoring a habit and master refactoring tools; Know that good software engineering is experience, Get lots of it; Teach what you learn; 

**可逆计算的技术实现**  
https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/163852896  
最近和一些朋友交流 Low Code 平台的开发经验，发现大多数工作都是由前端架构师主导的，主要精力集中在可视化界面设计器方面，这与可逆计算的理论有着很大的区别。当我们专注于通过类型（Type），函数（Function），类（Class），属性（Property）等等这样的术语去描绘我们以为的世界的时候，一些必然的事实就会被自然的遮蔽起来，成为我们视野之外的偶然。我的学术背景是理论物理学，所以可逆计算的思想来源不是传统的计算机科学，而是数学和物理学，所以我在软件构造中所想要强调的不是类型系统，不是函数式，不是对象化，而是结构（Structure）、复杂性（Complexity）和源起于物理世界的规律（Law）。下面我简单介绍一下可逆计算的一些具体的技术实现方案，希望能让这些抽象的概念变得更加直观可见。

**当我们谈优化时，我们谈些什么**  
https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/68158277  
当我们谈论性能优化的时候，我们究竟在谈些什么呢？我试着理解了这个问题的意图：如果我们换一种问法，比如“渲染常见的性能瓶颈有哪些？具体可能出现在什么样的情景下？为什么这些情景会造成对应的性能瓶颈？”会不会是一个更好的问题？所以这篇文章，是在试着回答这个新的问题。

**你可能不太熟知的布局技巧**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/HYUgb8jEI-aQhbN4sBajNw  
随着Web技术不断的革新，CSS近几年也变得多年前要更强大。在Web开发中，CSS是不可或缺的一部分，对于很多Web开发者来说，有很多CSS属性不知道，或者说他们知道，但忘记在最恰当的时候使用最适合的CSS属性。而且时至今日，其中有一些CSS的属性可以让开发者能节约更多的时间。比如说，在Web布局中，现代CSS特性就可以更好的帮助我们快速实现，例如等高布局，水平垂直居中，经典的圣杯布局、宽高比例、页脚保持在底部等。在本文中，我将会介绍一些不同的CSS属性来实现这些效果，希望大家会感兴趣。更希望对大家今后的工作有所帮助。

**Spanner’s SQL Story**  
https://medium.com/google-cloud/spanners-sql-story-79bda8bb632d  
Spanner is a distributed database Google initiated a while ago to build a highly available and highly consistent database for its own workloads. Spanner was initially built to be a key/value and was in a completely different shape than it is today and it had different goals. Since the beginning, it had transactional capabilities, external consistency and was able to failover transparently. Over time, Spanner adopted a strongly typed schema and some other relational database features. In the last years, it added SQL support*. Today we are improving both the SQL dialect and the relational database features simultaneously. Sometimes there is confusion whether Spanner supports SQL or not. The short answer is yes. The long answer is this article.

**Scalable data classification for security and privacy**  
https://engineering.fb.com/security/data-classification-system/  
Traditional data loss prevention (DLP) systems solve this problem by fingerprinting the data in question and monitoring endpoints for the fingerprinted data. For an organization with a large number of constantly changing data assets, this approach is neither scalable nor effective for discovering which data is where. Instead, the approach described here focuses on scalable infrastructure, multiple data signals, machine learning (ML), and continuous training to solve this challenge.  

**How We’re Solving Data Discovery Challenges at Shopify**  
https://engineering.shopify.com/blogs/engineering/solving-data-discovery-challenges-shopify  
Data discovery and management is the practice of cataloguing these data assets and all of the applicable metadata that saves time for data professionals, increasing data recycling, and providing data consumers with more accessibility to an organization’s data assets. To make sense of all of these data assets at Shopify, we built a data discovery and management tool named Artifact. It aims to increase productivity, provide greater accessibility to data, and allow for a higher level of data governance.

**Introducing Domain-Oriented Microservice Architecture**

**Rebuilding messaging: How we bootstrapped our platform**  
https://engineering.linkedin.com/blog/2020/bootstrapping-our-new-messaging-platform  
Messaging has been a core part of Linkedin since the day we launched and our system behind it has evolved tremendously over the past 17 years. However, the architecture of our messaging backend largely remained unchanged until a recent ground-up overhaul. In the second part of our “Rebuilding messaging” series, we’ll talk about the large-scale migration of existing data to the new database, or as commonly referred to, our journey bootstrapping data from our legacy system to the new system.

**Bloom filters debunked: Dispelling 30 Years of bad math with Coq!**  
https://gopiandcode.uk/logs/log-bloomfilters-debunked.html  
There's this rather nifty feature of modern web browsers (such as Firefox or Chrome) where the browser will automatically warn the user if they happen to navigate to a "malicious" URL. While conceptually simple, this feature actually requires more engineering effort than one would expect - in particular, tracking the set of known malicious URLs in a practical manner turns out to be somewhat difficult. Using a probabilistic data structure known as a Bloom filter, Browsers maintain a approximate representation of the set of known malicious URLs locally. By querying this space-efficient local set, browsers will only send up a small proportion of the honest URLs.

**Go command support for embedded static assets (files) — Draft Design**  
https://go.googlesource.com/proposal/+/master/design/draft-embed.md  
There are many tools to embed static assets (files) into Go binaries. All depend on a manual generation step followed by checking in the generated files to the source code repository. This draft design eliminates both of these steps by adding support for embedded static assets to the go command itself. 另附：[File System Interfaces for Go — Draft Design](https://go.googlesource.com/proposal/+/master/design/draft-iofs.md)
