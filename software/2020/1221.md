**Highlights from Chrome Dev Summit 2020**  
https://bitsofco.de/chrome-dev-summit-2020/  
CDS in 2020 was a bit different, like everything else. It was online, and the talks were more bite-sized at roughly 10 minutes each. I really enjoyed this new style of the summit and, while I missed the in-person aspects of the conference, this was a great way to end the year. So, without further ado, here’s what I’m most excited about from the conference!

**From Schooling to Space: Eight Predictions on How Technology Will Continue to Change Our Lives in the Coming Year**  
https://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2020/12/cloud-predictions-2021.html  
Rather than slow us down, 2020 accelerated our shift to a digital world and I anticipate we won’t go back any time soon. Thanks to this acceleration, from my vantage point, 2021 is going to be a launchpad for all kinds of change, and here are some of the areas that will be driving it.

**Liquid UX: the Future of User Experiences**  
https://prototypr.io/post/liquid-ux-the-future-of-user-experiences/  
Liquid UX is a state in which interfaces will leave physical screens / displays and flow with you on to different mediums and exist in your physical reality. The distinction between the virtual and reality will be blurred so much to an extent which you will not be able to tell the difference.

**Web Almanac - HTTP Archive's annual state of the web report**  
https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2020/  
Our mission is to combine the raw stats and trends of the HTTP Archive with the expertise of the web community. The Web Almanac is a comprehensive report on the state of the web, backed by real data and trusted web experts. It is comprised of 22 chapters spanning aspects of page content, user experience, publishing, and distribution.

**Get ready to up your Apps Script!**  
https://developers.googleblog.com/2020/12/get-ready-to-up-your-apps-script.html  
But as far as the overall developer experience with Apps Script, the core components of the Apps Script IDE (Integrated Development Environment) where developers spend most of their time writing and debugging code, managing versions and exceptions, deploying projects, etc.; that has been relatively unchanged over App Script’s long storied history—that is until now—and as an Apps Script developer, you are about to get more productive!

**Giving more tools to software engineers: the reorganization of the factory**  
https://erikbern.com/2020/12/16/giving-more-tools-to-software-engineers-the-reorganization-of-the-factory.html  
It's a popular attitude among developers to rant about our tools and how broken things are. Maybe I'm an optimistic person, because my viewpoint is the complete opposite! I had my first job as a software engineer in 1999, and in the last two decades I've seen software engineering changing in ways that have made us orders of magnitude more productive.

**在线Excel项目到底有多刺激**

**新风向标：学术界开始从Python转向Rust**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/wwFsXp3OPmulr_zu-H3XWw  
Rust 现在已经越来越受到科学家们的欢迎了，比起 Python，Rust 有着更高效的性能，同时在社区建设方面也让用户体验更舒服。虽然学习难度大了些，但综合下来，越来越多的科学家认为时间花的值。

**Old is Solid; New Gets Talked About**  
https://css-tricks.com/old-is-solid-new-gets-talked-about/  
Old can be solid, it can be dependable and it can be predictable. There are times where it’s fun to try new stuff and tell people about it, and there’s times to reach` for the technology you know so you can get stuff done.

**2020 Ionic Year in Review**  
https://ionicframework.com/blog/2020-ionic-year-in-review/  
With that said, the Ionic team had a very busy and productive 2020, and I wanted to recap some of our biggest updates, talk a little bit about how things are going, and what 2021 has in store.

**How to protect yourself from technical debt**  
https://www.tiny.cloud/blog/technical-debt-how-to-protect-yourself/  
Technical debt is essentially making trade-offs within an application’s overall quality; and that quality has many different elements, from performance to security to stability to even how well-written it is. Often those trade-offs create issues that will need to be dealt with in the future. Developers almost always have a timeline to get a feature done, and they meet that deadline as best as they can while producing the most stable, resilient, well-written, and secure code possible.

**Reducing flaky builds by 18x**  
https://github.blog/2020-12-16-reducing-flaky-builds-by-18x/  
By reducing the number of flaky builds by 18x, the new system makes CI more trustworthy and red builds more meaningful. If your pull request has a failure, it’s a sign you need to change something, not a sign you should hit Rebuild. When it comes time to deploy, you can be sure that your build won’t go red late in the day because a test doesn’t take into account daylight saving time. This keeps us moving, even when we make mistakes.

**How we made GitLab more secure in 2020**

From preventing vulnerabilities to squashing bugs in source code; here’s how our security team has made GitLab more secure in 2020, and where they’ll focus efforts in 2021.

**Stripe’s payments APIs: the first ten years**  
https://stripe.com/blog/payment-api-design  
Abstracting away the complexity of payments has driven the evolution of our APIs over the last decade. This post provides the context, inflection points, and conceptual frameworks behind our API design. It’s the extreme exception that our approach to APIs makes the cover of a business magazine. This post shares a bit more of how we’ve grown around and beyond those seven lines.

**Rex: Medium’s Go Recommendations Microservice**  
https://medium.engineering/rex-mediums-go-recommendation-microservice-e077bc9582a  
This blog post was originally written in early 2019. It gives a great overview of why we built Rex and how it initially worked, but a lot has changed since then. Look for future stories on how Rex has evolved over time.

**Co-experiences: Hanging out in the digital living room**  
https://engineering.fb.com/2020/12/16/android/co-experiences/  
What do we mean by co-experiences? Think about those moments in your own living room when you feel closer to friends and family. Those probably include sitting down for a long chat, but also experiences like watching sports or an emotional season finale on TV, sharing music by a new band you’re into, or sharing old photos and the stories behind them. People bond over shared experiences, and we want to make video chat on Messenger and Instagram a space where people can share these same types of experiences in their virtual living rooms.

**If-then-else had to be invented**  
https://github.com/ericfischer/if-then-else/blob/master/if-then-else.md  
If-then-else is how we talk about conditions in programming languages: if something is true, then do a thing, else do a different thing. That's just English, right? Except that it isn't. I can't use "else" as a conjunction in normal speech, only in computer programs. Where did this else come from? It's a mystery. It's too microscopic a detail to have made it into books on the history of programming languages.

**Minimal safe Bash script template**  
https://betterdev.blog/minimal-safe-bash-script-template/  
Bash scripts. Almost anyone needs to write one sooner or later. Almost no one says “yeah, I love writing them”. And that’s why almost everyone is putting low attention while writing them. I won’t try to make you a Bash expert (since I’m not a one either), but I will show you a minimal template that will make your scripts safer. You don’t need to thank me, your future self will thank you. Releated: [Become shell literate](https://drewdevault.com/2020/12/12/Shell-literacy.html), [

**OpenJS Foundation individual supporter program now available**  
https://openjsf.org/blog/2020/12/17/introducing_javascriptlandia/  
The Cross Project Council created JavaScriptLandia because community members wanted a way to show off their involvement and support for our project and cross-project communities, as foundation member companies do through their sponsorship. The CPC also sought to create more leadership opportunities for community members outside of and between our open source projects. This creates stronger bonds and a richer picture of OpenJS Foundation contributors.

On the flipside, to the extent that v2 social networking allows people to be themselves in all the different ways they wish to be, the more likely it is they become close to people who see other parts of the world in ways that differ from their own. Critically, though, unlike Facebook or Twitter, that exposure happens in an environment of trust that encourages understanding, not posturing.
