**If not SPAs, What?**  
https://macwright.com/2020/10/28/if-not-spas.html  
A few months ago, I wrote an article about [how the SPA pattern has failed to simplify web development](https://macwright.com/2020/05/10/spa-fatigue.html). The SPA pattern (Single-Page Apps), I tried to define, was about the React model, which also covers, to a large extent, the model of Vue, Angular, and other frontend frameworks. Like any critique, it begs for a prescription and I didn’t give one, other than gesturing toward server-side frameworks like Rails and Django. But I think there are some trends starting to form. I had queued up some time to really dive into the frameworks, but things like walking in parks have taken priority, so here’s just a grand tour. If you’re not a fan of the SPA approach, what else can you do? Turns out there are numerous modern alternatives from [Stimulus](https://stimulusjs.org/) to [RedwoodJS](https://redwoodjs.com/).

**Building a multi-platform Figma/Sketch plugin with React**

**The Pragmatic Programmer 20 Years Later**  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AzkH8SYyOc  
Dave Thomas and Andy Hunt conquered the world in the late 90s with the best-selling book The Pragmatic Programmer, which quickly became a staple for every programmer. This book came straight from the programming trenches, cutting through the increasing specialization and technicalities of modern software development to examine the core process - taking a requirement and producing working, maintainable code that delights its users
20 years later, they are back with a new edition that has major revisions and new material reflecting changes in the industry since its first release.

https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24915887  
This article may seem to be about bashing Google but it isn't. It's just about reflecting on the current state and how much longer we should see ourselves here. So what is the Web? Well we can agree the Web is a conglomerate of standards proposed by the W3C. So what do those standards define?The world’s first multi-platform design tool plugin

**Understanding when to use useMemo**  
https://maxrozen.com/understanding-when-use-usememo/  
Using useMemo isn’t free of pitfalls as well - one of the big ones is that the cache isn’t guaranteed to keep all of its values between renders. Taken from the docs: You may rely on useMemo as a performance optimization, not as a semantic guarantee. Translation: the cache isn’t stable! Meaning if you absolutely want to avoid recalculations with your useMemo call, it’s not guaranteed.

**Native地图与Web融合技术的应用与实践**  
https://tech.meituan.com/2020/10/30/native-web-pratice-in-meituan.html  
美团打车业务很早就在美团App与点评App中提供了服务入口，并在技术上采用了H5与Native的混合开发技术。随着业务上线，有用户反馈我们的地图性能有一些问题，原因是我们打车地图使用的是Web版的地图（通过腾讯地图JavaScript API)，业内同类产品使用的是Native版的地图SDK，Native地图相比Web地图具有天然的性能优势，所以美团打车地图从首屏地图加载到后续的地图操作体验都有一定差距​。

**End-to-end testing - Interview with Erik Fogg**

It's part of the whole picture. Martin Fowler has a great article on how end-to-end testing fits into a more extensive collection of testing methodologies that are necessary for a great software team to ship high-quality code quickly.

**Making GitHub CI workflow 3x faster**  
https://github.blog/2020-10-29-making-github-ci-workflow-3x-faster/  
At GitHub, we use the Four Key Metrics of high performing software development to help frame our engineering fundamentals effort. As we measured Lead Time for Changes—the time it takes for code to be successfully running in production—we identified that developers waited an average of 45 minutes for a successful run of our continuous integration suite to complete before merging any change. This 45-minute lead time was repeated once more before deploying a merge branch. In a perfect scenario, a developer waited almost two hours after checking in code before the change went live on GitHub.com. This 45-minute CI now takes only 15 minutes to run! Here is a deep dive on how we made GitHub’s CI workflow 3x faster.

**How we optimized infrastructure spend at GitLab**

**Should We Be on the Lookout for OAuth 3.0?**  
https://blog.gotocon.com/2020/10/28/should-we-be-on-the-lookout-for-oauth-3-0/  
OAuth.net recently shared details around the ongoing effort to create a next-generation protocol based on years of knowledge and experience with OAuth 2. This new specification would encompass many more use cases than OAuth originally set out to solve, and while it’s still in its early stages of development, you can get involved by joining the IETF Working Group or attending OAuth events.

**Our counterintuitive fix for Android path normalization**  
https://dropbox.tech/mobile/our-counterintuitive-fix-for-android-path-normalization  
Since its inception, the Dropbox Android app has had challenges sharing files and folders with special names. These problems ranged from being unable to see folders with Cyrillic characters to crashing when attempting to load content within certain paths. The root cause of the problem was easy to identify, as we’ll explain, but the obvious fix was far too risky to attempt. Instead, by going against conventional wisdom, we devised and carried out a plan that was both low-risk and low-cost.

**What Twitter learned from the Recsys 2020 Challenge**  
https://blog.twitter.com/engineering/en_us/topics/insights/2020/what_twitter_learned_from_recsys2020.html  
Recommender systems are an important part of modern social networks and e-commerce platforms. They aim to maximize user satisfaction as well as other key business objectives. At the same time, there is a lack of large-scale public social network datasets for the scientific community to use when building and benchmarking new models to tailor content to user interests. In the past year we have worked to address exactly that problem.

**Netflix Android and iOS Studio Apps — now powered by Kotlin Multiplatform**  
https://netflixtechblog.com/netflix-android-and-ios-studio-apps-kotlin-multiplatform-d6d4d8d25d23  
The high likelihood of unreliable network connectivity led us to lean into mobile solutions for robust client side persistence and offline support. The need for fast product delivery led us to experiment with a multiplatform architecture. Now we’re taking this one step further by using Kotlin Multiplatform to write platform agnostic business logic once in Kotlin and compiling to a Kotlin library for Android and a native Universal Framework for iOS via Kotlin/Native.

**Graphical User Interface Using Flutter in Embedded Systems**

**Communities and Connections will power our growth in 2021**  
https://stackoverflow.blog/2020/10/28/communities-and-connections-will-power-our-growth-in-2021/  
Traditionally, a company would start with a product, build a brand around that, and see a community form around the use of their product or the spirit of their brand. At Stack Overflow, we have done just the opposite. We began with a community and a mission to democratize access to information on code. Over time, collaboration and knowledge sharing became the core of our brand. Last but not least, we built products that grew out of the foundation our community had created and out of what we learned from crafting great Q&A systems for them to use.
