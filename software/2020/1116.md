https://blog.bitsrc.io/kiss-solid-yagni-and-other-fun-acronyms-b5d207530335  
We’re constantly dealing with acronyms as software developers, but do we actually know what they all mean?

**Ecosystem Innovation with Lightning Web Components**  
https://developer.salesforce.com/blogs/2020/11/ecosystem-innovation-with-lightning-web-components.html  
We are happy to share that WebComponents.dev now fully supports LWC for both on-platform and off-platform development. We see a beautiful harmony when projects like this solve common problems for the greater good. This also allows us to put more time, energy, and resources into creating a better developer experience with our productivity tools such as the Salesforce CLI, VSCode Extensions, Code Builder, and LWC Local Development.

**Getting Started with Web Vitals**  
https://blog.sentry.io/2020/11/10/sentry-fall-semester-web-vitals-101  
To improve front-end performance in your application, it’s important to understand what kind of problems users are experiencing. They may be encountering slow load times, seeing unexpected shifts, or having trouble interacting with UI components. The question is, how bad is it? Is it perpetual-rage-click bad? Is it ditch-your-app bad? Is it rant-on-Twitter bad? Sentry wants to help prevent all kinds of bad, but first, we need to standardize what we’re measuring so we can tell you just how bat-shit-bad it is.

**前端如何突破技术与业务的瓶颈——Shopee一年半记**  
https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/284525549  
今天主要想分享三个作为前端，可能经历的瓶颈，然后讲讲我为了突破这些瓶颈，所做的一些思考与努力。这三个突破，分别是：从个人贡献者到技术架构师与管理者转变的突破、从带领单项技术到带领多项技术的突破、从带技术到带业务的突破。

A solid primer on the ways in which the flex properties interact and how they work under the hood.

**“Even simple serverless applications have complex architecture diagrams”, so what?**  
https://theburningmonk.com/2020/11/even-simple-serverless-applications-have-complex-architecture-diagrams-so-what/  
So what if the architecture diagram looks more complex, the application itself is simpler to build and maintain since you don’t have to worry about the underlying infrastructure that runs your code, and not to mention the deployment and operational models are simpler and far less demanding of your developers. All and all, serverless is a massive net win.

**How we designed Dropbox’s ATF - an async task framework**  
https://dropbox.tech/infrastructure/asynchronous-task-scheduling-at-dropbox  
This Asynchronous Task Framework (ATF) would replace multiple bespoke async systems used by different engineering teams. It would reduce redundant development, incompatibilities, and reliance on legacy software. There were no open-source projects or buy-not-build solutions that worked well for our use case and scale, so we had to create our own. ATF is both an important and interesting challenge, though, so we were happy to design, build and deploy our own in-house service.

**Building a ubiquitous shared infrastructure using Twine**  
https://engineering.fb.com/2020/11/11/data-center-engineering/twine-2/  
Twine is our homegrown cluster management system, which has been running in production for the past decade. A cluster management system allocates workloads to machines and manages the life cycle of machines, containers, and workloads. Kubernetes is a prominent example of an open source cluster management system. Twine has helped convert our infrastructure from a collection of siloed pools of customized machines dedicated to individual workloads to a large-scale ubiquitous shared infrastructure in which any machine can run any workload.

A slide deck covering the state of SQLite which is now 20 years old. The corresponding talk isn’t here but the slides are packed with info and examples nonetheless on areas like recursive CTEs, CLI improvements, and security considerations.

**Modern IDEs are magic. Why are so many coders still using Vim and Emacs?**  
https://stackoverflow.blog/2020/11/09/modern-ide-vs-vim-emacs/  
The endless war between Vim and Emacs users has continued ad nauseam over the years. It's less a war at this point than a grumbling shuffle of ingrained habit and stubborn resistance to change.

**Eleven Years of Go**  
https://blog.golang.org/11years  
Today we celebrate the eleventh birthday of the Go open source release. The parties we had for Go turning 10 seem like a distant memory.

**Announcing .NET 5.0**  
https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-5-0/  
https://auth0.com/blog/dotnet-5-whats-new/  
We’re excited to release .NET 5.0 today and for you to start using it. It’s a major release — including C# 9 and F# 5 — with a broad set of new features and compelling improvements. It’s already in active use by teams at Microsoft and other companies, in production and for performance testing. Those teams are showing us great results that demonstrate performance gains and/or opportunities to reduce hosting costs for their web applications. 

**Announcing AWS Glue DataBrew – A Visual Data Preparation Tool That Helps You Clean and Normalize Data Faster**  
https://aws.amazon.com/cn/blogs/aws/announcing-aws-glue-databrew-a-visual-data-preparation-tool-that-helps-you-clean-and-normalize-data-faster/  
Good analytics and reports rely upon good, clean data. Glue DataBrew is a new tool for helping you clean and normalize data stored in S3, Redshift, RDS, and other places which you can then use in systems like SageMaker, Redshift or Athena. Despite the rather dodgy name, this looks like a neat service and I’m looking forward to giving it a try.

**Aleph.js - The React Framework in Deno**  
https://github.com/alephjs/aleph.js  
Different with Next.js, Aleph.js don't need webpack or other bundler since it uses the ESM imports syntax. Every module only needs to be compiled once and then cached on the disk. When a module changes, Aleph.js just needs to re-compile that single module, there's no time wasted to re-bundle every changes, and instantly updates in the browser by HMR (Hot Module Replacement) with React Fast Refresh.

**从大自然这位设计师身上，我们能学到什么**  
https://www.uisdc.com/design-by-nature  
《Design by Nature：Using Universal Forms and Principles in Design》中文译本的名字是《源于自然的设计》。该书的翻译客观地说非常差，除了语句不通顺、表意含糊的问题，术语和名词也有很多明显的差错。好在原书确实内容非常丰富、案例多样，让人愿意尽量突破翻译局限，坚持阅读下去…本篇读书笔记摘录了本人认为比较有启发性或比较有趣的内容，希望帮助大家能够从「大自然」这位「资深设计师」的设计中，学到一些有益的东西。

**你说的黑是什么黑**  
https://isux.tencent.com/articles/dark-mode.html  
近一年，随着iOS和安卓陆续支持了深色模式，各个团队的一通操作，也的确为用户带来“眼前一黑”的体验。深色模式也成为了前阵子业界最火的话题之一。只是当设计师看了无数的关于深色模式的讨论；当无数产品跟进上线了深色模式；再当无数App的深色模式被骂的改了又改，回头来看看，你说的黑，到底是什么黑。

**Origins of the youtube-dl project**  
https://rg3.name/202011071352.html  
As you may know, as of the time this text is being written youtube-dl’s repository at GitHub is blocked due to a DMCA takedown letter received by GitHub on behalf of the RIAA. While I cannot comment on the current maintainers' plans or ongoing discussions, in light of the claims made in that letter I thought it would be valuable to put in writing the first years of youtube-dl as the project creator and initial maintainer.

**Timeline view unlocks high-output planning for your team**

Timeline is a new type of database you can use to scope projects and adjust their timelines with flexibility.

**Software development: should we stop? Maybe we should**  
https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25044031  
http://blog.spencermounta.in/2020/should-we-stop/index.html  
Software is not impossible. it hasn't begun yet, though. Software doesn't work right now, and today, *making more software* is not a solution.

**OKRs are about change**  
http://beza1e1.tuxen.de/okr_change.html  
Reading Switch, I discovered that OKR implements aspects of a successful change. While OKR is not marketed for change management, every business goal is about change. At least, I haven't seen a company which says its strategy is to "simply continue." Looking at it through this lens some misunderstanding becomes obvious.

**Attention Is My Most Valuable Asset for Productivity as a Software Developer**  
https://zwbetz.com/attention-is-my-most-valuable-asset-for-productivity-as-a-software-developer/  
My high-level workflow looks something like this: identify the problem to solve; think on the problem and let ideas percolate; research, discuss, and experiment with these ideas; implement and test the solution; deliver and maintain the solution. This cycle could repeat many times in a day. Or I could spend days stuck on a single cycle step. Every step in this cycle requires attention. The more attention I can devote, the more cycles I can complete, and the more productive I am.

**谁说中国没有 Linus？中国初代 IT 宗师封神榜**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/xkTmFGzraZzIw28ArWIM0A  
我国初代程序员大神所取得的成就并不亚于林纳斯，所谓中国林纳斯式之问根本就是伪命题，如果没有严援朝、王志东这些前辈的贡献，中国的 IT 行业不可能像现在这样繁荣。令人遗憾的是在 80 年代 IT 人的主战场是 DOS 这个快被人遗忘的平台，而时代抛弃 DOS 的时候不但没说一声再见，甚至连它曾经辉煌过的痕迹都一同抹去了。
