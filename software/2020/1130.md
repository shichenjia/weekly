**FrontPage: The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly**  
https://invisibleup.com//articles/33/  
We need a new FrontPage. A FrontPage that uses HTML5 and CSS3 and modern JavaScript and cool PHP stuff. A FrontPage that follows modern design principles like semantic HTML and powerful CSS styling. A FrontPage that is totally open, totally not a pawn in world domination schemes, totally not locked down to one greedy vendor, and totally not abandoned. A FrontPage that outputs usable, sensical, and simple HTML and CSS. A FrontPage that integrates with version control software like Git and planning programs like KPlan and communications programs like email or IRC to allow planned, meaningful collaboration. A FrontPage that lets people write and share useful and versatile WebBots like people do WordPress plugins today. (Probably using JavaScript instead of custom server-side plugins, though.) In summary, we need a FrontPage that lets the incredibly talented common folk retake the internet with creativity and originality. Because as nice as Facebook and Twitter are, let's face it, we all kind of miss the old days of lovably terrible hand-crafted sites.

**Why it's good for users that HTML, CSS and JS are separate languages**  
https://hiddedevries.nl/en/blog/2020-11-25-why-its-good-for-users-that-html-css-and-js-are-separate-languages/  
This week, somebody [proposed](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/5743) to replace HTML, CSS and JavaScript with just one language, arguing “they heavily overlap each other”. They wrote the separation between structure, styles and interactivity is based on a “false premise“. I don’t think it is. In this post, we’ll look at why it is good for people that HTML, CSS and JS are separate languages.

**The Lean Web**  
https://wordpress.tv/2020/10/29/chris-ferdinandi-the-lean-web/  
Suggests that the web in 2020 is a “bloated and over-engineered mess” and that modern web development 'best practices' are often making the web worse. This thought-provoking 50-minute talk shares ideas on how to fix the problem. Releated: [React, jQuery, Vue: what’s your favorite flavor of vanilla JS?](https://stackoverflow.blog/2020/11/24/podcast-289-react-jquery-vue-whats-your-favorite-flavor-of-vanilla-js/).

**The Tech Stack of a One-Man SaaS**  
https://panelbear.com/blog/tech-stack/  
Being an engineer at heart, each time I see a company write about their tech stack, I brew a fresh cup of coffee, sit back and enjoy reading the newfound little treat. A couple of months ago I started working on yet another private analytics service, a project which has gone through numerous iterations, and I feel lucky that 400+ websites have already integrated with it, even though it's still in the early stages. That’s why, in the same spirit as Jake Lazaroff’s Tools and Services I Use to Run My SaaS, I thought it’s now my turn to do a short write up of the technologies I’m using to run this new service.

**The Birth of UNIX with Brian Kernighan**  
https://corecursive.com/058-brian-kernighan-unix-bell-labs/  
When you work on your computer, there are so many things you take for granted: operating systems, programming languages, they all have to come from somewhere. In the late 1960s and 1970s, that somewhere was Bell Labs, and the operating system they were building was UNIX. They were building more than just an operating system though. They were building a way to work with computers that had never existed before. In today’s episode I talk to Brian Kernighan about the history of Unix. Releated: [Linux on iPad](https://ipadlinux.org/), [Gimp is 25 years old today](https://www.gimp.org/news/2020/11/21/25-years-of-gimp/).

**An ex-Googler's guide to dev tools**  
https://about.sourcegraph.com/blog/ex-googler-guide-dev-tools/  
I thought it would be helpful to write a guide to dev tools outside of Google for the ex-Googler, written with an eye toward pragmatism and practicality. No doubt many ex-Googlers wish they could simply clone the dev tools ecosystem inside of Google to their new company, but you can't boil the ocean. Here is my take on where you should start and a general path I think ex-Googlers can take to find the tools that will make them—and their new teams—as productive as possible.

**The future of web development on Apple Silicon**  
https://areknawo.com/the-future-of-web-development-on-apple-silicon/  
But it's web development we're talking about here and that's why today, I'd like to take a bit deeper dive into Apple's M1 chip from a perspective of a web developer. We'll touch on the general implication of M1 but focus mostly on the performance, development experience, and software compatibility that you can expect from these new machines. Let's dive in!

**The curl web infrastructure**  
https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2020/11/24/the-curl-web-infrastructure/  
curl and libcurl are and provide as much information as possible about the project, the products and everything related to that. The web site has existed in some form for as long as the project has, but it has of course developed and changed over time.

**Common Performance Review Biases: How to Spot and Counter Them**  
https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/performance-review-biases/  
This article summarizes the 8 common biases I've observed in performance reviews and how you - as someone receiving this review - can counter them. Most articles I write are specific to software engineers and engineering managers. However, this topic is probably just as applicable across any company

**Simulating color vision deficiencies in the Blink Renderer**  
https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2020/11/cvd  
This article describes why and how we implemented color vision deficiency simulation in DevTools and the Blink Renderer. According to WebAIM’s accessibility analysis of the top 1-million websites, over 86% of home pages have low contrast. On average, each home page has 36 distinct instances of low-contrast text.

**The most accurate way to schedule a function in a web browser**  
https://medium.com/teads-engineering/the-most-accurate-way-to-schedule-a-function-in-a-web-browser-eadcd164da12  
The setTimeout function is okay, but overall, for a 250ms theoretical timeout, the real/effective timeout value ranges from 251ms to 1.66+s. As of October 2020, the most accurate way of scheduling a function/callback is using the setTimeout function in a Web Worker, in a cross-origin iframe. The requestAnimationFrame function is the least accurate and requires to be inside the viewport, otherwise the real timeout can go up to several seconds, or even minutes.

**CKEditor 5: the best open source Markdown editor**  
https://ckeditor.com/blog/CKEditor-5-the-best-open-source-Markdown-editor/  
CKEditor is an open source rich-text editor. Even though it is mostly developed by CKSource, it has a large community of contributors backing the development efforts. One of the popular questions that we receive time and time again is the availability of Markdown editing. The simple answer is yes. Let’s dive a little deeper into this topic to get a more elaborate answer as to how. Releated: [Zettlr - A Markdown Editor for the 21st century](https://github.com/Zettlr/Zettlr).  

**如何基于 TypeScript 实现控制反转**  
https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/311184005  
最近接到任务，需要给团队封装一个基于 EggJS 的上层 NodeJS 框架，在这个过程中参考了 NestJS 、Midway 等开源项目，发现它们都引入了一项重要特性 —— IoC ，于是笔者借这个机会对 IoC 进行了一些学习和梳理。本文主要参考了 Midway 的源码，按自己的理解基于 TypeScript 实现了 IoC，希望能给大家提供一些参考。

**如何定制企业级前端研发框架？（基于 UmiJS）**  
https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/318727202  
怎样让前端基础能力被上层框架直接使用，而不是每个前端框架都去开发一套 构建系统、AST、插件机制、目录约束、路由、渲染、错误处理 等？蚂蚁内部的实践是：基于 UmiJS 或 @umijs/core 封装适用特定业务场景的上层业务框架。

**移动端UI一致性解决方案**  
https://tech.meituan.com/2020/11/26/consistency-in-ui-design.html  
UI一致性是绝大部分研发团队面临的共性问题，大家对落地设计规范，提高UI中台能力，提升产研效率具有强烈的诉求。通过UI一致性的建设，不仅可以在品牌上实现体验升级，更可以全面提高产研效率，为业务的快速迭代提供有力支持和有效保障。统一的品牌符号、品牌特征，有助于加深产品在用户心目中的印象。统一的用户界面和交互形式，能帮助用户加深对产品的熟悉感和信任感。而一个好的设计语言可以在体验上为产品加分，也能够更好的创造一致性体验。

**Should I use SwiftUI in production?**  
https://triplebyte.com/blog/should-i-use-swiftui-in-production-heres-how-to-decide  
SwiftUI — Apple’s declarative UI framework that works across all its software platforms —  is young and full of problems, but it's also magically simple and crazy fast to build once you get the hang of it. So we really shouldn't be asking whether it is or isn't flatly "production-ready." Rather, we must evaluate whether it's a strategic choice depending on our specific circumstances and projects. Here's some variables you should weigh to decide whether to use SwiftUI in your production apps.

**The macro problem with microservices**  
https://stackoverflow.blog/2020/11/23/the-macro-problem-with-microservices/  
In just 20 years, software engineering has shifted from architecting monoliths with a single database and centralized state to microservices where everything is distributed across multiple containers, servers, data centers, and even continents. Distributing things solves scaling concerns, but introduces a whole new world of problems, many of which were previously solved by monoliths.

**Why GitHub's CLI Team Switched From Ruby to Go**  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuYwyQllMpE  
GitHub famously uses a lot of Ruby (and was founded by four Rubyists!) so it’s interesting to see where it doesn’t make sense. This 3 minute portion of a podcast with Mislav Marohnić of the GitHub CLI team breaks it down. Portability, basically.

**Someone attacked our company**  
https://usefathom.com/blog/ddos-attack  
At the start of November, someone decided that they would try to destroy our company. They subjected us to multiple, malicious, targeted DDoS (Distributed Denial-of-Service) attacks over two weeks. They intended to damage the integrity of our customers’ data and take our service offline. This attack wasn’t random and it wasn’t just your typical spam. This attack was targeted at Fathom and was intended to put us out of business. But why would someone do this?

**Personal Data Warehouses: Reclaiming Your Data**  
https://simonwillison.net/2020/Nov/14/personal-data-warehouses/  
Simon, one of Django’s co-creators, is becoming increasingly well known for his work on SQLite-based data management tools like Datasette. In this talk (coupled with a written summary you can follow without watching the video) he covered the topic of ‘personal data warehouses’ and why you might want to build them for yourself.

**A brief history of enterprise data challenges**  
https://hassenchaieb.com/data-challenges-history/  
In this article, I try to take a step back and explain what the current ecosystem is made of. Why do we have this multitude of products and where does every part fit in the modern enterprise ? There will be quite some simplification. In reality, every company is different and has different needs.

**Modern storage is plenty fast. It is the APIs that are bad**  
https://itnext.io/modern-storage-is-plenty-fast-it-is-the-apis-that-are-bad-6a68319fbc1a  
In this article I will demonstrate that while hardware changed dramatically over the past decade, software APIs have not, or at least not enough. Riddled with memory copies, memory allocations, overly optimistic read ahead caching and all sorts of expensive operations, legacy APIs prevent us from making the most of our modern devices. Releated: [How io_uring and eBPF Will Revolutionize Programming in Linux](https://www.scylladb.com/2020/05/05/how-io_uring-and-ebpf-will-revolutionize-programming-in-linux/).

**You might not need machine learning**  
https://nullprogram.com/blog/2020/11/24/  
Machine learning is a trendy topic, so naturally it’s often used for inappropriate purposes where a simpler, more efficient, and more reliable solution suffices. The other day I saw an illustrative and fun example of this: Neural Network Cars and Genetic Algorithms. The video demonstrates 2D cars driven by a neural network with weights determined by a generic algorithm. However, the entire scheme can be replaced by a first-degree polynomial without any loss in capability. The machine learning part is overkill.

**Digital Tools I Wish Existed**  
https://jon.bo/posts/digital-tools/  
There’s a lot of generalization in my summary but the core issue is an extraordinarily high level of friction in the process of finding, organizing, and sharing digital content. In the rest of this post I attempt to explain the digital tools I wish existed, and how the the currently available tools do not suffice. What are also probably lacking are my habits and workflows around this - but I’m looking at tools specifically here.

**Reinventing the online exhibition format**  
https://thomasbyttebier.be/blog/reinventing-the-online-exhibition-format  
Today’s standards for online exhibitions are not overly exciting. A lot of art galleries and fairs seem to settle on samey white web pages showing a list of artworks. Museums on the other hand appear stuck trying to replicate physical visits on screens, resulting in awkward street-view like navigation patterns and overall clumsy experiences. It doesn’t feel right. Me, Family had to explore a different territory. We wanted an exhibition format that felt native to the web as a medium; but most importantly we wanted to design an experience that put the art up front and is conceptually rooted in the curatorial story of the exhibition.

**A Field Guide to DesignOps**

**Uncharted Waters: Why It’s Important to Design for Newcomers**  
https://www.uxbooth.com/articles/uncharted-waters-why-its-important-to-design-for-newcomers/  
As design professionals, we must consider design through various lenses to ensure we design for target audiences. If design relies on users’ mental models formed by their own perceptions and past experiences, are we inherently missing a critical lens? What if an experience is altogether new to a user? What if they’re a first-time user, a “newcomer”.

**徒步到北极点才知道，到底什么是战略**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UZq9WltDpIkl1HrF7Nh8Ug  
战略就是，你要先有一个远方的目标（去北极点），然后设计一条通往这个目标的路径（至少规划未来5天怎么走），最后根据情况做定期调整（每天醒来，重新规划）。另一篇：[美团同舟计划：如何破解棘手难题？](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/7FF3JQClGulc53yDxWwqbA) 也蛮有趣的：困难的事，是那些超出能力之外的事，你只能借助新方法、新工具、新资源才行。复杂的事，则是那些在你能力范围内，但是线索特别多，很多信息和反馈又很模糊的事。解决这些复杂的事，是没办法一蹴而就一步完成的，你可以利用“三英尺原则”找到突破口，迈出第一步，小步迭代着解决。

**How to Think for Yourself**  
http://paulgraham.com/think.html  
Curiosity seems to be more individual than fastidiousness about truth or resistance to being told what to think. To the degree people have the latter two, they're usually pretty general, whereas different people can be curious about very different things. So perhaps curiosity is the compass here. Perhaps, if your goal is to discover novel ideas, your motto should not be "do what you love" so much as "do what you're curious about."
