**Emergency Website Kit**  
https://mxb.dev/blog/emergency-website-kit/  
In cases of emergency, many organizations need a quick way to publish critical information. But existing (CMS) websites are often unable to handle sudden spikes in traffic. To make things worse, natural disasters can also damage local network infrastructure, sometimes leaving people with very poor mobile connections. I’ve written about the practice of publishing minimal “text-only” versions of critical news websites before and I think it makes a lot of sense to rely on the rule of least power for these things. When it comes to resilience, you just can’t beat static HTML.

**Get Static**  
https://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2020/03/22/get-static/  
If you are in charge of a web site that provides even slightly important information, or important services, it’s time to get static.  I’m thinking here of sites for places like health departments (and pretty much all government services), hospitals and clinics, utility services, food delivery and ordering, and I’m sure there are more that haven’t occurred to me.  As much as you possibly can, get it down to static HTML and CSS and maybe a tiny bit of enhancing JS, and pare away every byte you can. 另附：[Making Sure Content Lives On](https://bkardell.com/blog/ArchivingByDefault.html).

**It's not what programming languages do, it's what they shepherd you to**  
https://nibblestew.blogspot.com/2020/03/its-not-what-programming-languages-do.html  
shepherding An invisible property of a progamming language and its ecosystem that drives people into solving problems in ways that are natural for the programming language itself rather than ways that are considered "better" in some sense. These may include things like long term maintainability, readability and performance.

**State-driven interfaces with XState**  
https://blog.logrocket.com/state-driven-interfaces-with-xstate/  
An alternative approach to UI development is state-driven development. This approach puts states first and events second. To me, the core difference is that we go from being on defense to offense. Instead of the user being able to trigger any event, leaving us scrambling to catch them all and write logic to handle them, we give the user a state containing a group of events. While we’re in this state, the user can trigger any event in this group, but no more. I believe this makes UI code simpler, scalable, and more robust. [XState](https://github.com/davidkpiano/xstate) is a state management library that enables state-driven development through finite-state machines.

**如何打造高性能小程序门户**  
https://aotu.io/notes/2020/03/25/high-performance-miniprogram/index.html  
京喜小程序自去年双十一上线微信购物一级入口后，时刻迎接着亿级用户量的挑战，细微的体验细节都有可能被无限放大，为此，“极致的页面性能”、“友好的产品体验” 和 “稳定的系统服务” 成为了我们开发团队的最基本执行原则。首页作为小程序的门户，其性能表现和用户留存率息息相关。因此，我们对京喜首页进行了一次全方位的升级改造，从加载、渲染和感知体验几大维度深挖小程序的性能可塑性。除此之外，京喜首页在微信小程序、H5、APP 三端都有落地场景，为了提高研发效率，我们使用了 Taro 框架实现多端统一，因此下文中有部分内容是和 Taro 框架息息相关的。

Webpack5 模块联邦让 Webpack 达到了线上 Runtime 的效果，让代码直接在项目间利用 CDN 直接共享，不再需要本地安装 Npm 包、构建再发布了！我们知道 Webpack 可以通过 DLL 或者 Externals 做代码共享时 Common Chunk，但不同应用和项目间这个任务就变得困难了，我们几乎无法在项目之间做到按需热插拔。模块联邦是 Webpack5 新内置的一个重要功能，可以让跨应用间真正做到模块共享。

In the midst of the uncertainty and seriousness of COVID-19, we’ve been inspired to see a global community of scientists, government officials, journalists, programmers, and concerned citizens come together to collaborate on a variety of projects with the shared goal of understanding COVID-19 and coordinating on the best response. Even though many of these projects aren’t traditional software projects, the same collaborative development model is being applied to curated data sets, DIY instruction sets, and more. Below are some of the most impactful open source projects we’ve seen for tracking, understanding, and responding to COVID-19 so far.

MDX shines in cases where you want to maintain a React-based blog. Using it means you no longer have to create custom React component pages when you want to do something impossible in Markdown (or create a plugin). I have been using it on my blog for over a year and have been loving the experience One of my favorite projects so far is a React component I call Playground that can be used to demo small HTML/CSS/JavaScript snippets while allowing users to edit the code. Sure, I could have used some third-party service and embed demos with it, but this way I don’t have to load third-party scripts at all.
