**前端开发的瓶颈与未来之路**  
https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/139731168  
前端开发的瓶颈到底在哪里，前端技术是否已经走到一个十字路口，全栈化的系统架构是否能改变目前的窘境？本文将根据我自己的开发经历谈谈当下前端开发中遇到的一些问题和想法。我们再回到前端，那么未来的前端到底会发展成什么样？长期而言充满了未知数，谁也没法预测，但是短期来讲我比较关注几个东西：ESBuild、Deno、Figma。如果你仔细研究一番，上面的这些新鲜东西，都是起源于前端，但又不把视野局限在前端。或许这就是前端未来的发展方向吧。

**万物代码化：从低代码、云开发到云研发**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/9IKyltXqzRzG2YOmUVeu3A  
过去的几个月里，我陆陆续续和不同公司的人一起讨论了开发、研发的未来。光是发我写过的几篇文章的链接，已经不能很好地解决问题。所以我决定写一篇长长的文章，来帮助更多地人理解：研发的未来在哪里？我也是从我的所做、所见、所听中，构建了整个的模型，并非从未来穿越到现在，所以其中的一些设想，可能并非如此准确。

There is a sweet spot of React: in moderately interactive interfaces. Complex forms that require immediate feedback, UIs that need to move around and react instantly. That’s where it excels. I helped build the editors in Mapbox Studio and Observable and for the most part, React was a great choice. But there’s a lot on either side of that sweet spot. The high performance parts aren’t React.
 
**Deno 1.0**

https://areknawo.com/deno-why-all-the-buzz/  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/85x4uep6SAZ9v_AR2hqv4w  
With the changing JavaScript language, and new additions like TypeScript, building Node projects can become an arduous endeavor, involving managing build systems and other heavy handed tooling that takes away from the fun of dynamic language scripting. Furthermore the mechanism for linking to external libraries is fundamentally centralized through the NPM repository, which is not inline with the ideals of the web. We feel that the landscape of JavaScript and the surrounding software infrastructure has changed enough that it was worthwhile to simplify. We seek a fun and productive scripting environment that can be used for a wide range of tasks. 另附：[Deno worker for Azure Functions](https://github.com/anthonychu/azure-functions-deno-worker)、[10 Things I Regret About Node.js](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3BM9TB-8yA).

**为什么顶尖高手，都有窄门思维？**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/RWUPANKFMj1MlIf3XfCmLQ  
这个世界上，总有人选择开始简单的事情。虽然开始是“宽门”，但会发现，到后面竞争者挤满了道路，越来越难。而另一些人，会选择开始很难的事情，虽然开始是“窄门”，看上去荆棘密布，但一旦披荆斩棘跨过去，海阔天空。但其实这个世界上，哪有全程好走的路，哪里有一路“宽门”？差别只是，高手心中装着更大的格局，哪怕舍弃1000万的利润分出去，也在所不惜。他们不是不在乎钱，而是相信只要方向正确，资源、技能、优势，一切皆可积累。顶尖高手，总是选择“窄门”。

**大规格文件的上传优化**  
https://aotu.io/notes/2020/05/12/file-upload/index.html  
在开发过程中，收到这样一个问题反馈，在网站上传 100 MB 以上的文件经常失败，重试也要等老半天，这就难为需要上传大规格文件的用户了。那么应该怎么做才能快速上传，就算失败了再次发送也能从上次中断的地方继续上传呢？下文为你揭晓答案~

**干掉过多的if…else：据说这项技能可以看出程序员的境界**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/rXwqnPN2WiMxcLXOlz0cjA  
if...else是所有高级编程语言都有的必备功能。但现实中的代码往往存在着过多的 if...else。虽然 if...else 是必须的，但滥用 if...else 会对代码的可读性、可维护性造成很大伤害，进而危害到整个软件系统。现在软件开发领域出现了很多新技术、新概念，但 if...else 这种基本的程序形式并没有发生太大变化。使用好 if...else 不仅对于现在，而且对于将来，都是十分有意义的。今天我们就来看看如何“干掉”代码中的 if...else，还代码以清爽。

**A (Mostly) Complete Guide to React Rendering Behavior**  
https://blog.isquaredsoftware.com/2020/05/blogged-answers-a-mostly-complete-guide-to-react-rendering-behavior/  
I've seen a lot of ongoing confusion over when, why, and how React will re-render components, and how use of Context and React-Redux will affect the timing and scope of those re-renders. After having typed up variations of this explanation dozens of times, it seems it's worth trying to write up a consolidated explanation that I can refer people to. Note that all this information is available online already, and has been explained in numerous other excellent blog posts and articles, several of which I'm linking at the end in the "Further Information" section for reference. But, people seem to be struggling to put the pieces together for a full understanding, so hopefully this will help clarify things for someone.

**Accessible Animations in React**  
https://joshwcomeau.com/react/prefers-reduced-motion/  
As humans, we tend to bias around our own experiences. The "Golden Rule"—treat others as you want to be treated—totally ignores the fact that people are different! Not everyone experiences things the same way, and we need to be mindful about that. An animation that delights me might make someone else so woozy that they need to lie down for half an hour afterwards. Every non-trivial feature that gets added to a browser is the result of a lot of hard work and coordination. The fact that the prefers-reduced-motion media query exists in every major browser is a testament to how much work browser vendors put in, not to mention the operating system developers who built the control in the first place!

**CSS fix for 100vh in mobile WebKit**  
https://allthingssmitty.com/2020/05/11/css-fix-for-100vh-in-mobile-webkit/  
Not long ago there was some buzz around how WebKit handles 100vh in CSS, essentially ignoring the bottom edge of the browser viewport. Some have suggested avoid using 100vh, others have come up with different alternatives to work around the problem. In fact, this issue goes further back a few years when Nicolas Hoizey filed a bug with WebKit on the subject (the short of it: WebKit says this is “intentional” 🧐).

**Let’s Take a Deep Dive Into the CSS Contain Property**  
https://css-tricks.com/lets-take-a-deep-dive-into-the-css-contain-property/  
This article has covered the basics of the CSS contain property with its values, benefits, and potential performance gains. There are some excellent benefits to applying this property to certain elements in HTML; which elements need this applied is up to you. At least, that’s what I gather since I’m unaware of any specific guidance. The general idea is apply it to elements that are containers of other elements, especially those with some form of dynamic aspect to them. 

**Convincing-looking 90s fonts in modern browsers**  
https://vistaserv.net/blog/90s-fonts-modern-browsers  
We wanted to make a website that looked like it was from the 1990s. Sounds easy, right? Looking back from 2020, the aesthetic of the early World Wide Web stands out for the things it lacked: no CSS, emojis, fancy web fonts or non-web-safe colours. 

**GitLab's Tech Stack Applications Diagram and Spreadsheet**  
https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/business-ops/tech-stack-applications/  
It’s neat to see what systems a popular, widely distributed company like GitLab is using. The [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mTNZHsK3TWzQdeFqkITKA0pHADjuurv37XMuHv12hDU/edit#gid=0) goes into quite some detail. 另附：[Inside GitLab: How we release software patches](https://medium.com/microsoft-design/how-fluent-ui-unlocks-the-next-generation-of-microsoft-365-experiences-8b24809faf06).

**How do I use Infrastructure as Code?**  
https://circleci.com/blog/how-do-i-iac/  
Infrastructure as code (IaC) is the process of managing and provisioning cloud and IT resources via machine readable definition files and is a part of modern continuous integration pipelines. IaC enables organizations to provision, manage, and destroy compute resources using modern DevOps tools. IaC enables this by statically defining and declaring these resources in code, then deploying and dynamically maintaining these resources via code. In this post, I will discuss the benefits of IaC and some of the tooling option currently available along with a brief demonstration on how to use them in hopes of easing the transition to using IaC. 

**Accelerometer and SoftSKU: Improving hardware platform performance for diverse microservices**  
https://engineering.fb.com/data-center-engineering/accelerometer-and-softsku/  
New strategies to improve the performance of hardware platforms running Facebook’s microservices. SoftSKU is a novel mechanism that tailors an existing server processor to optimize it for a specific microservice without requiring any additional hardware. Accelerometer is an analytical model that predicts gains from these optimizations even before the custom hardware is installed.

**First, it was Craigslist, next it's Zapier**  
https://kamerontanseli.ghost.io/first-it-was-craiglist-next-its-zapier/  
As I delve deeper into the no-code space I see a lot of Zapier, Integromat and Tray.io workflows. Some of these are actually quite complex and require some programming knowledge to understand them (which kind of defeats the point of no-code). As I was looking at some of these workflows, I couldn't help but think how there will be this eventual shift like with Craiglist where companies will spring up that just focus on certain more complex popular workflows.

**Understanding Cost Models**  
http://justinjaffray.com/understanding-cost-models/  
Analytic queries can become complex, horrifically so, in fact, and assessing their costs follows suit. To alleviate this somewhat, we’re going to explore some tools we can use to attempt to travel up the ladder of abstraction for query planners. In doing so, we’re going to try to figure out where the difficulty here lives: is looking at a single query confusing because we have the wrong perspective, or is there some inherent complexity present here?

**Make LLVM fast again**  
https://nikic.github.io/2020/05/10/Make-LLVM-fast-again.html  
Conversely, there are some ongoing efforts that might make for large compile-time regressions when they do get enabled, such as the attributor framework, the knowledge retention framework and MemorySSA-based DSE. We’ll see how things look by the time of the LLVM 11 release

**Up to 4GB of memory in WebAssembly**  
https://v8.dev/blog/4gb-wasm-memory  
Thanks to recent work in Chrome and Emscripten, you can now use up to 4GB of memory in WebAssembly applications. That’s up from the previous limit of 2GB. It might seem odd that there was ever a limit - after all, no work was needed to allow people to use 512MB or 1GB of memory! - but it turns out that there are some special things happening in the jump from 2GB to 4GB, both in the browser and in the toolchain, which we’ll describe in this post.

**If I could bring one thing back to the internet it would be blogs**  
http://tttthis.com/blog/if-i-could-bring-one-thing-back-to-the-internet-it-would-be-blogs  
But they would be the one thing I'd bring back to the internet if I could bring one thing back. They're the thing I miss the most and the most often. They were the most valuable thing on here, besides freer availability of news, free although low quality video content on YouTube, and I guess some kinds of social media. But blogs are something you can sit down and read and get really into to the point you forget where you even are, and think about how you want to try those things maybe in your life, or just enjoy their writing, and you can read deeper into them into past blog posts, and tune back in later and see what they've posted since the last things you read about them.

**The most successful developers share more than they take**  
https://stackoverflow.blog/2020/05/14/the-most-successful-developers-share-more-than-they-take/  
After interviewing several developers, a pattern started to become clear: great developers share a lot. This takes different forms for different people, but is very often a blog. But for many top developers, their sharing mindset came before their success, and was the direct cause of it, not the result of it.

去年出版第二本书《产品思维》的时候，编辑和当当网牵头找我绘制了一个产品思维地图，随书附赠。前阵子又遇到有朋友在翻这张地图，我自己看后，觉得惭愧，做得还不够好。另外这段时间也有新的输入，感觉是可以重新迭代一版的。于是就动手重制了一个新的产品思维地图。重制后，又跟少楠反复讨论，他也补充了不少有价值的内容，算是我们共同的作品。
