**Wikimedia (The Folks Behind Wikipedia) Are Adopting Vue.js**  
https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T241180  
Wikimedia will be using Vue for their future front-end development, but no, Wikipedia is not becoming an SPA! This post digs into the how and why of the decision, while on Twitter, Vue.js creator Evan You [explains more from his side](https://twitter.com/youyuxi/status/1240635308141613056). Hacker News had [a very busy thread](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22625556) on the topic too. 另附：[You probably don't need a single-page application](https://plausible.io/blog/you-probably-dont-need-a-single-page-app).

**Please consider not adopting Google WebComponents**  
https://forum.palemoon.org/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=24004  
https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22604070  
Dear Web Developer(s), While, as a software developer ourselves, we understand very well that new features are exciting to use and integrate into your work, we ask that you please consider not adopting Google WebComponents in your designs. This is especially important if you are a web developer creating frameworks for websites to use. With Google WebComponents here we mean the use of CustomElements and Shadow DOM, especially when used in combination, and in dynamically created document structures (e.g. using module loading/unloading and/or slotted elements). 另附两个浏览器相关的：[The reckless, infinite scope of web browsers](https://drewdevault.com/2020/03/18/Reckless-limitless-scope.html), [Things you can do with a browser in 2020](https://github.com/luruke/browser-2020).

**How to do effective video calls**  
https://martinfowler.com/articles/effective-video-calls.html  
During 2011-2012 there was a small but significant revolution in how we worked at ThoughtWorks. When we needed to communicate while separated we used to do telephone meetings, but within a year the telephone disappeared and we started using video calls instead. As we got more comfortable with video, we took more opportunity to collaborate with video meetings rather than trying to get everyone together in one place. Now the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (Covid-19) has struck, a lot more people are getting acquainted with remote working and the video calls that come with them. So I thought I'd share some of things I, and my colleagues, have learned about doing them.

**7.9.0 Released: Smaller preset-env output, Typescript 3.8 support and a new JSX transform**  
https://babeljs.io/blog/2020/03/16/7.9.0  
While preparing the Babel 8.0.0 release (in the next months), we just finished working on a new minor release which includes updates related to @babel/preset-env, TypeScript 3.8, Flow, and JSX!

**An Interactive Introduction to AntV**  
https://observablehq.com/@jiazhewang/introduction-to-antv

**进无止境，AntV 统计图表 G2Plot 1.0 发布**  
https://www.yuque.com/antv/blog/igfe4h  
G2Plot 是一个开箱即用、易于配置、体验优雅的统计图表库，致力于帮助用户以最小成本生成高质量统计图表。 G2Plot 最初诞生于阿里经济体 BI 产品真实场景的业务诉求。动态、高度不确定是 BI 产品和中台系统业务数据的一个普遍特征，而这种特征对统计图表的功能和体验提出了巨大的挑战。如何能够帮助报表系统和一线前端在复杂数据条件下快速高效地创建统计图表，同时保证图表在各种显示空间和数据状态下的可读性和可用性？ 为解决这两个痛点问题，AntV 与 DeepInsight、QuickBI 和 FBI，阿里经济体三个优秀 BI 产品技术团队联手打造了 G2Plot。自去年 11 月发布 0.x 试用版后，G2Plot 经历了 20 多个小版本的迭代优化，图表类型已从最常用的 7 个扩展到 40 多个，在核心 BI 产品真实场景上线验证后终于带来 1.0 正式版。希望我们在数据可视化业务，特别是 BI 产品中的开发和设计经验能够帮助到更多用户轻松制作优雅的统计图表。

**前后端一体化：前后端分离将死**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/s7MwTrP-bsrlUAco1vNGTw  
在所有的引子里， 我们已经准备了所有的论据，所以只需要：  
- 使用可以跨前后端的语言，构建领域模型  
- 将后端服务、前端设施细化为更小的组件  
- 设计 DSL 将领域模型转换到特定平台的代码  
你就可以杀死前后端分离，就是这么简单。前后端分离将死，不是现在，但是可能在五年后开始。你说呢？

**How to Use WordPress with React to Build a Modern Web App**  
https://snipcart.com/blog/reactjs-wordpress-rest-api-example  
WordPress REST API is a huge step forward for frontend developers looking to combine the power of JavaScript frameworks like React (or Vue.js) with WordPress. This is exactly what I want to do today with this demo of the WordPress REST API in the work. I'll use WordPress as a backend, and the REST API to feed data into a React app.

**‘CSS X’**  
https://www.w3.org/blog/2020/03/css-x/  
CSS development started some 25 years ago. Originally the goal was to provide some good but simple typography for a single column of text with the occasional image. But the technology proved popular, and flexible enough that the scope could be made much wider. And since then the work of adding new capabilities hasn’t stopped. CSS now handles multiple columns, vertical text, diagonal text, layout for graphical user interfaces, image operations, animations, some key and mouse interaction, and more.

**Neumorphism and CSS**  
https://css-tricks.com/neumorphism-and-css/  
Neumorphism (aka neomorphism) is a relatively new design trend and a term that’s gotten a good amount of buzz lately. It’s aesthetic is marked by minimal and real-looking UI that’s sort of a new take on skeuomorphism — hence the name. It got its name in a UX Collective post from December 2019, and since then, various design and development communities have been actively discussing the trend, usually with differing opinions. 

**Do You Really Understand the Viewport**  
https://hackernoon.com/do-you-really-understand-the-viewport-lv663ye4  
If you are a web developer, you must have heard about viewport, and the below line may seem familiar to you. `<meta name=”viewport” content=”width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />`. But do you really understand what this line of code actually does?

**Creating a Pencil Effect in SVG**  
https://heredragonsabound.blogspot.com/2020/02/creating-pencil-effect-in-svg.html  
Dragons Abound produces maps in SVG, which is a vector graphics format.  Vector graphics have a lot of features (such as lossless zoom) that are nice for maps. 

**Rendering charts with OffscreenCanvas**  
https://blog.scottlogic.com/2020/03/19/offscreen-canvas.html  
Rendering charts can be a very intensive operation for the browser, especially multiple charting widgets in the context of a wider application. OffscreenCanvas is growing in browser support and allows canvas rendering to be delegated to a WebWorker. This post looks at what performance improvements we can realistically expect and some gotchas that can crop up along the way.

**The Rise of the No-Code Movement**  
https://www.sitepoint.com/the-rise-of-the-no-code-movement/  
Over the past couple of years, the rise of the no-code movement has started to change the landscape of tech. Ironically, Lamdba School itself is a product of the no-code movement, building its MVP (that has served 3,000 students) using a combination of tools such as Typeform, Airtable, and Retool. The no-code movement has also been called low code or visual development. The makers of no-code platforms are still discussing the best label for the movement but for now, I will stick with ‘no-code’.

**Serverless in the wild: characterizing and optimising the serverless workload at a large cloud provider**  
https://blog.acolyer.org/2020/03/20/serverless-in-the-wild/  
Today’s paper analyses serverless workloads on Azure (the characterisation of those workloads is interesting in its own right), where users want fast function start times (avoiding cold starts), and the cloud provider wants to minimise resources consumed (costs).

**Abstractions and serverless**  
https://blog.softwaremill.com/abstractions-and-serverless-3dfaccaf85b6  
IT systems are inherently hard to comprehend. That’s why we divide systems into smaller pieces. If this division is done properly, instead of understanding everything about a system, we only need to understand each piece in isolation, and how the small pieces are composed. Performing the division “properly” is obviously not trivial, and is the crux of the problem, which we’ve been studying for quite some time.

**How event-driven architecture solves modern web app problems**  
https://stackoverflow.blog/2020/03/16/how-event-driven-architecture-solves-modern-web-app-problems/  
In this article, we’ll discuss some of the problems driving innovation in modern web development. Then we’ll dive into the basics of event-driven architecture (EDA), which tries to address these problems by thinking about back-end architecture in a novel way.

**Ways to Compute Pi in SQL**  
https://www.memsql.com/blog/ways-to-compute-pi-in-sql/  
In celebration of Pi Day, I asked MemSQL’s Engineering team to come up with clever ways to compute pi in SQL. Because that’s the kind of thing we engineers enjoy! And, given pi’s privileged status in mathematical history – and my own history of earning a bachelor’s degree in Mathematics – I just couldn’t resist.

**Activists created a 12.5 million block digital library in 'Minecraft' to bypass censorship laws (MSFT)**  
https://www.pulse.com.gh/bi/tech/activists-created-a-125-million-block-digital-library-in-minecraft-to-bypass/bn4gpcc  
Reporters Without Borders created "The Uncensored Library" within "Minecraft" as what it calls a "loophole to overcome censorship." The digital library in an open "Minecraft" server has articles and information that has been censored in many countries, but is accessible through the game. RSF said that it chose "Minecraft" because it is available in many more places than sensitive information likely to be censored. For example, Yulia Berezovskaia, editor-in-chief of the Russian news site grani.ru, which is blocked in Russia, said she's working with RSF to republish articles from her website on "Minecraft."

**Bonnaroo Music & Arts Festival: Site Redesign**  
https://uxplanet.org/bonnaroo-music-arts-festival-site-redesign-7deac38e1617  
In this 2.5 week project, assigned by Ironhack — Amsterdam, I worked solo to design a festival website with a one-year life cycle. The one-year cycle included three stages: pre-event, during event, and post-event. My primary focus was on the pre-event (hype and ticket sales) stage. Relating my design to the existing brand identity and site history was a key requirement of the final design.

https://blog.prototypr.io/my-thoughts-on-framer-x-81abd13bcdf7  
I started my first ever co-op internship this past winter as a UI/UX designer at a fin-tech company. In short, I joined when the company was at a huge overhaul, the design team being no exception. Originally using Sketch to design and InVision to prototype, the team was interested in integrating a new design tool to their belt, Framer X, “a lightning fast interactive design tool” that could hopefully fulfill our needs for both. I took some time to play around with Framer and present my findings with the team.
