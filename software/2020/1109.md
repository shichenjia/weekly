**Technical debt as a lack of understanding**  
https://daverupert.com/2020/11/technical-debt-as-a-lack-of-understanding/  
If you develop a program for a long period of time by only adding features but never reorganizing it to reflect your understanding of those features, then eventually that program simply does not contain any understanding and all efforts to work on it take longer and longer.

**7GUIs: A GUI Programming Benchmark**  
https://eugenkiss.github.io/7guis/  
There are countless GUI toolkits in different languages and with diverse approaches to GUI development. Yet, diligent comparisons between them are rare. Whereas in a traditional benchmark competing implementations are compared in terms of their resource consumption, here implementations are compared in terms of their notation. To that end, 7GUIs defines seven tasks that represent typical challenges in GUI programming. In addition, 7GUIs provides a recommended set of evaluation dimensions.

**What's the deal with SvelteKit?**  
https://svelte.dev/blog/whats-the-deal-with-sveltekit  
We're rethinking how to build Svelte apps. Here's what you need to know. Releated: [The Next Svelte May Be Serverless-First -- Rich Harris at Svelte Summit](https://www.infoq.com/news/2020/10/svelte-next-serverless-first/).

**Why not use GraphQL?**  
https://wundergraph.com/blog/why_not_use_graphql  
Hypermedia APIs played and still play a big role for server rendered web applications. However, the web is moving forward. Users expect an experience as native as it could be from websites. The Jamstack is taking over on the frontend. Hybrid models with server side rendering and dynamic Javascript clients are the enablers of these applications. RESTful APIs excel at a different set of problems. They will not go away, quite the opposite! They’re just not the right tool for this style of applications the industry is currently shifting towards. I think REST APIs are a perfect tool for internal APIs, partner APIs and server to server communication. This is an area where GraphQL doesn’t really bring any benefits over REST. Alongside RPC it will have a great future in this area. GraphQL on the other hand is more than happy to wrap resource- and RPC-based APIs.

**Adobe XD for Visual Studio Code - Create and consume Design System Packages**  
https://letsxd.com/vscode  
Design systems are the link between Design and Development. To build a successful, tailored, and widely-adopted system, both designers and developers need to have a seat at the table. The new Adobe XD extension for Visual Studio Code allows developers to visually map design sources, created in XD and available in Creative Cloud Libraries, to platform-specific code using design tokens. DesignOps teams will be able to create shareable Design System Packages (DSPs) that contain all the information developers need to consume while coding, including code snippets and documentation.

**Utility vs usability**  
https://drewdevault.com/2020/11/06/Utility-vs-usability.html  
There are two attributes to consider when classifying these tools: utility and usability. These are not the same thing. Some tools have both high utility and high usability, such as a pencil. Some are highly usable, but of low utility, such as a child’s tricycle. Tools of both low-utility and low-usability are uncommon, but I’m sure you can think of a few examples from your own experiences :)

**The JavaScript Self-Profiling API**  
https://addyosmani.com/blog/js-self-profiling/  
This API allows web developers to efficiently identify costly hotspots during page load and user-interactions in their JavaScript. The API also enables you can do things like allocate CPU budgets to individual features implemented on a page, find low-priority code that's executing in the background and wasting power or just client-side work that's unnecessary.

**Pros and cons of the SPA**  
https://stackoverflow.blog/2020/11/06/podcast-284-pros-and-cons-of-the-spa/  
In this episode we discuss the rise of the Single Page Application, or SPA. From humble beginnings around 2003, it has come to be a dominant approach for many large tech companies and an alluring option for smaller startups. But for simpler web projects, are there better alternatives? Pawel Skolski wrote this definition of the SPA in…

**我的前端成长之路：内观自在，外观世音，追寻内心平静**  
https://juejin.im/post/6889239308201361416  
一路走来虽然时常会反思自己成长道路的关键节点，以及判断和选择，但很少会落到纸上，一方面因为自认尚算年轻，阅历不多；另一方面人生没有大起大落、跌宕起伏的经历，缺乏故事感，不过是平凡人过着平凡的生活。这次很荣幸收到邀稿，借这个机会，梳理一下进入互联网行业、成为一名前端开发道路上的那些转折点，于我个人而言是个内观的机会；如果能给在看本文的你引起一些共鸣、带来一些输入，那更是甚好。

**JavaScript 恩仇录**  
https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/271845144  
JavaScript(下文简称 JS )是 目前最为流行的编程语言之一，在计算机的世界里它也是一个软件。如今，我们使用它编写页面和数据交互逻辑、搭建组件库、实现可视化效果和各种算法等等。StackOverflow 联合创始人 Jeff Atwood 曾说: “所有能用 JS 实现的，最终都将使用 JS 实现”[1]，目前来看似乎已经得到了部分的证实。同其他同类一样，作为一门编程语言性质的软件，JS 有 bug、也会倒排赶工期、经历迭代，还有来自“老板”的需求，甚至还有多部门共建时搞出了一堆问题的情况。今天，和大家一起扒一扒这段曲折精彩的历史。

**3x Smaller Lambda Artifacts by Removing Junk From node_modules**  
https://itnext.io/3x-smaller-lambda-artifacts-by-removing-junk-from-node-modules-2b50780ca1f5  
Reducing artifact size proportionally correlates with the cold start latency. The most obvious way would be to use webpack and do tree shaking. But I’m not a fan of that approach. It’s cumbersome to set up and has significant dev effort, especially when you face issues with bundling some backend dependencies.

**Is the Internet Different?**  
https://stratechery.com/2020/is-the-internet-different/  
More broadly, the pre-Internet world, governed as it was by gatekeepers, was certainly a more unified one, at least as far as conventional wisdom was concerned — this applied to law and economics just as much as anything else. At the same time, that does not mean the pre-Internet world had a better overarching grasp on the truth, given how much more difficult it was for dissenting voices to gain distribution. If I happen to be correct about Aggregation Theory, and that the way to understand Google depends on more than “two-sided market theory with some positive feedback loop stuff thrown in”, then I would like to think the fact that Stratechery can exist, without anyone’s permission, is a good thing.

**Data is not the new oil: a call for a Butlerian Jihad against technocrat data ding dongs**  
https://scottlocklin.wordpress.com/2020/11/05/data-is-not-the-new-oil-a-call-for-a-butlerian-jihad-against-technocratic-ding-dongs/  
I tire of the dialog on “big data” and “AI.” AI is an actual subject, but as used in marketing and press releases and in the babbling by ideologues and think tank dipshits, the term is a sort of grandiose malapropism meaning “statistics and machine learning.” As far as I can tell “big data” just means the data at one point lived in something other than a spreadsheet.

eBird began with a simple idea—that every birdwatcher has unique knowledge and experience. Our goal is to gather this information in the form of checklists of birds, archive it, and freely share it to power new data-driven approaches to science, conservation and education. At the same time, we develop tools that make birding more rewarding. From being able to manage lists, photos and audio recordings, to seeing real-time maps of species distribution, to alerts that let you know when species have been seen, we strive to provide the most current and useful information to the birding community.
