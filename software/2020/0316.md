**GitLab's Guide to All-Remote**  
https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/guide/  
GitLab is the world's largest all-remote company with over 1,200 team members located in more than 65 countries around the world. On this page and subpages, we'll share what "all-remote" really means, how it works at GitLab, some tips and tricks for remote teams, and resources to learn more. 

**How Websites Evolved Back to Static HTML/CSS/JS Files**  
https://paramaggarwal.substack.com/p/how-websites-evolved-back-to-static-html-css-js-files-57ce549f81db  
https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22519090  
I find it fascinating that we are back to generating separate HTML/CSS and JS files and then putting them on a static file server — the CDN. It has been a decade long effort and as we come back to where we started, I feel like we are at a whole another level (a spiral?). At the end of the day, the output remains the same, but we have much more sophisticated tooling similar to many other things in life. Imagine the complexity involved in converting your voice into bits and transmitting it over a combination of wires and air spectrum to reach the other person contrary to the past where we would just travel and meet people. Over time the outcome remains the same, but by introducing complexity and then effectively abstracting it away, we are able to accomplish things indistinguisable from magic.

**Why Svelte is our choice for a large web project in 2020**  
https://github.com/feltcoop/why-svelte  
Svelte is a JavaScript framework for building user interfaces. Its compiler architecture enables amazing tradeoffs for UX and DX. Svelte might be worth your attention, especially if you pine for the web of yore and future.

**We made SQL visual - why and how**  
https://chartio.com/blog/why-we-made-sql-visual-and-how-we-finally-did-it/  
we’re excited to announce that we have—through thousands of design iterations, dozens of functioning prototypes, several hundred user tests, and countless hours of development—created an interface that truly enables the business user to work with data. We call the interface [Visual SQL](https://chartio.com/product/visual-sql/). 另附：[数据管理与可视化分析平台，DataGear 1.6.1 发布](https://www.toutiao.com/i6802413958025183756/).

**Ready for changes with Hexagonal Architecture**  
https://netflixtechblog.com/ready-for-changes-with-hexagonal-architecture-b315ec967749  
We needed to support the ability to swap data sources without impacting business logic, so we knew we needed to keep them decoupled. We decided to build our app based on principles behind Hexagonal Architecture. The idea of Hexagonal Architecture is to put inputs and outputs at the edges of our design. Business logic should not depend on whether we expose a REST or a GraphQL API, and it should not depend on where we get data from — a database, a microservice API exposed via gRPC or REST, or just a simple CSV file. The best part of Hexagonal Architecture is that it keeps our application flexible for future requirements to come.

**前端页面仔的祖传技术 JS 终于有史书了**  
https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/113079856  
我说的是真正的史学……屌炸天的 190 页 JS 历史论文： [JavaScript: The First 20 Years](http://www.wirfs-brock.com/allen/posts/866)
，这篇论文属于即将在 6 月召开的第四届『编程语言历史大会』（HOPL），这个活动每隔十几年才举办一次。

**有赞零售中台建设方法的探索与实践**  
https://tech.youzan.com/zhong-tai-jian-she-fang-fa/  
有赞的技术博客这周分享了大量实践成果，这是其中一篇。有赞零售SaaS业务整体业务架构概览，大体上可以分为前台业务、中台业务、后台业务。前台业务主要是面向前端消费者，包含全渠道销售、各业务单元的商品、订单、会员、营销、进销存、智能导购等业务。前台业务的特点是变化快、差异性大；细节性体验、综合性体验；跨平台、多触点。中台业务承担承上启下、数据打通、业务单元协同的职责。后台业务主要是面向企业的业务，包括企业内部成熟、稳定的业务，例如生产制造、供应链管理、财务总账等。

**你以为文言编程只是闹着玩？三个月后，人家IDE、教程、包管理器都有了**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/8HvF5GU9iWdvhiX-TlqjkA  
用文言文写的官方编程教程《文言陰符》，类似 pip 那样的包管理工具「文淵閣」，还有文言编程开源 IDE「文言齋」，文言编程语言已经这么成熟了？

**React Single File Components Are Here**  
https://www.swyx.io/writing/react-sfcs-here/  
The launch of [RedwoodJS](https://redwoodjs.com/) today marks a first: it is the first time React components are being expressed in a single file format with explicit conventions. I first talked about this in relation to my post on React Distros, but I think React SFCs will reach standardization in the near future and it is worth discussing now as a standalone post.

**BEM CSS in React**  
https://levelup.gitconnected.com/bem-css-in-react-e0d4a4721872  
In this post, I aim to answer two questions: What is BEM? How should BEM be applied to styling React components? BEM is an acronym for Block Element Modifier. It’s not a framework or library. It is but a small piece of a larger CSS architecture puzzle. Specifically, BEM is a strict CSS selector naming convention that provides a valuable mental model for component composition.  

**How I made a 3D game in only 2KB of JavaScript**  
http://frankforce.com/?p=7427  
Months ago, when I heard that the legendary JS1k game jam would not be continuing, I talked it over with some other devs and decided to help fill the void we would host [a 2k game jam on itch called 2kPlus Jam](https://itch.io/jam/2kplus-jam). The primary goal of this comp was to create a game that fits entirely in a 2 kilobyte zip file. That is incredibly small, for point of reference a 3.5 floppy disk could hold over 700 of these games.

**Choosing the Right Database for Your Applications**  
https://pingcap.com/success-stories/choosing-right-database-for-your-applications/  
Shopee is the leading e-commerce platform in Southeast Asia and Taiwan. It is a platform tailored for the region, providing customers with an easy, secure, and fast online shopping experience through strong payment and logistical support. There are so many databases available in the market. How do you choose the right one? In this post, I'll share our thoughts with you. I hope this post can help you when you're comparing multiple databases and looking for the right fit for your application.

**Defunctionalisation – an underappreciated tool for writing good software**  
https://www.gresearch.co.uk/article/defunctionalisation/  
We have talked about “initial algebras” at some length; this post is to discuss defunctionalisation as a complementary technique. Defunctionalisation is a well-known technique among compiler writers, but I consider it to be under-appreciated as a tool for writing good software more generally. It pairs up particularly well with the “initial algebra” pattern.

**The Life of a Data Byte**  
https://blog.jessfraz.com/post/the-life-of-a-data-byte/  
In this issue we move from URLs to mere bytes. This is a fun trip through time of various storage technologies and how bits and bytes have formed our storage world.

**Retail Graph — Walmart’s Product Knowledge Graph**  
https://medium.com/walmartlabs/retail-graph-walmarts-product-knowledge-graph-6ef7357963bc  
At Walmart we are working on building a Retail Graph that captures the knowledge about product and its related entities to help our customers better discover products in our catalog. It’s a product knowledge graph that can answer questions about products and related knowledge in the retail context.​ Such a system can be used to power semantic search, recommendation system etc. This article further expounds on what is Retail Graph, how we built it, tech choices around graph model, db and some use cases.

**Announcing mobile first indexing for the whole web**  
https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2020/03/announcing-mobile-first-indexing-for.html  
It's been a few years now that Google started working on mobile-first indexing - Google's crawling of the web using a smartphone Googlebot. From our analysis, most sites shown in search results are good to go for mobile-first indexing, and 70% of those shown in our search results have already shifted over. To simplify, we'll be switching to mobile-first indexing for all websites starting September 2020. In the meantime, we'll continue moving sites to mobile-first indexing when our systems recognize that they're ready.

Inside of a sandbox, dangerzone converts the document to a PDF (if it isn't already one), and then converts the PDF into raw pixel data: a huge list of of RGB color values for each page. Then, in a separate sandbox, dangerzone takes this pixel data and converts it back into a PDF.

**From 2D To 3D Illustration – Design Trend**  
https://www.themasterpicks.com/from-2d-to-3d-illustration/  
We have seen quite a few styles and trends of illustration such as isometric illustration, Abstract, Broken Proportions, Surrealistic characters and more. Now we can see the beginning of something new and fresh, a transition from 2D to 3D illustration.

**The Psychology of Color and Emotional Design**  
https://www.uxbooth.com/articles/the-psychology-of-color-and-emotional-design/  
Every so often psychologists change their minds about what drives human behavior. Early in my career, psychologists claimed that people made rational decisions. Today, thanks to neuroscience, the prevailing view is that we make irrational, emotionally-driven decisions.

**School’s Out… Or Is It?**  
http://blog.archive.org/2020/03/11/schools-out-or-is-it/  
The Internet Archive’s mission is Universal Access to All Knowledge, and that includes making it possible for anyone to receive a quality education, anytime, anywhere.

**Do whatever you can't stop thinking about**  
https://shime.sh/do-whatever-you-can%27t-stop-thinking-about  
Another useful tool, for deciding what to work on is the Regret Minimization Framework: Project yourself being 80 years old and thinking whether you would regret your current decision. That's how Jeff Bezos decided to work on Amazon. It's a useful tool for prioritizing over long-term and rationalizing decisions that make no sense in the short-term. Never work on anything you would regret looking back on your deathbed and spend as much time you can on doing whatever you can’t stop thinking about.

**电子工程师也有“鄙视链”！软件硬件无一幸免！**

自古以来，文人相轻，而这股风气如今也在电子工程师的圈子里蔓延开来，影响者众多。从程序语言、工具、OS、硬件、到职场，根据你所学东西的不同，被划分为不同的阵营。仿佛是文人特有的傲气在作祟，出于对所学东西的坚持，对其他东西的轻视，分属不同阵营的人都鄙视来鄙视去，甚至形成一条鄙视链，不过最后发现也就只剩下自己才不鄙视自己。想知道工程师的鄙视链到底有多惨烈，看完本文你就懂了，一定会吓坏不少小伙伴的。
