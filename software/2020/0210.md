**Old CSS, new CSS**  
https://eev.ee/blog/2020/02/01/old-css-new-css/  
I first got into web design/development in the late 90s, and only as I type this sentence do I realize how long ago that was. And boy, it was horrendous. I mean, being able to make stuff and put it online where other people could see it was pretty slick, but we did not have very much to work with. I’ve been taking for granted that most folks doing web stuff still remember those days, or at least the decade that followed, but I think that assumption might be a wee bit out of date. Some time ago I encountered a tweet marvelling at what we had to do without border-radius. I still remember waiting with bated breath for it to be unprefixed! But then, I suspect I also know a number of folks who only tried web design in the old days, and assume nothing about it has changed since. I’m here to tell all of you to get off my lawn. Here’s a history of CSS and web design, as I remember it. 另附：[CSS4 is a Bad Idea](https://www.impressivewebs.com/css4-bad-idea/).

**What is SAP**

ERP is where companies store their core operational data. We’re talking about sales projections, purchase orders, and inventory, as well as the processes that act upon that data (e.g. paying out vendors when a purchase order is issued). In a sense, ERP is the “brain” of a company — it stores all important pieces of data and all of the actions possible in data-driven workflows. But before taking over the modern business world, how did ERP software get started? The story of ERP begins with major automation efforts of the 1960s: while the 1940s and 50s were focused on mechanical automation of blue collar work — think General Motors establishing their automation department in 1947 — the automation of white collar work (often via the computer!) began in the 1960s.

**Webix - Declarative UI Framework for Rapid Development - Interview with Maksim Kozhukh**  
https://survivejs.com/blog/webix-interview/  
If there's something that has changed during the past few years, it's the way we develop user interfaces using JavaScript. Earlier we've learned about solutions, such as Reakit. Now it's time to look into a library designed especially for rapid prototyping. I'm interviewing Maksim Kozhukh from Webix to learn more about their approach.

**Micro-Frontend Composition Patterns**

Design patterns to help you build micro frontends effectively.

**Does your web app need a front-end framework?**  
https://stackoverflow.blog/2020/02/03/is-it-time-for-a-front-end-framework/  
You’ve likely heard about front-end frameworks. Names like React, Vue, and Angular abound in tutorials and Hacker News debates. If you’ve wondered why and when these frameworks are used and whether it’s time you implement one in your project, you’re not alone. A few years ago, while working on a side project, Hackterms, my own...

**You don't (may not) need Moment.js**  
https://github.com/you-dont-need/You-Dont-Need-Momentjs  
Moment.js is a fantastic time & date library with lots of great features and utilities. However, if you are working on a performance sensitive web application, it might cause a huge performance overhead because of its complex APIs and large bundle size.

**Redesign: Gridniking**  
https://frankchimero.com/blog/2020/gridniking/  
Making grids sits somewhere between sharpening axes and solving puzzles, part prep work, part game. Some designers are obsessed with grids, and I can understand the appeal. There are enough details that you can get lost in it, and what you produce becomes a tool, an investment. Dividing space is indeed one of the principle tasks of design, and grids offer a way to structure that work. All the same, designs placed on super intricate grid systems can feel a little…sterile? Micromanaged? Over-built? Those aren’t quite the right words, but I think you know what I mean. There is a point where a grid system becomes too elaborate and loses its finesse. The structures that are meant to support creative choices can become a cage. I’m a big proponent of “just enough grid.” Grids are scaffolding, structures meant to help get the main building done. There is no need to overbuild, especially for this site. I am going to stay organized, but only just so.

**The State of Serverless - Datadog**  
https://www.datadoghq.com/state-of-serverless/  
“Serverless” may be a buzzword, but it's not an empty one. Less than five years since it launched, AWS Lambda has already been adopted by nearly half of companies with infrastructure in AWS. In this report, we examine the serverless usage of thousands of companies to provide a look at how (and how much) serverless is being used in the real world.

**Things I Believe About Software Engineering**  
https://blog.wesleyac.com/posts/engineering-beliefs  
Inspired by [Jan Stette's "Things I Believe" post](https://gist.github.com/stettix/5bb2d99e50fdbbd15dd9622837d14e2b), I decided to write down some of the more contentious beliefs I have about software engineering. I've selected some of my more extreme opinions here, so I expect reasonable people to disagree with me.

**A new hash algorithm for Git**  
https://lwn.net/SubscriberLink/811068/cfeb6a67b8dfbe47/  
The Git source-code management system is famously built on the SHA‑1 hashing algorithm, which has become an increasingly weak foundation over the years. SHA‑1 is now considered to be broken and, despite the fact that it does not yet seem to be so broken that it could be used to compromise Git repositories, users are increasingly worried about its security. The good news is that work on moving Git past SHA‑1 has been underway for some time, and is slowly coming to fruition; there is a version of the code that can be looked at now.

**Why Discord is switching from Go to Rust**  
https://blog.discordapp.com/why-discord-is-switching-from-go-to-rust-a190bbca2b1f  
Rust is becoming a first class language in a variety of domains. At Discord, we’ve seen success with Rust on the client side and server side. For example, we use it on the client side for our video encoding pipeline for Go Live and on the server side for Elixir NIFs. Most recently, we drastically improved the performance of a service by switching its implementation from Go to Rust. This post explains why it made sense for us to reimplement the service, how it was done, and the resulting performance improvements.

https://blog.npmjs.org/post/190665497245/a-day-in-the-life-of-npm-security  
The JavaScript ecosystem is a lush, fertile, mostly beneficent garden. But even the best gardens need some tending. Much of that tending comes in the form of the continuous research on the part of the npm security team mated with their automated processes behind the scenes at npm, Inc. when new packages are published. Another crucial element is the vigilance of the JavaScript community at large looking for and reporting potential vulnerabilities of packages in the registry. The net effect of this widely-scoped vigilance is an inbox chock full of vulnerability reports that must be addressed every day.

**React Libraries in 2020**  
https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-libraries  
React only enables you to build component driven user interfaces with function components and props. It comes with a couple of built-in solutions though, for instance, React Hooks for local state and side-effects. But after all you are only dealing with components here. The following article will give you an opinionated approach to select from complementary libraries to build a well-rounded React application. It's up to you to exchange them with your choices. 另附：[React v6.0.0-alpha](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router/releases/tag/v6.0.0-alpha.0).

**The Missing Semester of Your CS Education**  
https://missing.csail.mit.edu/  
Classes teach you all about advanced topics within CS, from operating systems to machine learning, but there’s one critical subject that’s rarely covered, and is instead left to students to figure out on their own: proficiency with their tools. We’ll teach you how to master the command-line, use a powerful text editor, use fancy features of version control systems, and much more! Students spend hundreds of hours using these tools over the course of their education (and thousands over their career), so it makes sense to make the experience as fluid and frictionless as possible. Mastering these tools not only enables you to spend less time on figuring out how to bend your tools to your will, but it also lets you solve problems that would previously seem impossibly complex.
