**What is CSS4?**  
https://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2020/02/what_is_css4.html  
https://css-tricks.com/css4-update/  
If we want [CSS4 to be a thing](https://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2020/01/css4_is_here.html) it is necessary to define it a little more. However, that does not mean it’s necessary to divide all existing CSS modules into CSS3 and CSS4 buckets. This article discusses these issues, and goes through some of the feedback to my original article.

**Why JavaScript is Eating HTML**  
https://css-tricks.com/why-javascript-is-eating-html/  
As a JavaScript developer on a cross-functional team, I get this question occasionally and I often have trouble answering it. All of the materials I’ve found on this topic are written for an audience that is already familiar with JavaScript — which is not terribly useful to those who focus on HTML and CSS. But this HTML-in-JS pattern (or something else that provides the same benefits) will likely be around for a while, so I think it’s an important thing that everyone involved in web development should understand. This article will include code examples for those interested, but my goal is to explain this concept in a way that can be understood without them.

**Why is swc fast?**  
https://swc-project.github.io/blog/2020/02/16/why-is-swc-fast.html  
swc is fast. Very fast. It's 18x faster than babel on a single-core benchmark, and on a parallel benchmark, it's 68x faster than babel on a 4 core (8 HT) machine. Why? Just because it's written in rust? No. Its fundamental design differs from any other tool. 另附：[esbuild - An extremely fast JavaScript bundler and minifier written in Go](https://github.com/evanw/esbuild).

**IPFS Project Focus for 2020**  
https://blog.ipfs.io/2020-02-10-our-focus-for-2020/  
“The mission of IPFS is to create a resilient, upgradeable, open network to preserve and grow humanity’s knowledge.” It’s a new year, and with it time to update the IPFS Project Roadmap with our focus for 2020. As part of that, we also want to reflect on our successes, challenges, and learnings from 2019 to help us stay on track to achieve our mission, and maximize the value and utility we create in the world.

**7 really good reasons not to use TypeScript**  
https://medium.com/javascript-in-plain-english/7-really-good-reasons-not-to-use-typescript-166af597c466  
Everyone loves TypeScript. It “solves” many problems JS has, it is a “superset” of JS, it will make your code error-prone and pleasant to read. There are a lot of good reasons to use TypeScript, but I am going to give you 7 really good reasons not to.

**G6 3.3 性能战斗机解析**  
https://www.yuque.com/antv/blog/wqas6s  
图——实体与关系的集合，往往具有庞大的数据量。最常见的图可视化将关系数据绘制为大量节点和边元素，而每一个元素也可能由多种图形复合而成，例如最为常见的带文本节点。图元素的样式变化万千，渲染、交互性能一直是关系数据可视化中最为棘手问题之一。特别是在前端计算资源有限的情况下，如何提升图可视化的性能，成为 G6 一大难题。2020 年伊始，我们终于向着这一难题跨出了第一步 —— 性能卓越的 G6 3.3 正式发布。让我们一睹性能战斗机的究竟吧。

**React Hooks的体系设计之一 - 分层**  
https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/106665408  
React内置的hook提供了基础的能力，虽然本质上它也有一些分层，比如：useState是基于useReducer的简化版。useMemo和useCallback事实上可以基于useRef实现。但在实际应用时，我们可以将这些统一视为一层，即最基础的底层。因此，如果我们在实际的应用开发中，单纯地在组件里组合使用内置的hook，无疑是一种不分层的粗暴使用形式，这仅仅在表象上使用了hook，而无法基于hook达到逻辑复用的目标。

**得到 Hybrid 架构的演进之路**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/TsFGkLeOMGloa-0bs_5PuA  
得到 APP 是一个三年多的产品，最初采用纯 Native 的方式开发，在 18 年初，我们开始了 Hybyid 开发技术方案的探索和实践， 目前得到 APP 共包含了 ReactNative 和 Webview 两套 Hybrid 方案。本文从时间维度上，重点回顾一下 Webview Hybrid 方案在得到 APP 从 0 到 1 的过程，也希望我们的经历可以给一些想落地 Hybrid 方案的团队一点启发。

**美团外卖持续交付的前世今生**  
https://tech.meituan.com/2020/02/13/meituan-waimai-continuous-delivery.html  
美团外卖自2013年创建以来，业务一直在高速发展，目前日订单量已突破3000万单，已成为美团点评最重要的业务之一。美团外卖所承载的业务，从早期单一的美食业务发展成为了外卖平台业务。目前除餐饮业务外，闪购、跑腿、闪付、营销、广告等产品形态的业务也陆续在外卖平台上线。参与到美团外卖平台的业务团队，也从早期的单一的外卖团队发展成为多业务团队。每个业务团队虽然都有不同的业务形态，但是几乎都有相同的诉求：需求能不能尽快地上线？然而，Native应用的发布依赖于应用市场的更新，周期非常长，非常不利于产品的快速迭代、快速试错。同时，作为平台方，我们需要考虑到各个业务团队的诉求，统筹考虑如何建立怎么样的模型、配套什么样的技术手段，才能实现最佳的状态，满足各业务更短周期、高质量的交付业务的诉求。本文会首先回顾美团外卖从早期的月交付，逐渐演变成双周交付，再从双周交付演变成双周版本交付配合周动态交付的过程。然后从外卖的历史实践中，浅谈一个好的持续交付需要综合考虑哪些关键因素，希望对大家有所帮助或启发。

**The state of web development on mobile**  
https://areknawo.com/the-state-of-web-development-on-mobile/  
Let me ask you a question - what kind of a machine do you code on? I bet it's one of desktop, laptop, or maybe even a remote server with SSH connection. That's the standard these days, but I think that there are some passionate (and crazy in a sense) people (like me) who'd like to stretch it even further. Those who'd like to be able to code literally anywhere, no matter what kind of a device they have available. So, is it possible to do web dev on mobile?

**How Sustainable is a Solar Powered Website**

**Where are all the animated SVGs?**  
https://www.getmotion.io/blog/where-are-all-the-animated-svgs/  
Animated SVGs just make sense. There are lots of articles explaining why you should be using SVG. There's even scientific evidence(!) that says animated icons are better than static ones. So… where are all the animated icons? Why isn’t the web filled with these amazing, accessible, performant animations? I have some ideas...

**JuliaLang: The Ingredients for a Composable Programming Language**  
https://white.ucc.asn.au/2020/02/09/whycompositionaljulia.html  
One of the most remarkable things about the julia programming language, is how well the packages compose. You can almost always reuse someone else’s types or methods in your own software without issues. This is generally taken on a high level to be true of all programming languages because that is what a library is. However, experienced software engineers often note that its surprisingly difficult in practice to take something from one project and use it in another without tweaking. But in the julia ecosystem this seems to mostly work. This post explores some theories on why; and some loose recommendations to future language designers.

**Let's Encrypt: an automated certificate authority to encrypt the entire we**  
https://blog.acolyer.org/2020/02/12/lets-encrypt-an-automated-certificate-authority-to-encrypt-the-entire-web/  
This paper tells the story of Let’s Encrypt, from it’s early beginnings in 2012/13 all the way to becoming the world’s largest HTTPS Certificate Authority (CA) today – accounting for more currently valid certificates than all other browser-trusted CAs combined. Beyond the functionality that Let’s Encrypt provides, the story stands out to me for two key ingredients. 

**The History of Git: The Road to Domination in Software Version Control**  
https://www.welcometothejungle.com/en/articles/btc-history-git  
In 2005, Linus Torvalds urgently needed a new version control system to maintain the development of the Linux Kernel. So he went offline for a week, wrote a revolutionary new system from scratch, and called it Git. Fifteen years later, the platform is the undisputed leader in a crowded field.

**AutoFlip: An Open Source Framework for Intelligent Video Reframing**  
https://ai.googleblog.com/2020/02/autoflip-open-source-framework-for.html  
[AutoFlip](https://github.com/google/mediapipe/blob/master/mediapipe/docs/autoflip.md), an open source framework for intelligent video reframing. AutoFlip is built on top of the MediaPipe framework that enables the development of pipelines for processing time-series multimodal data. Taking a video (casually shot or professionally edited) and a target dimension (landscape, square, portrait, etc.) as inputs, AutoFlip analyzes the video content, develops optimal tracking and cropping strategies, and produces an output video with the same duration in the desired aspect ratio.

Exactly two years ago, we published the first stable version of React Navigation. Throughout this time, the library has been actively developed by adding many new features and bug fixes. The essence of React Navigation was that it was a project that was to become not only a project of individual programmers adapting it to their requirements, but a community as a whole, hence the emphasis on versatility, extensibility, and the tendency to reconsider the assumptions if there were such needs. Thanks to this, the Library has been undergoing metamorphosis of both incremental and completely reorganized shape.

**让爱你的人深爱你，恨你的人远离你，这样你就能赢了**

作为任何人（任何产品、任何内容、任何公司），如何赢得自己所需的大众支持。如果你在运营一种产品、一种内容、一个平台，你应该选择“尽可能争取中立者”，尽可能扩大自己的用户基础；还是应该选择“尽可能动员基本盘”，在垂直或特色领域里面做出尽可能大的文章呢？很多应用已经证明，若能充分动员基本用户、垂直用户，那么 1 亿人可以打败 3 亿人，3000 万人可以打败1亿人，500 万人又能打败 3000万人。在收入环节尤其如此：“为爱付费”不是一句空话。这个世界上，永远有人爱你、有人恨你、有人对你没感觉。你可以说服尽可能多的人爱你，也可以说服爱你的人更爱你。最终，你可能发现：爱你的人都是你的死忠粉丝，而“恨你”的人其实也不希望你死，他们只想远离你而已。
