**低代码，要怎么低？和低代码有关的 10 个问题**  
https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/225987562  
或许是因为 Mendix 和 Outsystems 的收购及融资，还有 Gartner/Forrester 的鼓吹（Gartner 甚至预测 4 年后低代码开发会占应用开发的 65% 以上，你敢信？），这两年低代码忽然开始受到关注，不少公司在开发这方面的产品，我们也将 amis 开源项目的介绍改成了「前端低代码框架」，并推出了包含前后端的低代码平台「爱速搭」，本文将谈谈我对低代码的理解，尝试回答这个 10 问题：低代码是什么？之前是否有低代码平台？它们是怎么做的？低代码究竟能解决什么问题...

**Introducing the New JSX Transform**  
https://reactjs.org/blog/2020/09/22/introducing-the-new-jsx-transform.html  
Upgrading to the new transform is completely optional, but it has a few benefits: With the new transform, you can use JSX without importing React; Depending on your setup, its compiled output may slightly improve the bundle size; It will enable future improvements that reduce the number of concepts you need to learn React.

**Active learning machine learning: What it is and how it works**  
https://algorithmia.com/blog/active-learning-machine-learning  
Active learning is the subset of machine learning in which a learning algorithm can query a user interactively to label data with the desired outputs.

**From streaming to studio: The evolution of Node.js at Netflix**  
https://openjsf.org/blog/2020/09/24/from-streaming-to-studio-the-evolution-of-node-js-at-netflix/  
As platforms grow, so do their needs. However, the core infrastructure is often not designed to handle these new challenges as it was optimized for a relatively simple task. Netflix, a member of the OpenJS Foundation, had to overcome this challenge as it evolved from a massive web streaming service to a content production platform. Guilherme Hermeto, Senior Platform Engineer at Netflix, spearheaded efforts to restructure the Netflix Node.js infrastructure to handle new functions while preserving the stability of the application. In his talk below, he walks through his work and provides resources and tips for developers encountering similar problems.

**The Era of Visual Studio Code**  
https://blog.robenkleene.com/2020/09/21/the-era-of-visual-studio-code/  
I believe VS Code has presented extraordinary evidence. I’m hoping it moves into the category with apps like Excel, Illustrator, Photoshop, software that has held the most popular position in its category for decades. These applications are reliably time investments that repay their cost of learning over the course of a career. Emacs and Vim have always been like that, but it’s always good to have more choice.

**Node 案发现场揭秘 —— 文件句柄泄露导致进程假死**  
https://www.yuque.com/egg/nodejs/kxcncd

**不四：产品工程师的修炼之路**  
https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/259207187  
我是不四，毕业后一直在阿里和蚂蚁工作，不四是我在阿里的花名，社区中一般以另一个花名 “死马” 出现。工作这 8 年多来一直专注在 Node.js 和 Web 开发领域，也在社区参与了一些开源项目，包括 Koa、Egg 和 cnpm 等，非常幸运在 node 出生之初就开始参与其中，算是赶上了一波由 node 带来的大前端变革浪潮。每一个人的成长轨迹都不一样，一路上遇到的机遇也各不相同，这次分享也仅站在一个普通工程师的角度来分享我的成长经历和贯穿其中的一些个人习惯。

**Accessible Web Animation: The WCAG on Animation Explained**  
https://css-tricks.com/accessible-web-animation-the-wcag-on-animation-explained/  
While different contexts can affect the details of what you need to do, the WCAG provides a number of recommendations for animated content and interactions. These include guidelines for when to provide pause and play controls, limits for blinking or flashing the screen, and advice on when to provide reduced motion options for users with motion sensitivities. If you haven’t looked at it in a while, the specification has been updated to version 2.1, and now has even more useful guidance on how we can design web animations that are accessible.  Let’s dig into each of those recommendations in more detail to see how we can apply them to our work on the web.

**The failed promise of Web Components**  
https://lea.verou.me/2020/09/the-failed-promise-of-web-components/  
https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24640151  
The other day I was looking for a simple, dependency free, tabs component. You know, the canonical example of something that is easy to do with Web Components, the example 50% of tutorials mention. I didn’t even care what it looked like, it was for a testing interface. I just wanted something that is small and works like a normal HTML element. Yet, it proved so hard I ended up writing my own!

**Thinking About Power Usage and Websites**  
https://css-tricks.com/thinking-about-power-usage-and-websites/  
Jack Lenox’s article “How Improving Website Performance Can Help Save The Planet” on Smashing is a better deep dive. He points to websites that will test your site. Website Carbon Calculator is one example and it states: Calculating the carbon emissions of website is somewhat of a challenge, but using five key pieces of data we can make a pretty good estimate.

**Toward a "modern" Emacs**  
https://lwn.net/SubscriberLink/832311/03910e26a3f3e814/  
The May 2020 discussion focused on restoring the popularity that Emacs is felt to have enjoyed in the past. It could well be that there are more Emacs users now than at any time in the past but the editor's share of the total computing user base has clearly shrunk over time. The current discussion has a similar but different focus: attracting new users to Emacs, an editor that is widely seen as being outdated and as having a difficult and intimidating learning curve. The initial [thread](https://lwn.net/ml/emacs-devel/20200906133719.cu6yaldvenxubcqq@Ergus/) was started by "Ergus" on September 6 as a request to consider some changes for the Emacs 28 release. Rather than focus on new features, though, Ergus proposed making some existing features more accessible:

**易用度在企业级中后台产品的探索和实践**  
https://www.yuque.com/ant-design/ant-design/fbdqds  
作为产品设计者，经常遇到一个备受灵魂拷问的问题：怎么衡量我们设计的产品，用户体验是过关的？今年，我们在蚂蚁 CTO 线中后台产品进行尝试，发现「易用度」可以作为合适的度量指标，并成功推广到 35 个产品，帮助PD、设计师、工程师等产品设计者去衡量产品体验现状，发现改进机会点。实践证明，易用度，相比满意度、尖叫度、NPS，更适合技术类产品的体验度量。结合用户行为数据，可以为用户画像、改进方向、运营策略提供更准确的决策依据。

**Intuitive Design? No Such Thing!**  
https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/09/intuitive-design/  
“Intuitive design” is one of those overused phrases that we as designers hear all too often from stakeholders and their requirements. This article explores what intuitive design actually means, why it doesn’t make sense, how we can better approach design solutions, and what the future of interfaces might look like. It is aimed at user experience designers and anyone interested exploring these concepts in greater detail.

Content strategy at Facebook consists of equal parts UX writing, product strategy and design thinking. When I say I write “content” as a content strategist at Instagram, I mean coming up with the words that you see in the app’s user interface — including elements like buttons, titles, error messages and feature names.

**Wikipedia is getting a new look for the first time in 10 years. Here’s why.**  
https://diff.wikimedia.org/2020/09/23/wikipedia-is-getting-a-new-look-for-the-first-time-in-10-years-heres-why/  
Our first change, a collapsible sidebar, allows users to collapse the lengthy menu found on the left side of each page. This change helps improve usability and focus by allowing people to concentrate on the content itself, whether reading or editing. Our second change introduces a maximum line width to our content on pages where reading is the focus, such as article pages and discussion pages. Research has shown that limiting the width can lead to better retention of the content itself, as well as a decrease in eye strain.
