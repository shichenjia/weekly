**React v17.0**  
https://reactjs.org/blog/2020/10/20/react-v17.html  
The React 17 release is unusual because it doesn’t add any new developer-facing features. Instead, this release is primarily focused on making it easier to upgrade React itself. In particular, React 17 is a “stepping stone” release that makes it safer to embed a tree managed by one version of React inside a tree managed by a different version of React. It also makes it easier to embed React into apps built with other technologies. Releated: [What Vue.js Does Better Than React](https://hswolff.com/blog/what-vuejs-does-better-than-react/).

**Node.js v15.0.0 is here!**  
https://nodejs.medium.com/node-js-v15-0-0-is-here-deb00750f278  
Just some of the features delivered in Node.js 15: AbortController, N-API Version 7, npm 7, Throw on unhandled rejections, QUIC (experimental), V8 8.6.

**The Tyranny of Metrics**  
https://nemethgergely.com/blog/the-tyranny-of-metrics  
There seems to be a growing trend in technology--and in all aspects of our lives, really--to measure everything: business outcomes, organizational success, and individual performance. I wrote about engineering productivity and how I disagree with measuring individual performance based on metrics before, so I was excited to start reading [The Tyranny of Metrics](https://nemethgergely.com/blog/the-tyranny-of-metrics) by Jerry Z. Muller. In the book, Muller draws on both Campbell and Goodhart's expertise, then provides more insights on metrics fixation and the detrimental effects they have on our everyday life. Sometimes, the best metric is no metric.

**Solid Relevance**  
http://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2020/10/18/Solid-Relevance.html  
The SOLID principles remain as relevant to day as they were in the 90s (and indeed before that). This is because software hasn’t changed all that much in all those years — and that is because software hasn’t change all that much since 1945 when Turing wrote the first lines of code for an electronic computer. Software is still if statements, while loops, and assignment statements — Sequence, Selection, and Iteration. Every new generation likes to think that their world is vastly different from the generation before. Every new generation is wrong about that; which is something that every new generation learns once the next new generation comes along to tell them how much everything has changed. So let’s walk through the principles, one by one.

**What is Front-End Development? Necessary Web Development Job Skills Explained**  
https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-front-end-development/  
A front-end developer is someone who works on software, like desktop or mobile websites, that users interact with. Specifically, a front-end developer spends time on the side of technology that the user touches and sees.

**Introducing Figma to React**  
https://blog.prototypr.io/introducing-figma-to-react-86b0c064e984  
Figma is awesome for creating reusable UI elements and iterating fast. Features like Auto-Layout also bring it closer to the constraints present in the developer’s world. When it comes to going to production though, there’s still a gap that handoff tools fail to bridge. I have been a Front-End passionate for many years, and always dreamed that design tools could provide code in modern frameworks. So I decided to create this concept. 

**编码技巧（六）：正视代码**  
https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/268285489  
虽说开发者的日常工作离不开编码，但能够做到正视代码的，却并不多见，我不敢说自己就是正视代码的那些人，但有几个常见的对代码理解的误区，却值得跟大家探讨一下。对代码造成误解，常常体现在以下几个方面：（1）认为代码无所不能（2）认为某种形式的代码不是代码（3）认为代码越少越好。下面我们分别讨论，看看有没有似曾相识的感觉。

**开源富文本编辑器技术的演进**  
https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/268366406  
得益于开源技术，编辑器的实践经验得以延续和发展，没有绝得的好坏，每一款编辑器都有自己的特点，CKEditor是发展时间最久，它的技术线路清晰可寻，发展时间最长，跨越了编辑器技术的第一阶段和第二阶段，从CKEditor 4到CKEditor 5更是经历完全的重构，从根本上解决协同编辑的问题，Quill.js也可以称为老牌的编辑器了，受众非常大，从市面使用Quill.js的产品（石墨文档、ClickUp）也可以看出它的可塑性非常强，ProseMirror可以说是非常稳定的编辑器，知乎上也有人专门拿它和Slate做过对比，况且有Confluence做背书自然差不了，最晚出来的Slate，则一路大刀阔斧的重构，目前整体架构异常优雅和简洁，又搭载了TypeScript，感觉势头非常强劲，都是非常值得学习的。

Every 404 is someone having a bad experience and some thoughtful rules at multiple layers with the flexibility to easily add others will ensure that even 10-20 year old references to my blog will still resolve!

**How we scale Live streaming for millions of viewers simultaneously**  
https://engineering.fb.com/video-engineering/live-streaming/  
Viewers who are used to the reliability and quality of traditional TV broadcasts expect a near-flawless viewing experience for these Live streams. While many companies do one or the other well, we need to support both UGC and broadcast-quality Live streams at a very large scale. These videos have to work every time — for everyone. To accomplish this, we built a system capable of managing both UGC (captured on all kinds of devices at differing quality levels) and broadcast-quality high-res streaming — and working reliably for billions of people around the world.

https://blog.cloudflare.com/last-call-for-quic/  
QUIC and HTTP/3 are open standards that have been under development in the IETF for almost exactly 4 years. On October 21, 2020, following two rounds of Working Group Last Call, draft 32 of the family of documents that describe QUIC and HTTP/3 were put into IETF Last Call. This is an important milestone for the group. We are now telling the entire IETF community that we think we're almost done and that we'd welcome their final review.

**Speed Up Your Workflow With Figma Plugins**  
https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/10/speed-up-workflow-figma-plugins/  
There are hundreds of Figma plugins available as of today, yet the Figma plugin search functionality is pretty basic and at times it can be very difficult to find the right plugin for a certain task. Today, let’s take an in-depth look at several plugins that can speed up your design workflow.

**State-Switch Controls: The Infamous Case of the "Mute" Button**  
https://www.nngroup.com/articles/state-switch-buttons/  
Summary: On–off controls that switch between two different system states need to clearly communicate to users both the current state and the state the system will move to, should the user press that control.

**Designing User-Friendly Data Tables**  
https://www.uxbooth.com/articles/designing-user-friendly-data-tables/  
All data tables aren’t created equally and you may not need every single feature recommended in your table. Look at each column of data in the table. Is it still relevant? How is this data being used? Is it correct? How many columns are there? Can some of them be combined or removed? Are you adding new data points? Can you easily scan the data? Can you filter or manipulate the data in a way a user would need to? Have you witnessed a user interacting with this table? Maybe your users aren’t using your table at all. Maybe they would if it looked less intimidating and was easier to use.

**Numbers Shouldn't Lie – An Overview of Common Data Visualization Mistakes**  
https://www.toptal.com/designers/ux/data-visualization-mistakes  
Quantitative data is of no use without interpretation. Data visualizations synthesize the meaning of raw data into coherent takeaways. When designers prioritize compelling imagery over accuracy, visualizations deceive. To communicate data with integrity, designers must avoid common data visualization mistakes.
