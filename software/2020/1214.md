**Finite State Machines: The Developer's Bug Spray**  
https://blog.scottlogic.com/2020/12/08/finite-state-machines.html  
It’s been said that you get what you measure. So it follows that you should only measure what you really, truly want—whether or not it can be drawn as a line graph. For some, it can be frustrating to do or manage work that can’t be reduced to a number. But with work as nuanced and abstract as software development, the further we entrench ourselves in details, the more we defeat our own purposes. Useful software is our goal, and we shouldn’t settle for (or measure) anything less.

**坚守初心，白鹭引擎七年之痒**  
https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/335604641  
七年前的今天，我敲下了白鹭引擎的第一行代码，此时此刻我的孩子也终于要呱呱落地，即将成为一个父亲，我也有很多感慨。这两年经常有一些朋友来找我关心白鹭的动向，因为行业环境的原因我们市场发声变少了，产品发布节奏也慢了下来，人无名则安心练剑，年关将近，作为白鹭引擎的作者，我来和大家聊一聊2020年白鹭引擎团队专注在哪些工作上，以及我们2021年的产品重心会放在哪里。

**How To Design A Simple UI When You Have A Complex Solution**  
https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/12/design-simple-ui-complex-solution/  
Software and apps often solve very complex problems for businesses and consumers in the way of sales, marketing, finances, and so on. But offering a product that solves your users’ problems isn’t enough. If the UI is just as complex as the original problem, user churn is going to be high. Today, we’re going to look at some tips for designing a simple UI regardless of your solution’s complexity.

**Chrome Dev Summit 2020: Building an open web for our users and developers**  
https://blog.chromium.org/2020/12/chrome-dev-summit-2020-wrap-up.html  
We all benefit from an open web that is secure, powerful, and fast. Over the past year, we’ve focused our efforts on strengthening the web in three areas: Rethinking how we can deliver a safe and secure web; Adding the capabilities you need to build powerful, rich, and diverse applications; Optimizing for performance, for users and developers alike. This post is a synopsis of the updates we shared during today’s keynote at Chrome Dev Summit.

**Can developer productivity be measured?**  
https://stackoverflow.blog/2020/12/07/measuring-developer-productivity/  
Defining and measuring programmer productivity is one of the most difficult parts of an engineering manager or CTO’s job description. When everything you do is intangible, how should you measure it? Can it be measured at all?

**No One Ever Got Fired for Choosing React**  
https://jake.nyc/words/no-one-ever-got-fired-for-choosing-react/  
I’m sure there are technically better ways to build a highly interactive interface on the web, but life is too short for me to spend hours trying to figure them out. There are things I want to create, and the only way I can actually create them is to stop spending so much time on tooling. For now, I’m choosing React.

**14W 行代码量的前端页面长什么样**  
https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/334617737  
腾讯文档列表页在不久前经历了一次完全重构后，首屏速度其实已经是不错。但是我们仍然可以引入 SSR 来进一步加快速度。这篇文章就是用来记录和整理我最近实现 SSR 遇到的一些问题和思考。虽然其中有一些基础设施可能和腾讯或文档强相关，但是作为一篇涉及 Node、React 组件、性能、网络、docker 镜像 、云上部署、灰度和发布等内容的文章，仍然可以小小地作为参考或者相似需求的 Checklist。

**The semantic future of the web**  
https://stackoverflow.blog/2020/12/10/the-semantic-future-of-the-web/  
Much of the data currently exchanging hands can be viewed as human-centric. We are not the only consumers of the web though, and someday that data may be made easier to read by those non-human consumers.

**BBC Online — 2020 in review**  
https://medium.com/bbc-design-engineering/bbc-online-2020-in-review-e47dada5df3f  
With all this going on, it’s easy to forget about the fantastic work which has been going on, so we wanted to follow on from last year’s “BBC Online — 2019 in review” and document 2020. Lots of our teams have contributed so you’ll be able to see some of the highlights of their achievements. 

**The Rules of Margin Collapse** 
https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/rules-of-margin-collapse/  
In CSS, adjacent margins can sometimes overlap. This is known as “margin collapse”, and it has a reputation for being quite dastardly.

**Why I Love Tailwind**  
https://mxstbr.com/thoughts/tailwind/  
Tailwind is an atomic CSS framework that has taken the frontend world by storm. It gives developers without a deep understanding of design the ability to build visually gorgeous, modern user interfaces.

**Porting a 100% local app to the web**  
https://actualbudget.com/blog/porting-local-app-web  
A possibly unorthodox approach (a SQLite3 dependency is taken to the browser by way of WebAssembly) but it worked for this app.

**How do you test your tests?**  
https://engineering.fb.com/2020/12/10/developer-tools/probabilistic-flakiness/  
Academic research has focused primarily on trying to identify which tests are flaky and which are reliable. Software engineering practice, however, shows that all real-world tests are flaky to some extent, even if they are implemented following best engineering principles. Thus, the right question to ask is not whether a particular test is flaky, but how flaky it is. To answer this question, we’ve developed a measure of test flakiness: the probabilistic flakiness score (PFS). Using this measure, we can now test the tests to measure and monitor their reliability, and thus be able to react quickly to any regressions in the quality of our test suite.

**Introduction to Event Loop Utilization in Node.js**  
https://nodesource.com/blog/event-loop-utilization-nodejs  
In the last year, I've spent many hours writing patches for libuv and Node to collect new metrics. The goal of this was to indirectly infer the state of the application without introducing measurable overhead. I've run a few hundred hours of benchmarks and collected over one million data points to make sure my analysis was correct. Eventually, I plan to write about all aspects of my research, but today we will focus on a metric that has already been added to Node

**How to develop secure and scalable serverless APIs**  
https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/serverless/build-restful-apis-on-serverless-platforms-like-cloud-run  
Adding an API facade to serverless applications is a great way to connect data, integrate systems, and generally build more modern applications. APIs let a business securely share its data and services with developers both inside and outside the enterprise; doing so with serverless makes it easy to scale those APIs securely—without any of the usual technical complexity.

**Coral: A SQL translation, analysis, and rewrite engine for modern data lakehouses**  
https://engineering.linkedin.com/blog/2020/coral  
In this blog post, we focus on Coral, a newly open-sourced SQL translation, analysis, and rewrite engine that we integrate to the Dali Catalog, and use to virtualize views, to improve their accessibility, expressibility, and understandability by the engines, and to better control their behavior.

**Feature Casualties of Large Databases**  
https://brandur.org/large-database-casualties  
Big data has an unfortunate tendency to get messy. A few years in, a growing database that use to be small, lean, and well-designed, has better odds than not of becoming something large, bloated, and with best practices tossed aside and now considered unsalvageable.

**R at Microsoft**  
https://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2020/12/r-at-microsoft.html  
In the talk (which you can watch below) I recounted the history of Microsoft's acquisition of Revolution Analytics, and the various way the Microsoft supports R: its membership of the R Consortium, integration with many products (including demos of Azure ML Service with GitHub Actions, and Azure Functions), and how Microsoft has driven adoption of R in large organizations by making R "IT approved".
 
**How to Make Your Code Reviewer Fall in Love with You**  
https://mtlynch.io/code-review-love/  
When people talk about code reviews, they focus on the reviewer. But the developer who writes the code is just as important to the review as the person who reads it. There’s scarcely any guidance on preparing your code for review, so authors often screw up this process out of sheer ignorance. This article describes best practices for participating in a code review when you’re the author. In fact, by the end of this post, you’re going to be so good at sending out your code for review that your reviewer will literally fall in love with you.

Matrix is an open standard for interoperable, decentralised, real-time communication over IP. It’s been just over 2 months since we revealed that Gitter was going to join Matrix - and we are incredibly proud to announce that Gitter has officially turned on true native Matrix connectivity: all public Gitter rooms are now available natively via Matrix, and all Gitter users now natively exist on Matrix. 

**Kaitai Struct - A new way to develop parsers for binary structures**  
https://kaitai.io/  
Kaitai Struct is a declarative language used to describe various binary data structures, laid out in files or in memory: i.e. binary file formats, network stream packet formats, etc. The main idea is that a particular format is described in Kaitai Struct language (.ksy file) and then can be compiled with ksc into source files in one of the supported programming languages. These modules will include a generated code for a parser that can read the described data structure from a file or stream and give access to it in a nice, easy-to-comprehend API.

**User Research: Is It Worth It?**  
https://prototypr.io/post/user-research-is-it-worth-it/  
Compared to other design professions, UX has a myriad of tools that make it quick and easy to get usable data and make the right decisions. It’s a unique advantage. We don’t need to be perfect at research. But if you work on implementing it and place the user at the heart of your design process, things turn out considerably better.

**In the Spotlight: the Principles of Dark UI Design**  
https://www.toptal.com/designers/ui/dark-ui-design  
Dark UI designs are seen far and wide, from mobile screens to massive TVs. A dark theme can express power, luxury, sophistication, and elegance. However, designing for dark UIs presents multiple challenges and won’t meet expectations if implemented poorly. Before diving into the “dark side,” designers should look before they leap.

https://a16z.com/2020/12/07/social-strikes-back-video/  
Now, we’re about to enter a whole new era of video-first products that extend far beyond entertainment and gaming. If phase one of video was a laid-back experience, video 2.0 will be far more interactive and participatory, with users engaging with the platform, giving direct feedback on the content, and fundamentally shaping the experience in real time. This video-first future will enable more engaging, gratifying and geographically unconstrained social experiences than ever before. Watch a basketball game with your friend who lives on the other side of the country? Shop directly with a sales associate without having to step foot in a store? With this new era of video, all formerly in-person engagements are candidates for reinvention. How did we get to this moment?

如果说这个世界上的管理，有儒家和法家之分。儒家用道德（文化）管理公司，法家用规则（KPI）管理公司。那么这三家公司，就是典型的儒家式管理公司。他们没有法家的KPI，因此没有奖金，更没有常规意义上的考核。他们依靠文化，依靠选拔最优秀的人，依靠给足员工自由和安全感，来激发员工最大的创造力。他们不管理员工，他们只是提供平台，让员工自我驱动。
