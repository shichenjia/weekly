**More challenging projects every programmer should try**  
https://web.eecs.utk.edu/~azh/blog/morechallengingprojects.html  
One year ago, I posted Challenging projects every programmer should try. It included a text editor, Space Invaders, a BASIC compiler, a small operating system, a spreadsheet, and a video game console emulator. It blew up across the internet, amassing over 100,000 views in a month (read more about it going viral). I'm now expanding the list with more "modern" projects: Ray tracer, Key-value store web API, Web browser, Stock trading bot.

**Introducing Zero-Bundle-Size React Server Components**  
https://reactjs.org/blog/2020/12/21/data-fetching-with-react-server-components.html  
https://addyosmani.com/blog/react-server-components/  
2020 has been a long year. As it comes to an end we wanted to share a special Holiday Update on our research into zero-bundle-size React Server Components.

**How The Web is Really Built**  
https://css-tricks.com/how-the-web-is-really-built/  
We spend so much time in the bubble of bleeding-edge tech that we lose touch with how the web is really built. Most of the web favors old, stable tech instead of new bling. Nobody uses jQuery anymore, right? Wrong. It appears on 83% of all websites! Everyone uses Jamstack instead of bloated CMSes, right, right? Wrong. Static site generators are used in less than 1% of websites, WordPress powers one-third of the Web.

**HTML Over The Wire**  
https://hotwire.dev/  
Hotwire is an alternative approach to building modern web applications without using much JavaScript by sending HTML instead of JSON over the wire. This makes for fast first-load pages, keeps template rendering on the server, and allows for a simpler, more productive development experience in any programming language, without sacrificing any of the speed or responsiveness associated with a traditional single-page application.

**How we built the GitHub globe**  
https://github.blog/2020-12-21-how-we-built-the-github-globe/  
world build and work together on GitHub. With our new homepage, we wanted to show how open source development transcends the borders we’re living in and to tell our product story through the lens of a developer’s journey. Now that it’s live, we would love to share how we built the homepage-directly from the voices of our designers and developers.

**Write code. Not too much. Mostly functions**  
https://www.brandonsmith.ninja/blog/write-code-not-too-much-mostly-functions  
By "functions" here I mean "pure functions". You could make a case that pure functions aren't the "plants" of code, though I feel that they are. In my experience most codebases have a pure functional subset, and I believe writing that subset in a pure-functional style is nearly always a win for the long-term health of the project.

https://engineering.fb.com/2020/12/21/video-engineering/rsys/  
In looking at how we could make video calling more efficient and easier to scale for the future, we realized that our best way forward was to redesign the library from the ground up and rewrite the entire library. The result is rsys, a video calling library that allows us to make use of significant advancements made in the video calling space since the original library was written in 2014.

**How to design a new programming language from scratch**  
https://drewdevault.com/2020/12/25/How-to-design-a-new-programming-language.html  
There is a long, difficult road from vague, pie-in-the-sky ideas about what would be cool to have in a new programming language, to a robust, self-consistent, practical implementation of those ideas. Designing and implementing a new programming language from scratch is one of the most challenging tasks a programmer can undertake.

**The Year in Math and Computer Science**  
https://www.quantamagazine.org/quantas-year-in-math-and-computer-science-2020-20201223/

https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2021/1/249440-2021-computings-divided-future/fulltext  
Temper distrust, secrecy, and competition by keeping the humanity of your colleagues in mind. As tensions rise, many individuals will face difficult choices torn by comflicting loyalties. As individuals we all want to survive and thrive—personally and professionally. But each of us do so within imperfect systems—perhaps not to our liking and certainly beyond our control. Let's work to preserve computing's community!

**How and why I stopped buying new laptops**  
https://www.lowtechmagazine.com/2020/12/how-and-why-i-stopped-buying-new-laptops.html  
Being an independent journalist – or an office worker if you wish – I always reasoned that I needed a decent computer and that I need to pay for that quality. Between 2000 and 2017, I consumed three laptops that I bought new and which cost me around 5,000 euros in total – roughly 300 euros per year over the entire period. The average useful life of my three laptops was 5.7 years.

**Fantasy UIs**  
https://www.pushing-pixels.org/fui/  
https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25525290  
As a UI/UX agency that focusses on B2B SaaS, I’ve always found Fantasy UIs fascinating. It’s the complete opposite of the simple & clean interfaces clients ask us to design. I’ve spent some time thinking about why these Fantasy UIs are so fascinating despite the fact they seem not very user friendly. My conclusion was that fantasy Interfaces are very much like the early web. Lots of moving parts (dancing banana gifs) and you had to figure out the navigation on each website you visited. Today, everything looks and feels the same and we lost the creative spirit of interface building.

Nobody knows what the future will bring. However, let’s try to figure out what design styles that already appeared may become a significant trend in 2021. Releated: [What will UX be like in 2021?](https://www.uxbooth.com/articles/what-will-ux-be-like-in-2021/).

**Micro-interactions in UX: The art of subtlety**  
https://uxmag.com/articles/micro-interactions-in-ux-the-art-of-subtlety  
Micro-interactions provide feedback to the user by letting them know the status of an interaction, like a loading bar. Helping users see direct, real-time results of their interactions enhance the sense of direct manipulation to which users respond favorably — when they press a button, they immediately know action has been triggered, giving a sense of control.

**Inspirations from a LEGO Instructional Booklet**  
https://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2020/12/inspirations-from-a-lego-instructional-booklet.php  
This fall, as I sought opportunities to facilitate constructive play with my two sons and reduce their screen time and mine, I discovered inspiration in a box of LEGO® toys—specifically, the building instructions that came with it. As I read through the booklet, I found myself comparing its simple, effective workflow to the experiences that UX designers endeavor to create. So, in this column, I’ll share some inspirational lessons that I learned and provide some ideas for how you can apply them in your own work.

**The internet has been a lifeline in 2020 – but not for everyone. Governments must act.**  
https://webfoundation.org/2020/12/the-internet-has-been-a-lifeline-in-2020-but-not-for-everyone-governments-must-act/  
2020 has been the year of digital salvation and of digital deprivation. Just as the world has turned to the internet to work from home, keep businesses alive, go to school online and stay connected with loved ones, around 3.5 billion people — almost half the world — remain without internet access.

**2020, finally over: Stories from Google this year**  
https://blog.google/inside-google/life-at-google/2020-at-google/  
The year 2020 felt particularly sluggish—and simultaneously much, much too fast. With so many things happening in the world (and far fewer things happening in my day-to-day quarantine life), it’d be easy to forget what exactly occurred and when. So humor us while we—gasp!—revisit the past year a bit, and take a look at some of what we worked on here at Google. Because as slow as the year may have felt at times, what didn’t happen in 2020?
