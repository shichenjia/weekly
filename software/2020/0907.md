**What is the Value of Browser Diversity?**  
https://daverupert.com/2020/09/the-value-of-browser-diversity/  
I’ve thought about these questions for over a year and narrowed my feelings of browser diversity down to two major value propositions: Browser diversity keeps the Web deliberately slow; Browser diversity fosters consensus and cooperation over corporate rule.They are similar, but slightly different concepts for me.

**Solid - The best JavaScript UI library?**  
https://areknawo.com/solid-the-best-javascript-ui-library/  
To wrap this up, [Solid](https://github.com/ryansolid/solid) is a really promising UI library with tons of advantages. The familiarity of JSX and React concepts and the speed and bundle size of Svelte make it seem like an ideal UI library. The few drawback that Solid has either aren't that bad, or can be easily fixed, as the library continues to evolve.

**TypeScript is weakening the JavaScript ecosystem**  
https://timdaub.github.io/2020/09/01/typescript/  
Therefore, TypeScript authors should, in my opinion, do something along the following lines: namespacing their TypeScript packages; or build and publish their packages to their package manager. However, continuing to publish TypeScript packages to npm is, in my opinion weakening the JavaScript ecosystem as it's splitting its community and polluting the npm namespace.

**Everything Developers Need To Know About Figma**  
https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/09/figma-developers-guide/  
Figma is a design tool that is rapidly gaining popularity and becoming more common in companies around the world. Unlike most design software, Figma is free and browser-based so developers can easily access the full design files making the developer handoff process significantly smoother. This article teaches developers who have nothing but a basic understanding of design tools everything they need to know to work with Figma.

**React is becoming a black box**  
https://jaredpalmer.com/blog/react-is-becoming-a-black-box  
Thus, my only suggestion would be to perhaps take extra care when the React team releases Concurrent Mode (and/or whatever comes next) to re-teach people about how to reason about React. I think a good ol’ Pete Hunt-style “Thinking in X mode” blog post would go a long way. Anyways, that’s it for my hot take. What do you think?

**Rendering React on the Edge with Flareact and Cloudflare Workers**  
https://blog.cloudflare.com/rendering-react-on-the-edge-with-flareact-and-cloudflare-workers/  
I’m excited to announce Flareact, a new open-source React framework built for Cloudflare Workers. With Flareact, you don’t need to make the tradeoff between a static site and a dynamic application. Flareact allows you to render your React apps at the edge rather than on the server. It is modeled after Next.js, which means it supports file-based page routing, dynamic page paths and edge-side data fetching APIs.

**我来聊聊前端应用表现层抽象**  
https://ourai.ws/posts/abstraction-of-frontend-application-presentation-layer/  
在一个复杂的前端应用中，如果不对其进行分层，那它的扩展性和可维护性等真的会不忍直视……通常是采用经典的三层架构，从下到上分别为数据层、逻辑层和表现层。本文以表现层为例，将其再次划分出抽象层、运行层和适配层这三层，实际上数据层和逻辑层也可以套用这种模式——就像在生日蛋糕上切上四刀——我称其为「九宫格」模型。在表现层的各种抽象中，本文着重阐述了视图结构描述的技术选型与设计思路，可以看出 XML-like 的模板从编写到解析再到渲染这一整条流程，与 Angular 和 Vue 的模板及 HTML 大体上一致；其他抽象只是稍微提了提，以后有机会再展开来说。

**羚珑视频编辑器开发总结**  
https://aotu.io/notes/2020/09/01/video-editor-summary/  
视频编辑器的主要作用是用户可以通过操作静态的PSD从而得到我们想要的动态设计效果。对比AE等复杂的视频编辑软件，学习成本大大降低，且动效的可复用性、移植性等也减轻了用户的工作量。

**如何有效的进行公司名称匹配**  
https://cdc.tencent.com/2020/08/30/%e5%a6%82%e4%bd%95%e6%9c%89%e6%95%88%e7%9a%84%e8%bf%9b%e8%a1%8c%e5%85%ac%e5%8f%b8%e5%90%8d%e7%a7%b0%e5%8c%b9%e9%85%8d/  
本文需要解决的是公司简称和全称之间的匹配问题，传统的字符串模糊匹配在匹配字符数量相差很大的情况下通常得分很低（简称长度通常在2～6个字符，全称则通常是10个字符以上）。针对此问题本文总结了一些方式和方法来提高匹配率。

**Revisiting Adaptive Design, a lost design movement**  
http://interconnected.org/home/2020/08/26/adaptive_design  
I was reminded today of Dan Hill’s work in the early 2000s on Adaptive Design – and it feels to me like this movement, focused on re-use, modularity, and unintended customisation, is one worth revisiting, almost 20 years on. I’ll cover some history and then talk about why this matters. Read more：[Comparing Browsers for Responsive Design](https://css-tricks.com/comparing-browsers-for-responsive-design/).

**How we threat model**  
https://github.blog/2020-09-02-how-we-threat-model/  
At GitHub, we spend a lot of time thinking about and building secure products—and one key facet of that is threat modeling. This practice involves bringing security and engineering teams together to discuss systems, ultimately generating action items that improve the security of the system. Threat modeling has helped us better communicate between security and engineering teams, has shifted the security review process to be more proactive, and has led to more reliable and more secure system designs.

**Key Challenges with Quasi Experiments at Netflix**  
https://netflixtechblog.com/key-challenges-with-quasi-experiments-at-netflix-89b4f234b852  
At Netflix, when we can’t run A/B experiments we run quasi experiments! We run quasi experiments with various objectives such as non-member experiments focusing on acquisition, member experiments focusing on member engagement, or video streaming experiments focusing on content delivery. Consolidating on one methodology could be a challenge, as we may face different design or data constraints or optimization goals. We discuss some key challenges and approaches Netflix has been using to handle small sample size and limited pre-intervention data in quasi experiments.

We’re living in the API economy. Here’s how it can work for you.

**If everyone hates it, why is OOP still so widely spread?**  
https://stackoverflow.blog/2020/09/02/if-everyone-hates-it-why-is-oop-still-so-widely-spread/  
OOP has been wildly successful. But was the success just a coincidence? And can it still offer something unique in 2020 that other programming paradigms cannot?

**We Didn't Encrypt Your Password, We Hashed It. Here's What That Means**  
https://www.troyhunt.com/we-didnt-encrypt-your-password-we-hashed-it-heres-what-that-means/  
You've possibly just found out you're in a data breach. The organisation involved may have contacted you and advised your password was exposed but fortunately, they encrypted it. But you should change it anyway. Huh? Isn't the whole point of encryption that it protects data when exposed to unintended parties? 

**The database I wish I had**  
https://euandre.org/2020/08/31/the-database-i-wish-i-had.html  
I watched the talk “Platform as a Reflection of Values: Joyent, Node.js and beyond” by Bryan Cantrill, and I think he was able to put into words something I already felt for some time: if there’s no piece of software out there that reflects your values, it’s time for you to build that software1. I kind of agree with what he said, because this is already happening to me. I long for a database with a certain set of values, and for a few years I was just waiting for someone to finally write it. After watching his talk, Bryan is saying to me: “time to stop waiting, and start writing it yourself”. So let me try to give an overview of such database, and go over its values.

**Full-Text Search Battle: PostgreSQL vs Elasticsearch**  
https://rocky.dev/full-text-search  
I started investigating full-text search options recently. The use-case is real-time search over key-value pairs where the keys are strings and the values are either strings, numbers, or dates. It should enable full-text search over keys and values and range queries over numbers and dates with 1.5 million unique key-value pairs as the expected maximum search index size. The search company Algolia recommends an end-to-end latency budget of no more than 50ms, so we’ll use that as our threshold.

**How Facebook Accelerates SQL at Extreme Scale**  
https://www.datanami.com/2020/08/31/how-facebook-accelerates-sql-at-extreme-scale/  
Serving SQL queries on a petabyte of data is one thing, but delivering it at Facebook’s scale is something else entirely. Earlier this year, the social media giant implemented the Alluxio distributed file system into its massive data architecture to speed up queries, while maintaining the separation of compute and storage.

**The Life of a Data Byte**  
https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=3419941  
A byte is just eight bits.. right? Not always! Jessie takes a pretty interesting ‘walk down memory lane’ (ha!) to look at the history of bits and bytes from 1951 to the current time. You’ll learn at least an interesting factoid or two here.

A key piece of this roadmap was partnering with our friends at GitHub to provide a native experience using the same service that powers Visual Studio Codespaces. Today, we’d like to share some news regarding this partnership: Visual Studio Codespaces will be consolidating into GitHub Codespaces.

**Design for Coherence, not Consistency**  
https://uxmag.com/articles/design-for-coherence-not-consistency  
If we ask any design system advocate what are the main reasons to build and maintain a design system, chances are ‘Consistency’ will come up as first or second in their list, together with the ‘A single source of truth’ point, which is pretty much saying the same, with different words. This reasoning is valid but incomplete, and it could lead to a wrong product strategy and overall poor results.

**How a Human Centered Design Process Infinitely Enhances Your UX and UI**  
https://www.uxpin.com/studio/blog/human-centered-design/  
The concept of human-centered design isn’t new. The overlap between human-centered design and User experience/UI design is large, though there are some subtle differences. In this blog post, we’ll explore the basics of human-centered design and how it overlaps with UI/UX, provide examples, and outline the process to create a human-centered design. Here at UXPin, we think all great designs are human-centered.
