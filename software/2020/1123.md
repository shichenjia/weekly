**Moving my serverless project to Ruby on Rails**  
https://frantic.im/back-to-rails  
Early benefits of serverless (for hobby projects): Easy to get started, Don’t have to configure or maintain servers, Free for small loads. In reality, writing the simple Lambda functions turned out to be only 10% of the work. Time passed and my backend started getting more complex: I needed to store some state for each puzzle, send confirmation emails, show an order details page. I think it’s just a typical software development lifecycle: things grow organically, become a mess, and require some refactoring. Make it run first (discover market fit), then make it right (refactor to integrate the new discoveries). Serverless is like a black hole. It promised exciting adventures, but gravity sucked me in and I spent most of my efforts dealing with its complexity, instead of focusing on my product.

**Beyond the Database, and Beyond the Stream Processor: What's the Next Step for Data Management?**  
https://www.infoq.com/articles/whats-the-next-step-for-data-management/  
As companies become more automated, and their business processes become more automated, we end up with many applications talking to one another. This is a humongous shift in system design as it’s about doing the work in a fully automated fashion by machines. We need to rethink what a database is, what it means to us, and how we interact with both the data it contains and the event streams that connect it all together.

**Good Architecture: Data Model vs. Data Flow**  
https://somehowmanage.com/2020/11/20/good-architecture-data-model-vs-data-flow/  
Most architectural mistakes I’ve seen in software stem from a mistake either in the domain model or the data flow. Understanding what each of those two things is, how to do them both well, and how to balance the tensions between them is an essential skill every developer should invest in.

**Flash Animations Live Forever at the Internet Archive**  
http://blog.archive.org/2020/11/19/flash-animations-live-forever-at-the-internet-archive/  
http://blog.archive.org/2020/11/22/flash-back-further-thoughts-on-flash-at-the-internet-archive/  
Great news for everyone concerned about the Flash end of life planned for end of 2020: The Internet Archive is now emulating Flash animations, games and toys in our software collection. Utilizing an in-development Flash emulator called [Ruffle](https://ruffle.rs/), we have added Flash support to the Internet Archive’s Emularity system, letting a subset of Flash items play in the browser as if you had a Flash plugin installed. While Ruffle’s compatibility with Flash is less than 100%, it will play a very large portion of historical Flash animation in the browser, at both a smooth and accurate rate.

**Graphics for JVM**  
https://tonsky.me/blog/skija/  
Let’s say I want to build high-quality desktop apps. I also want to do it on JVM. Don’t get your hopes up—we are not there yet. But I have a plan. [JetBrains Skija: Skia bindings for Java](https://github.com/JetBrains/skija - Skia bindings for Java) is a part of the bigger picture. Java UI progress was blocked by the poor-performing Graphics2D. It’s not anymore. What will grow out of it?

**解决 Web 应用与浏览器快捷键冲突的一条野路子**  
https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/300659062  
Web 应用 相比于 Native 应用 存在一个显著的缺点：键盘事件会冲突，现象是部分快捷键组合在 Web 应用中会 “失效”，举几个例子：如 Cmd + W、 Cmd + N 、 Cmd + T 等等组合，这些事件不做额外处理是无法被 Web 应用所正常响应的。究其原因，可以归于 “Web App 还未来得及处理 Keyborads Event，Browser 已经做出了对应的响应并产生了副作用”，比如当 Cmd + W 被浏览器响应后，其副作用为关闭当前 tab 页，页面都被关闭了，Web App 自然也就被关了。

**Svelte vs React**  
https://dbushell.com/2020/11/16/svelte-vs-react/  
My early impressions of Svelte were positive but my test drive didn’t venture far. Since then I’ve built a more substantial client website using Svelte in part. Using it in production has given me a greater understanding. I’m comparing Svelte to React because the latter has been my tool of choice for years. A few key differences have come to mind.

https://github.blog/2020-11-20-nbdev-a-literate-programming-environment-that-democratizes-software-engineering-best-practices/  
While a subset of ideas from literate programming have shown up in tools, such as Swift Playgrounds, Jupyter, and Mathematica, there has been a lack of tools that encompass the entire software development life cycle. nbdev builds on top of Jupyter notebooks to fill these gaps and provides the following features, many of which are integrated with GitHub.

**The Life of a Data Byte**  
https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2020/12/248797-the-life-of-a-data-byte/fulltext  
A byte of data has been stored in a number of different ways through the years as newer, better, and faster storage media are introduced. A byte is a unit of digital information that most commonly refers to eight bits. A bit is a unit of information that can be expressed as 0 or 1, representing a logical state. Let's take a brief walk down memory lane to learn about the origins of bits and bytes.

So, after doing some research, I decided to go back to Linux on a Lenovo and tweak it to make it as similar as possible to what I was used to on macOS. Here’s my guide for how to improve the Linux desktop experience.

**Everyone Should Have Access to the Web**  
https://thehistoryoftheweb.com/world-wide-web-foundation-and-africa/  
The goal is simple: a safe and reliable web, something that will be essential as we move more of our lives, from everyday business to our education system, online. The targets, however, are slipping. When it comes to moving schoolwork online, for instance, we continue to fail, even in the U.S.. One in five parents report that lack of access to the Internet will prevent their children from completing schoolwork. These problems have not disappeared because of Covid-19. They have gotten worse.

**The future of work, unbound: 2020 and the strange new mobility of space and time**  
https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/the-future-of-work-unbound-2020-and-the-strange-new-mobility-of-space-and-time/  
We have discussed how the Fleet system explores new ways to think about mobility, and we’ve shown how it builds on an exciting new distributed-systems technology known as Ambrosia. These technologies work to build and implement applications that not only go beyond the current device, but also unbind other dimensions of mobility—the current user, the current application, the current time—as well. Beyond that, as hinted at by our final example above, our research shows how sensors can bridge transitions from the current (sensed) context to another—by responding appropriately to natural human activity.
