**2020: The Year of Robot Rights**  
https://thereader.mitpress.mit.edu/2020-the-year-of-robot-rights/  
A once-unthinkable concept is gaining traction and deserves our attention. 另附：[Artificial Intelligence Will Do What We Ask.

**Low-code / No-code development: Guide to faster development**  
https://blog.aimultiple.com/low-code/  
Businesses are starting to take advantage of low-code platforms to develop and deploy apps by reducing the pressure on their IT teams by minimizing hand-coding and code to be maintained. With a low-code development platform, businesses can automate time-consuming manual coding processes and speed up their app delivery. However, not all business problems are suitable for low code: simple, business driven projects are a good starting point. 另附：[Ionic - The No-Code Tragedy](https://ionicframework.com/blog/the-no-code-tragedy/).

**Some Useful Probability Facts for Systems Programming**  
https://theartofmachinery.com/2020/01/27/systems_programming_probability.html  
Probability problems come up a lot in systems programming, and I’m using that term loosely to mean everything from operating systems programming and networking, to building large online services, to creating virtual worlds like in games. Here’s a bunch of rough-and-ready probability rules of thumb that are deeply related and have many practical applications when designing systems.

**TypeScript’s quirks: How inconsistencies make the language more complex**  
https://blog.asana.com/2020/01/typescript-quirks/  
If you care about a perfect, consistent type system, TypeScript probably isn’t for you (Reason seems like it could be good). But if you want to add some type safety to an existing JavaScript codebase while leveraging a large, thriving open source community, then TypeScript is still your best bet. If you decide to use TypeScript, expect engineers on your team to have a good amount of head-scratching and wasted time reasoning about the compiler, but not nearly so much as to offset the amazing value that static types provide. 另附：[Why the TypeScript team is using Gatsby for its new website](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/2020-01-23-why-typescript-chose-gatsby/).

**React Native is the Future of Mobile at Shopify**  
https://engineering.shopify.com/blogs/engineering/react-native-future-mobile-shopify  
After years of native mobile development, we’ve decided to go full steam ahead building all of our new mobile apps using React Native. As I’ll explain, that decision doesn’t come lightly. Each quarter, the majority of buyers purchase on mobile (with 71% of our buyers purchasing on mobile in Q3 of last year). Black Friday and Cyber Monday (together, BFCM) are the busiest time of year for our merchants, and buying activity during those days is a bellwether. During this year’s BFCM, Shopify merchants saw another 3% increase in purchases on mobile, an average of 69% of sales. So why the switch to React Native? And why now? How does this fit in with our native mobile development? It’s a complicated answer that’s best served with a little background.  

**Humans can't read URLs. How can we fix it? - HTTP 203**  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-wB1VY3Nrc  
In this episode, Jake makes the case that URLs are impossible for humans to interpret, especially when it comes to security. What are browsers doing today to overcome that? And, is there a better way?

**An Accessible Digital BBC – 2019 in review**  
https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/internet/entries/aac6bdff-3580-4265-9976-8214d24246ce  
The BBC Accessibility Champion Network is probably one of the oldest in the industry. This year it surpassed 200 champions. There is also an alumnus of 75+ now encouraging inclusive design and accessibility elsewhere in the industry. Here are the top highlights of many accessibility improvements in BBC digital products this year.

**How I write backends**  
https://github.com/fpereiro/backendlore  
From late 2012 to the present I have been writing backends (server-side code) for web applications. This document summarizes many aspects of how I write these pieces of code.

**SQLite Is Serverless**  
https://www.sqlite.org/serverless.html  
There are advantages and disadvantages to being serverless. The main advantage is that there is no separate server process to install, setup, configure, initialize, manage, and troubleshoot. This is one reason why SQLite is a "zero-configuration" database engine. Programs that use SQLite require no administrative support for setting up the database engine before they are run. Any program that is able to access the disk is able to use an SQLite database. Most SQL database engines are client/server based. Of those that are serverless, SQLite is the only one known to this author that allows multiple applications to access the same database at the same time. 另附：[Serverless Cloud Computing Will Drive Explosive Growth In AI-Based Innovation](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2020/01/27/serverless-cloud-computing-will-drive-explosive-growth-in-ai-based-innovation/#6ee05c615f56).

**Distributed SQL vs. NewSQL**  
https://blog.yugabyte.com/distributedsql-vs-newsql/  
NewSQL databases were first created in early 2010s to solve the write scalability challenge associated with monolithic SQL databases. They allowed multiple nodes to be used in the context of a SQL database without making any significant enhancements to the replication architecture. The cloud was still at its infancy at that time so this strategy worked for a few years. However as multi-zone, multi-region and multi-cloud cloud deployments became the standard for modern applications, these databases fell behind in developer adoption. On the other hand, distributed SQL databases like Google Spanner and YugabyteDB are built ground-up to exploit the full elasticity of the cloud and are also designed to work on inherently unreliable infrastructure.

**Google Sheets for Developers**

Say goodbye to the days of TPS reports, and come learn how to automate the tedious tasks in your work day. Thanks to the extensibility of Google Sheets (and a special JavaScript client library for Sheets), as well as Cloud Functions, that’s easy. You can have all kinds of data, for example GitHub, Jira, uptime health, and even sales data combined and imported into a Sheet, analyzed, and output as an email report or slide deck-without ever opening [...]

**MediaPipe on the Web**  
https://developers.googleblog.com/2020/01/mediapipe-on-web.html  
MediaPipe is a framework for building cross-platform multimodal applied ML pipelines. We have previously demonstrated building and running ML pipelines as MediaPipe graphs on mobile (Android, iOS) and on edge devices like Google Coral. In this article, we are excited to present MediaPipe graphs running live in the web browser, enabled by WebAssembly and accelerated by XNNPack ML Inference Library. By integrating this preview functionality into our web-based Visualizer tool, we provide a playground for quickly iterating over a graph design. Since everything runs directly in the browser, video never leaves the user’s computer and each iteration can be immediately tested on a live webcam stream (and soon, arbitrary video). 另附：[Encode, Tag and Realize: A Controllable and Efficient Approach for Text Generation](https://ai.googleblog.com/2020/01/encode-tag-and-realize-controllable-and.html).  

**On the road to Swift 6**  
https://forums.swift.org/t/on-the-road-to-swift-6/32862  
With those fundamentals in place, as a community, we are well-poised to pursue new frontiers for the Swift project. I’d like to highlight a few areas that the Core Team believes provide really exciting opportunities for the community to drive Swift forward.

**Monoliths are the future**  
https://changelog.com/posts/monoliths-are-the-future  
Monoliths are the future because the problem people are trying to solve with microservices doesn’t really line up with reality. Just to be honest - and I’ve done this before, gone from microservices to monoliths and back again. Both directions.

**Puppeteer 2.1**  
https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/releases/tag/v2.1.0  
The launcher now has an option to run Puppeteer with different browsers, starting with Firefox (#5137). Puppeteer can now talk to a real, unpatched Firefox binary (as opposed to the old Juggler-based approach). This is a first step towards eventually deprecating the separate puppeteer-firefox package in favor of supporting Firefox directly in puppeteer itself.

**Pandas 1.0.0 What’s new in 1.0.0 (January 29, 2020)**  
https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/whatsnew/v1.0.0.html  
The pandas 1.0 release removed a lot of functionality that was deprecated in previous releases (see below for an overview). It is recommended to first upgrade to pandas 0.25 and to ensure your code is working without warnings, before upgrading to pandas 1.0.

**Microsoft Application Inspector**  
https://github.com/Microsoft/ApplicationInspector  
Microsoft Application Inspector is a software source code analysis tool that helps identify and surface well-known features and other interesting characteristics of source code to aid in determining what the software is or what it does. Application Inspector is different from traditional static analysis tools in that it doesn't attempt to identify "good" or "bad" patterns; it simply reports what it finds against a set of over 400 rule patterns for feature detection including features that impact security such as the use of cryptography and more. This can be extremely helpful in reducing the time needed to determine what Open Source or other components do by examining the source directly rather than trusting to limited documentation or recommendations.

https://github.com/react-spring/react-use-gesture  
React-use-gesture is a hook that lets you bind richer mouse and touch events to any component or view. With the data you receive, it becomes trivial to set up gestures, and often takes no more than a few lines of code. You can use it stand-alone, but to make the most of it you should combine it with an animation library like react-spring, though you can most certainly use any other.

Before I became Chief People Officer at New Relic in early 2017, I worked in management consulting for more than 15 years. That meant I got to work in a wide variety of corporate cultures—the good, the bad, and the truly unphotogenic. I’ve come to understand that while approaches differ, the best ones always focus on this core goal: How do you create an environment where employees are excited to show up every morning and do their best work? 另附：[5 tips for creating a secure DevOps culture](https://www.fastly.com/blog/5-tips-for-secure-devops-culture).
