**Complexity Has to Live Somewhere**  
https://ferd.ca/complexity-has-to-live-somewhere.html  
Fighting complexity is a recurring theme of software development I've seen repeat itself over and over again. It's something I keep seeing debated at all levels: just how much commenting should go on in functions and methods? What's the ideal amount of abstraction? When does a framework start having "too much magic"? When are there too many languages in an organisation? We try to get rid of the complexity, control it, and seek simplicity. I think framing things that way is misguided. Complexity has to live somewhere.

**From Amazon to Stripe: How APIs are Powering the Digital Economy**  
https://tyk.io/from-amazon-to-stripe-how-apis-are-powering-the-digital-economy/

**离开竞争的第一个发力点是专注产品**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/p5pZa5KoBgh3H_R6HGmdBA  
企业能够生存的第一个理由就是能够提供产品，所以能够带领企业离开竞争的第一个发力点就是专注于产品。产品对于企业而言，既是企业进入市场的前提条件，也是企业存活于市场的根本原因。如果没有产品，企业就没有了与顾客交流的平台，也就没有了在市场中存在的理由。顾客在认知企业品牌的时候，感受到的正是企业的产品。如果不在产品上做出努力，反而在其他地方花心思，一定会让企业丧失自己的生命力。所以能够带领企业离开竞争的第一个发力点是专注于产品。

**Keystone Interface**  
https://martinfowler.com/bliki/KeystoneInterface.html  
Software development teams find life can be much easier if they integrate their work as often as they can. They also find it valuable to release frequently into production. But teams don't want to expose half-developed features to their users. A useful technique to deal with this tension is to build all the back-end code, integrate, but don't build the user-interface. The feature can be integrated and tested, but the UI is held back until the end until, like a keystone, it's added to complete the feature, revealing it to the users.

**Continuously refactoring 100000 lines of code**  
https://www.tiny.cloud/blog/modern-javascript-refactoring-tinymce/  
Over the last 24 months or so, TinyMCE has had more underlying restructuring than ever before. We’ve done this in order to take TinyMCE into the modern age of JavaScript, with modern UI/UX thinking and a rich plugin and API infrastructure, ensuring it remains the most popular open source rich text editor and the number one choice for professional software developers.

**Application Performance Management in 2020: in-Depth guide**  
https://blog.aimultiple.com/apm/  
Businesses need to monitor their system performance and resolve technical issues rapidly. For example, slowdowns or errors within the ERP system can stop the whole company from functioning: orders can not be served, suppliers can not be paid etc. Companies can use APM tools to prevent these issues. APM refers to application performance management or application performance monitoring. Since APM tools facilitate monitoring the availability and performance of systems, they can help detect problems and run root-cause analysis to enable quick resolution of these problems.

**Fuzzing Firefox with WebIDL**  
https://hacks.mozilla.org/2020/04/fuzzing-with-webidl/  
For the past 3 years, the Firefox fuzzing team has been developing a new fuzzer to help identify security vulnerabilities in the implementation of WebAPIs in Firefox.  This fuzzer, which we’re calling Domino, leverages the WebAPIs’ own WebIDL definitions as a fuzzing grammar.  Our approach has led to the identification of over 850 bugs. 116 of those bugs have received a security rating.  In this post, I’d like to discuss some of Domino’s key features and how they differ from our previous WebAPI fuzzing efforts.

**技术团队 TL 如何培养人才？钉钉前端团队负责人为你总结了这些经验**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=Mzg4MjE5OTI4Mw==&mid=2247484573&idx=1&sn=86bc92056c16d771f6e38f39ab4a3e5d  
钉钉是面向多终端的，效率、稳定、体验是前端必须要去思考三大话题。关于提效，在钉钉上一直在探索如何实现一套代码多端运行。关于体验提升，如何通过技术持续探索来提升用户体验，包括 Hybrid，小程序，Flutter 等技术。还有稳定性，要服务 10 亿用户，如何提供企业级的稳定性是我们一直在实践和总结的。作为 TL，深度了解你的团队非常重要，要去了解每个人的想法是什么，他的诉求是什么，他目前的状态怎么样，以及对他成长情况的感知。

**前端有架构吗？**  
https://ourai.ws/posts/architecture-of-frontend-application/  
从事前端开发的你，不知有没有被问过：「前端有架构吗？」问你的人的身份，可能是你的 boss 或上司，可能是后端同事，也可能是前端同行；问你的人的目的，可能是刁难，可能是嘲讽，也可能是请教。

**A Visual Guide To React Mental Models**  
https://obedparla.com/code/a-visual-guide-to-react-mental-models/  
I work with React every day and I’m constantly finding solutions to challenging problems. I can do that by having good mental models around React. In this article I will explain those mental models that help me solve problems and tame complexity. Whether you’ve been working with React for years or are just starting, having a useful mental model is, in my opinion, the fastest way to feel confident working with it.

**A Critique of React Hooks**  
https://dillonshook.com/a-critique-of-react-hooks/  
I'm not asking you to never use hooks or remove them from your project. As I said in the intro, I would still use hooks in a new project, and I think they do improve the prior situation of HOC's creating component hierarchies deeper than the Mariana Trench. But I also think they're not the "Computing Promised Land". It might be a while before we get there though. So until then, just use them judiciously. P.S. Library authors, please try to keep things simple!

**What I wish I knew about React**  
https://bitsofco.de/what-i-wish-i-knew-about-react/  
Coming from the Angular (and Ionic) world, it felt like all my preconceived notions and ideas were being turned upside down. I managed to put together (what I think is) a pretty decent application, but I had a lot of roadblocks along the way. This is partly because I prefer to learn by just diving in (the only tutorial I did was this React Native Crash Course). So, a lot of these roadblocks could have been solved by me just reading the documentation. That said, in case there’s anyone else there like me, here are a few things I wish I knew before I got started.

**Demystifying React Redux**  
https://blog.scottlogic.com/2020/05/01/demystifying-react-redux.html  
In this post, I’ll be implementing “crappy React Redux”. This is intended to give a general idea of what’s going on when you connect your React app to Redux, rather than give a detailed description of how React Redux is implemented in practice.

**is-promise post mortem**  
https://medium.com/javascript-in-plain-english/is-promise-post-mortem-cab807f18dcc  
I had been intending to set up more of my projects to be automatically published via CI, instead of manually published from my local machine, but because is-promise is such a tiny library, I figured it probably wasn’t worth the effort. This was definitely a mistake. However, even if I had setup publishing via CI is-promise may not have had sufficiently thorough tests.

**Gardened**  
https://ethanmarcotte.com/wrote/gardened/  
In other words, they have to give a damn. But giving a damn doesn’t scale. Time and again, our industry chooses frameworks that weren’t designed for accessibility or for performance. And in the middle of a global health crisis, I think it’s time we talked about how the tech industry—an industry responsible for providing life-saving information and services, now more than ever—can be allowed to self-regulate. 

**Evolving Alongside your Tech Stack**  
https://blog.heroku.com/evolving-alongside-tech-stack  
In this post, we'll explore how you can stay on top of the changing software development landscape, without sacrificing your desires to learn or the success of your product. You should own tools which you know how to operate, rather than keep a shed full of all sorts of shiny objects.

**What are data insights?**  
https://algorithmia.com/blog/what-are-data-insights  
In the digital world we live in, there are copious amounts of data at our fingertips. But though anyone can access raw data, the ability to extract valuable and actionable information from the numbers is what will determine whether you can generate a competitive advantage for your business. 另附：[What is Data Science at Lyft?](https://eng.lyft.com/what-is-data-science-at-lyft-4101a69be028).
 
**Rust and Node.js: A match made in heaven**  
https://blog.logrocket.com/rust-and-node-js-a-match-made-in-heaven/  
As great as worker threads are, JavaScript is still slow. Moreover, worker thread are not available in all supported LTS versions of Node. Fortunately, we can use Rust to build a native add-on for Node.js. FFI is another alternative, but it’s slower than the add-on approach. Rust is blazing fast and has fearless concurrency. Since Rust has a very small runtime (or “not runtime”), our binary size should also be pretty small.

**To Microservices and Back Again - Why Segment Went Back to a Monolith**  
https://www.infoq.com/news/2020/04/microservices-back-again/  
Microservices were first introduced to address the limited fault isolation of Segment's monolith. However, as the company became more successful, and integrated with more external services, the operational overhead of supporting microservices became too much to bear. The decision to move back to a monolith came with a new architecture that considered the pain points around scaling related to company growth.

**The Ingredients of Real World Robotic Reinforcement Learning**  
https://bair.berkeley.edu/blog/2020/04/27/ingredients/  
Robots have been useful in environments that can be carefully controlled, such as those commonly found in industrial settings (e.g. assembly lines). However, in unstructured settings like the home, we need robotic systems that are adaptive to the diversity of the real world.

**Rules of thumb for a 1x developer**  
https://muldoon.cloud/programming/2020/04/17/programming-rules-thumb.html  
I’m not a 10x developer. I haven’t been building websites since the days of dialup. I picked up programming a few years out of college because I was at a dead end in my career in government and politics. So I’ve been writing code 9-5 for about five years, all of which have been at Amazon. And during that time, I also raised three kids – who were aged 0, 0, and 2 when I started. So I was not That Guy overachieving on nights and weekends. I was taking care of my family. I contributed to my first open-source project about a year ago. That was my first ever side project. And it was a conference website. I have never read a book cover-to-cover on software engineering. In summary, I am a 1x developer. I do enough to get by respectably.

**Designing Emotional UI**  
https://uxplanet.org/designing-emotional-ui-b11fa0fda5c  
Emotions play a massive role in our life. People are both rational and emotional. And when it comes to digital products, many people want to interact with digital devices the same way they interact with other people. It’s no longer enough to create products with good usability; it’s equally important to spark positive emotional reactions into the hearts of users. In this article, I want to focus on small details that designers can introduce in their product to make users feel good.
