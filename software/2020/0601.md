[译]软件吃软件，编程工作会越来越多吗？ http://www.ruanyifeng.com/blog/2020/05/will-programmers-increase.html  
This topic is really too big to fit in a single newsletter, and we are already at more than a thousand words. On the one hand, I do welcome these changes. I fundamentally believe that I’ve lucked into the technology industry, and many of the opportunities I’ve exploited were available to me because only I was in the right room at the right time, a few times quite literally so.

**Rediscovering the Small Web**  
https://neustadt.fr/essays/the-small-web/  
Google Is Not God of The Web https://bilge.world/google-page-experience  
Most websites today are built like commercial products by professionals and marketers, optimised to draw the largest audience, generate engagement and 'convert'. But there is also a smaller, less-visible web designed by regular people to simply to share their interests and hobbies with the world. A web that is unpolished, often quirky but often also fun, creative and interesting.

**The Web We Lost: Volume One**  
http://www.zeldman.com/2020/05/29/the-web-we-lost-volume-one/

https://stackoverflow.blog/2020/05/29/why-kubernetes-getting-so-popular/

We’re eager to share with the public some of the interesting statistics and changes reflected in this data, but we also understand that it’s important to be humble and realistic: a lot of the answers developers gave might look very different if the same survey were conducted today.

https://deniseyu.io/2020/05/23/habits-of-high-performing-teams.html  
I often struggle to explain what it means to be part of a high-functioning software team. Sure, there are mountains of literature, and an entire genre of LinkedIn thought leadership that professes all kinds of guidelines and heuristics about what makes teams work, but in my experience, it’s hard to internalize these ideas and follow someone else’s model if you’ve never seen what good looks like. In this post, I’ll try to document the characteristics and habits of the highest-performing teams I’ve been on.
