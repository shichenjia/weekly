## 本期看点

**What is Developer Experience (DX)?**  
https://css-tricks.com/what-is-developer-experience-dx/  
Developer Experience¹ is a term² with a self-declaring meaning — the experience of developers — but it eludes definition in the sense that people invoke it at different times for different reasons referring to different things. For instance, our own Sarah Drasner’s current job title is “VP of Developer Experience” at Netlify, so it’s a very real thing. But a job title is just one way the term is used. Let’s dig in a bit and apply it to the different ways people think about and use the term.

**How many of you know deep down that the team is working on something that no customer wants?**  
https://iism.org/article/how-many-of-you-know-deep-down-that-the-team-is-working-on-something-that-no-customer-wants-54  
What just happened is a new software product/feature was created that no customer wanted. This happens way too often. In fact, most hyper important software projects that must be done by date certain or else, have deep flaws that cause some variation of this phenomenon, flaws that include: Not wanted, No Rarity, Incorrect Packaging, Incorrect Pricing.

**对 aPaaS 的产品认知**  
https://www.yuque.com/xufei-coder/code/stalzt  
近年来，aPaaS 这样的概念逐渐火热，借此机会，正好把自己领悟的产品观简单总结一下。小型工具 SaaS 的生存难度很高。我们可以看下这几年最火的两个小型 SaaS: Airtable、Notion，从它火爆的结果里面寻找原因。之所以这两家火，并不是仅仅它们的产品体验只是满足了表象上的“好”，其最大价值是，有希望成为小微企业的“业务中台”。这两个产品，看上去跟什么中台一点关系都没有，为什么要说他们能成为一种业务中台？本文将从某些角度阐述以 aPaaS 形态作为业务中台的价值，并尝试用上述两个产品为例，解答这个问题。另附：[从前端角度看企业软件的研发过程](https://www.yuque.com/xufei-coder/code/fd0gv5)。

**如何挑选数据可视化框架及平台 - 前端篇**  
https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/149398216  
虽然有很多开源图表库，但绝大部分不是已经弃坑就是将要弃坑了，目前真正能用的就只有 ECharts、Ploty.js、Vega 和 G2。后续会不会出现更好的前端图表库？恐怕不会了，前面提到很多图表库的成功背后都赶上了技术变革。图表库商业产品不多，毕竟这个需求很通用，难以差异化竞争，对客户来说都是花钱，为啥不选最好那个？加上有 Echarts 这种赶上商业质量的开源库存在，能满足大部分的需求了，使得商业产品的生存空间有限。如果选商业产品，国内使用最好在 Highcharts、amCharts 和 AnyChart 之间做选择，因为 FusionCharts 好像还不支持中文，不过需要注意这些产品的地图都有错误，把某个省当成国家了，用的时候需要改一下。

**Matlab被禁感悟：把东西做出来，而不是追求把论文发出来**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/yZkjFLN4-xX0OamUtRoihQ  
最后总结一下，当我们在思考如何解“Matlab被禁这个解燃眉之急的同时，更需要考虑如何才能在未来做出像Matlab那样的工作，做出能卡别人脖子的技术。这需要我们做出改变，观念上的改变，行动上的改变。至于哪些具体的改变，我想前面梳理的四点就算是抛砖引玉吧：（1）把东西做出来，而不是追求把论文发出来，（2）把东西用起来，而不是做完就扔了，（3）把教学场景用起来，而不是把教学当作负担，（4）把持久战意识树立起来，而不是期望速胜论。其实，这里的东西适用于所有工具、类库、产品。另附：[SageMath - Creating a viable free open source alternative to Magma, Maple, Mathematica and Matlab](https://www.sagemath.org/)

**Compiler Compiler: A Twitch series about working on a JavaScript engine**  
https://hacks.mozilla.org/2020/06/compiler-compiler-working-on-a-javascript-engine/  
JavaScript …is a programming language. Some people love it, others don’t.  JavaScript might be a bit messy, but it’s easy to get started with. It’s the programming language that taught me how to program and introduced me to the wider world of programming languages. So, it has a special place in my heart. As I taught myself, I realized that other people were probably facing a lot of the same struggles as I was. And really that is what Compiler Compiler is about.

**The Return of the 90s Web**  
https://mxb.dev/blog/the-return-of-the-90s-web/  
In big cultural concepts like music or fashion, things have a way of coming around full circle. I'm pretty sure someday grunge will come back as a hot new sample, and at some point our kids might think frosted hair tips are totally cool. When I look at some of the trends on the web today, I wonder if we’re at that point yet. I wonder if we’re ready to revisit some of the ideas of the early web again.

**替代 webpack？带你了解 snowpack 原理，你还学得动么**  
https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/149351900  
近期，随着 vue3 的各种曝光，vite 的热度上升，与 vite 类似的 snowpack 的关注度也逐渐增加了。目前（2020.06.18）snowpack 在 Github 上已经有了将近 1w stars。snowpack 的代码很轻量，本文会从实现原理的角度介绍 snowpack 的特点。同时，带大家一起看看，作为一个以原生 JavaScript 模块化为核心的年轻的构建工具，它是如何实现“老牌”构建工具所提供的那些特性的。另附：[v1.2: spack: Yet another asset bundler](https://swc-project.github.io/blog/2020/06/18/swc-1.2.html).

**适用于既有大型MPA项目的“微前端”方案**  
https://tech.youzan.com/gua-yong-yu-ji-you-da-xing-mpaxiang-mu-de-wei-qian-duan-fang-an/  
微前端的定义想必大家都看了很多，大多数是起源自于micro-frontends.org和各个大牛自己的独到见解。本文所介绍的方案并非全套的微前端方案，不包含独立发布、部署、依赖拆分这一部分的内容。这次分享的目标是以有赞微商城后台的改造为例，提供一些可参考的经验，如何在一个已经完成独立发布、部署的MPA体系下，实现微前端中的子页面分发和组合的部分，实现接近单页的效果。

**Everything You Need to Know About FLIP Animations in React**  
https://css-tricks.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-flip-animations-in-react/  
With a very recent Safari update, Web Animations API (WAAPI) is now supported without a flag in all modern browsers (except IE). The WAAPI is a nice way to do animation (that needs to be done in JavaScript) because it’s native — meaning it requires no additional libraries to work. One of the most efficient approaches to animation is FLIP. FLIP requires a bit of JavaScript to do its thing. Let’s take a look at the intersection of using the WAAPI, FLIP, and integrating all that into React. But we’ll start without React first, then get to that.

**How do you create a video chat application?**  
https://blog.phuaxueyong.com/post/2020-06-15-how-to-make-a-video-chat-app/  
Common video applications utilize this technology call WebRTC. WebRTC has been a technology of late to allow developers to exchange data and even media across the web with the use of your every day internet browser. This has been a technological transformation of the decade given how such functions are only available as plugins such as flush plugins. Even if you have not heard of WebRTC, you probably already used it before. They are used in Whatapps, Facebook, and even Google handout etc. It is called Web Real-Time communication that allows you to have a direct connection between browsers. This technology has been around for at least 7 years already but I finally caught up! I managed to create my own WebRTC application to get my hands dirty to understand the tool better. 另附：[Real-Time Communication in Web Development](https://medium.com/javascript-in-plain-english/real-time-communication-in-web-development-24b669ced0ed)、[Build a simple chat app with Deno and a WYSIWYG editor](https://www.tiny.cloud/blog/deno-app-build-chat-app-wysiwyg-html-editor/).

**Web Engine Diversity and Ecosystem Health**  
https://bkardell.com/blog/EcosystemHealth.html  
For many years, we've seen lots of blog posts and conversation on the topic of "browser engine diversity". I'd like to offer a slightly tilted view of this based instead on "the health of the ecosystem", and explain why I think this is more valuable measure and way to discuss these topics.

**Front End Developer vs Back End Developer – Definition and Meaning In Practice**  
https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/front-end-developer-vs-back-end-developer-definition-and-meaning-in-practice/  
Websites and applications are complex! Buttons and images are just the tip of the iceberg. With this kind of complexity, you need people to manage it, but which parts are the front end developers and back end developers responsible for?

**Best Practices: API Design**  
https://codeburst.io/best-practices-api-design-61d4697d17ff  
Well designed APIs = Happy Developers 😃 Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) are interfaces that make it easy for applications to use data & resources of another application. They are vital to the success of a product or company. Without APIs, most of your favorite software wouldn’t exist today. For example, the Google Maps API lets you use Google Maps in your mobile or web application. Without it, you would have to design & develop your own maps database! Imagine the time it would take to display a location on the map if there was no API.

**Why we switched from Yarn to pnpm**  
https://www.takeshape.io/articles/why-we-switched-from-yarn-to-pnpm/  
Yarn and pnpm are both popular alternatives to npm but why would you switch from one to the other? Improved performance in a monorepo situation.

**Fast 2D rendering on GPU**  
https://raphlinus.github.io/rust/graphics/gpu/2020/06/13/fast-2d-rendering.html  
Previously on my quest for fast rendering of 2D vector graphics on GPU, I have posted a piet-gpu update and a deeper exploration into a sort-middle architecture. These intermediate results showed promise, but fell short of my vision for truly high performance 2D GPU rendering. I am now pleased to present an architecture that I believe does realize this vision. 另附：[3K, 60fps, 130ms: achieving it with Rust](https://blog.tonari.no/why-we-love-rust).

**ASIC Clouds: Specializing the Datacenter for Planet-Scale Applications**  
https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2020/7/245704-asic-clouds/fulltext. 
Planet-scale applications are driving the exponential growth of the Cloud, and datacenter specialization is the key enabler of this trend. GPU- and FPGA-based clouds have already been deployed to accelerate compute-intensive workloads. ASIC-based clouds are a natural evolution as cloud services expand across the planet. ASIC Clouds are purpose-built datacenters comprised of large arrays of ASIC accelerators that optimize the total cost of ownership (TCO) of large, high-volume scale-out computations. On the surface, ASIC Clouds may seem improbable due to high NREs and ASIC inflexibility, but large-scale ASIC Clouds have already been deployed for the Bitcoin cryptocurrency system. This paper distills lessons from these Bitcoin ASIC Clouds and applies them to other large scale workloads such as YouTube-style video-transcoding and Deep Learning, showing superior TCO versus CPU and GPU. It derives Pareto-optimal ASIC Cloud servers based on accelerator properties, by jointly optimizing ASIC architecture, DRAM, motherboard, power delivery, cooling, and operating voltage. Finally, the authors examine the impact of ASIC NRE and when it makes sense to build an ASIC Cloud.

**Convergent Evolution, CDNs and the Cloud**  
https://redmonk.com/sogrady/2020/06/10/convergent-evolution-cdns-cloud/  
But with the demand for CDN capabilities robust and constant, all of the major cloud services have launched their own native functionality (AWS CloudFront, Azure CDN, Google Cloud CDN) – though it should be noted that customers, particularly large ones, still generally prefer specialized providers for their CDN needs. The CDNs have also been facing competition from the hyperscale providers around static site hosting. 另附：[一文看懂静态资源服务沉浮及其在携程的演进](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/Tlt1ZZ0wPTgt67KybZCL1w)

**Google Serverless Gripes**  
https://medium.com/@dweekly/google-serverless-gripes-f447f0a7fdfa  
I’m a former Googler and ran product for our Datacenter Software team, so I’ve gotten to get the inside-track on Google Cloud’s inner workings, but I still find the current set of serverless offerings frustratingly limited when looking at options for my startup’s backend services. I’m all in on Google but I wish Google was all-in on serverless and had better offerings to help startups like ours thrive.

**Go - The Next Step for Generics**  
https://blog.golang.org/generics-next-step  
We’ve been continuing to refine the [generics design draft](https://go.googlesource.com/proposal/+/refs/heads/master/design/go2draft-contracts.md). We’ve written a type checker for it: a program that can parse Go code that uses generics as described in the design draft and report any type errors. We’ve written example code. And we’ve collected feedback from many, many people—thanks for providing it! Based on what we’ve learned, we’re releasing an [updated design draft](https://go.googlesource.com/proposal/+/refs/heads/master/design/go2draft-type-parameters.md). The biggest change is that we are dropping the idea of contracts. 另附：[Pkg.go.dev is open source!](https://blog.golang.org/pkgsite)

**Image GPT**  
https://openai.com/blog/image-gpt/  
We find that, just as a large transformer model trained on language can generate coherent text, the same exact model trained on pixel sequences can generate coherent image completions and samples. By establishing a correlation between sample quality and image classification accuracy, we show that our best generative model also contains features competitive with top convolutional nets in the unsupervised setting.

**GitHub isn't fun anymore**  
https://jaredpalmer.com/github-isnt-fun-anymore  
At first I thought it was just me getting older and more experienced. But after several conversations about it with colleagues and other open source maintainers, I’m not the only one who feels this way. The old Trending algorithm was definitely flawed, but it was simple, objective, and ever so slightly ruthless. It heavily skewed toward JavaScript and web development, but under-indexed a lot of backend and AI stuff.

**Adobe to remove Flash Player from web site after December 2020**  
https://www.adobe.com/products/flashplayer/end-of-life.html  
Open standards such as HTML5, WebGL, and WebAssembly have continually matured over the years and serve as viable alternatives for Flash content. Also, the major browser vendors are integrating these open standards into their browsers and deprecating most other plug-ins (like Adobe Flash Player).By announcing our business decision in 2017, with three years’ advance notice, we believed that would allow sufficient time for developers, designers, businesses, and other parties to migrate existing Flash content as needed to new, open standards

**Bootstrap 5 alpha!**  
https://blog.getbootstrap.com/2020/06/16/bootstrap-5-alpha/  
We’ve been focused on making the migration from v4 to v5 more approachable, but we’ve also not been afraid to step away from what’s outdated or no longer appropriate. As such, we’re very happy to say that with v5, Bootstrap no longer depends on jQuery and we’ve dropped support for Internet Explorer. We’re sharpening our focus on building tools that are more future-friendly, and while we’re not fully there yet, the promise of CSS variables, faster JavaScript, fewer dependencies, and better APIs certainly feel right to us.

**Why Figma Wins**  
https://kwokchain.com/2020/06/19/why-figma-wins/  
The core insight of Figma is that design is larger than just designers. Design is all of the conversations between designers and PMs about what to build. It is the mocks and prototypes and the feedback on them. It is the handoff of specs and assets to engineers and how easy it is for them to implement them. Building for this entire process doesn’t take away the importance of designers—it gives them a seat at the table for the core decisions a company makes.

**把员工带向幸福，是领导者的首要能力**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/3eejxK-Pl3MrTGgaD4UEfw  
以前，人类是靠掠夺、侵占来争夺生存资源的，今天，基于商业的发展，每个人都要从团队合作、研发产品、提供服务等事情中，去创造价值。人类今天的能力已经空前加强了，如果人类不接受利他思维，而是以自利的思维，以侵害对方利益来获取自己利益的思维去生活，那么，整个世界都会充满不稳定的因素。因此我认为，“利他”是人类文明发展的一个大趋势。如果人类能够接受利他哲学，人类就会开启一个新的文明。

创业哪些是不变的，不变的是用产品去试市场，变的是技术、需求和市场变化。这里这张表是对我刚才前面分析简单的总结，大家可以看到它带来的更多是机会，局部确实有风险，我们要充分估计风险的范围和时间段，最好能够做到最坏情况的准备，能够灵活地应急。做到这样的话，可以解除我们的焦虑，可以更有信心地从“想得更明白”，到“做得更有效”。“做得更有效”就是核心要抓住这不变的游戏规则，这不变的就是要活得足够长，来不断地快速迭代，找到产品市场匹配。这里最重要的是创业者，创业者做得更有效是最为核心的要素。

**​揭秘618：一场横跨十年的“供应链战争”**

京东刚刚转战电商的时候，提出的使命是：让生活变得简单、快乐。后来，京东把使命改为：科技引领生活。就在2020年5月，刘强东发了一篇6000字长文内部信，把京东的使命改成了：技术为本，致力于更高效和可持续的世界。当然，“使命”二字在局外人看来未免鸡血，不能强求感同身受。但是无论是新冠疫情中的物资运输，还是618狂欢消费复苏，没人能否认，京东已经把“供应链”嵌入了我们的生活。如果在京东上购物更便宜，更快，可以让很多人真实地获益。如果把一座城池比喻成生命，“供应链”就是它依赖的“生命维持系统”。这次疫情就像突如其来的冰河世纪，把你我封印在家。但是无论天寒地冻，在生命体内，鲜血从不停止奔涌。据此，这场“供应链战争”，不仅和京东的18000位工程师有关，更和你我有关。
