**I was wrong. CRDTs are the future**  
https://josephg.com/blog/crdts-are-the-future/  
Thanks to people like Martin, we now know how to make good CRDTs. But there’s still a lot of code to write before local first software can become the default. OT - you’re clever and fascinating, but CRDTs can do things you were never capable of. And CRDTs need me. With some good implementations, I think we can make something really special. I mourn all the work I’ve done on OT over the years. But OT is no longer fits into the vision I have for the future. CRDTs would let us remake Wave, but simpler and better. And they would let us write software that treats users as digital citizens, not a digital serfs. The time to build is now.
 
**Things I Was Wrong About: Types**  
https://v5.chriskrycho.com/journal/things-i-was-wrong-about/1-types/  
Because it would do us all good to be a little more honest about where we’ve changed our minds or simply been mistaken.

**Seeing the road ahead — Catseyes and iterative design**  
https://blog.scottlogic.com/2020/09/25/Iterative-design-catseyes.html  
The iterative design approach is vital to ensuring that your product is successful, resilient, and addresses the problem, and, as the example above with Catseyes shows, can be used in a variety of scenarios. Hopefully the above should inspire you to approach new projects with the confidence and tools to advocate for iterative design, and I hope that, by doing so, you can continue to help advocate its worth to everyone who is involved in production.

**Exploring Node.js Async Hooks**  
https://blog.appsignal.com/2020/09/30/exploring-nodejs-async-hooks.html  
In short, Node.js async hooks, more specifically the async_hooks module, provides a clear and easy-to-use API to track async resources in Node.js. In its simplest form, the API can be accessed by simply typing the good old JavaScript require import:

**Debugging Browsers – Tools and Techniques**  
https://textslashplain.com/2020/09/29/debugging-browsers-tools-and-techniques/  
Earlier this year, I shared a post on how you can become an expert on web browsers from the comfort of your desk… or anywhere else you have an internet connection. In that post, I mostly covered how to search through the source, review issue reports, and find design documentation. I also provided a long list of browser experts you might consider following on Twitter. In today’s post, I’d like to give a quick summary of some of the tools and techniques I use for diagnosing browser problems.

**JQuery to React: How we rewrote the HelloSign Editor**  
https://dropbox.tech/application/jquery-to-react--how-we-rewrote-the-hellosign-editor  
HelloSign is a Dropbox company that provides a Web-based eSignature solution. The three modes in which a document is presented—the Editor, the Signer app, and the final overlay as a single, immutable record for posterity—must each display their contents onscreen in pixel-perfect layout at each step, regardless of who’s looking at them on what. Otherwise, users at both ends may not trust the system as much as they would handwritten ink on paper.

**聊聊前端 UI 组件：组件特征**  
https://ourai.ws/posts/the-features-of-frontend-ui-components/  
本文的主要内容是根据特征对前端 UI 组件进行建模，让我们尽可能充分地了解它的方方面面，并为如何设计以及建立一个组件体系打下基础。

**[译]成为最差前端开发的10个建议**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/O6L3e84iV2P9up2viyIwwg  
我经常看到很多人写文章，就职业选择、面试技巧或如何成为优秀程序员等针对开发人员的主题提出建议。我觉得换一种思路，反其道而行之也可以让你大开眼界，让大家知道该对什么事情敬而远之，或者该专注于哪些领域。

**生活在 DOM 树上**  
https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/261056969  
现代前端以 Atwood 的一句「凡是能用 JavaScript 实现的，最终都会用 JavaScript 实现」为嚆矢。滥觞于公司与社区传统的鄙视链正失去它们的借鉴意义。但面对看似无垠的 node_modules，我想循 Donald Knuth「过早优化乃万恶之源」的敏捷好过过早地振翮...

**To Eleventy and Beyond**  
https://hacks.mozilla.org/2020/10/to-eleventy-and-beyond/  
Porting to Eleventy has been a positive change. It certainly took quite a lot of steps to get there, but it was worth the effort. In the past, long build times with Jekyll made this site really painful for contributors and document authors to work with. We’re already starting to see some additional contributions as a result of lowering the barrier of entry. If you have a site running under Jekyll or are considering using a modern static site generator, then taking a look at Eleventy is highly recommended. It’s fast, flexible, well documented, and a joy to work with.

**TypeScript to WebAssembly: The What, The How And The Why**  
https://blog.bitsrc.io/typescript-to-webassembly-the-what-the-how-and-the-why-3916a2561d37  
The learning curve for WASM is very steep. This sometimes scares people away from it. AssemblyScript is a perfect way of writing compatible code if you already know TypeScript.

**Practical Serverless: Long-Running Workflows with Human Interactions using Step Functions and Ballerina**  
https://medium.com/ballerina-techblog/practical-serverless-long-running-workflows-with-human-interactions-using-step-functions-and-dd6fbcb42f29  
In this article, we will take a look at how to create long-running workflows using AWS Step Functions and the Ballerina language. AWS Step Functions allow us to define state machines that can have tasks such as executing a Lambda function, inserting a message to a queue using AWS Simple Queue Service (SQS), messaging with AWS Simple Notification Service (SNS), and more. This also encourages reusability by allowing existing services or functions to be composed. You can have rules for defining functionality such as error handling, automatic retry, and parallel processing.

**Introducing Cloudflare Radar**  
https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-cloudflare-radar/  
And by blocking 72 billion cyberthreats every day Cloudflare also has a unique position in understanding and mitigating Internet threats. Our goal is to help build a better Internet and we want to do this by exposing insights, threats and trends based on the aggregated data that we have. We want to help anyone understand what is happening on the Internet from a security, performance and usage perspective. Every Internet user should have easy access to answer the questions that they have. There are three key components that we’re launching today: Radar Internet Insights, Radar Domain Insights and Radar IP Insights.

**grep-3.5 released**  
http://savannah.gnu.org/forum/forum.php?forum_id=9820  
The message that a binary file matches is now sent to standard error and the message has been reworded from "Binary file FOO matches" to "grep: FOO: binary file matches", to avoid confusion with ordinary output or when file names contain spaces and the like, and to be more consistent with other diagnostics.
	
**Rust 2021: GUI**  
https://raphlinus.github.io/rust/druid/2020/09/28/rust-2021.html  
I believe there is great potential for a high-quality GUI toolkit in Rust. At the same time, it’s an incredibly ambitious task. Subtasks within it, for example accelerated GPU drawing and text layout, are in and of themselves incredibly ambitious tasks. I wouldn’t consider a toolkit “ready” for production use until it supported accessibility, and as far as I know there is nothing in the Rust space even starting to work on this. Yet, perhaps against my better judgment, I find myself devoting most of my time and energy towards building GUI in Rust. In this post I will set out my hopes but also frankly discuss the challenges. Releated: [RustStarterKit2020](https://wiki.alopex.li/RustStarterKit2020), [Supercharge your Electron apps with Rust](https://blog.logrocket.com/supercharge-your-electron-apps-with-rust/).

**The open source paradox**  
http://antirez.com/news/134  
Open source is different, it’s an artifact, it’s a transposition in code of what you really want to do, of what you feel software should be, or just of all your fun and joy, or even anger you are feeling while coding. And you want it to rock, to be perfect, and you can’t sleep at night if there is a fucking heisenbug. So if a user of your software is addressing you because some part of your code sucks, and is willing to work with you to do something about it, and is very demanding, don’t think they are abusing you because they are not paying you. It’s not about money. You can ignore bugs if you want, and ignore their complains, you can do that since you don’t have a contract to do otherwise, but they are helping you, they care about the same thing you care: your software quality, grandiosity, perfection.

**Writing a book: is it worth it?**  
https://martin.kleppmann.com/2020/09/29/is-book-writing-worth-it.html  
On balance, I do think that writing a technical book is worth it. The feeling of knowing that you have helped a lot of people is gratifying. The personal growth that comes from taking on such a challenge is also considerable. And there is no better way to learn something in depth than by explaining it to others. In my next post I will provide some advice on writing and publishing from my experience so far.
