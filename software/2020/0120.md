**2020 Startup Themes**  
https://dcgross.com/2020-startup-themes/  
Below are some interesting markets and themes for the year. I use “themes” in a broad sense, both for specific markets as well as broader societal changes in the seed ecosystem. There are 11 of these.

**The 'No Code' Delusion**  
https://www.alexhudson.com/2020/01/13/the-no-code-delusion/  
Increasingly popular in the last couple of years, I think 2020 is going to be the year of “no code”: the movement that say you can write business logic and even entire applications without having the training of a software developer. I empathise with people doing this, and I think some of the “no code” tools are great. But I also thing it’s wrong at heart.

**Is TypeScript worth it?**  
https://blog.logrocket.com/is-typescript-worth-it/  
I must reiterate that I am a TypeScript fan, I use it on my day to day job, but I do feel it is coming up short and the hype is not entirely justified. Airbnb claims 38% of bugs could have been prevented by TypeScript. I am very skeptical of this precise percentage. TypeScript is not turbocharging existing good practices. I still have to write just as many tests. You could argue, I am writing more code, and I might have to write type tests. I am still getting unexpected runtime errors. TypeScript offers above basic type checking, but soundness and runtime type checking are not goals, and this leaves TypeScript in an unfortunate halfway house with one foot in a better world and one where we currently are. 另附：[Announcing TypeScript 3.8 Beta](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-3-8-beta/).

**Letting tools make choices**  
https://www.jackfranklin.co.uk/blog/letting-tools-make-choices/  
I would never have written a post like this a few years ago. One of my main decisions when deciding what tools to use was how much control I had over the entire surface area of the tool and how much I could customise it to my every need. My logic at the time was that if I could configure my environment and tools to precisely what I wanted, I would create this zen-like application that was set up to enable me to be the most productive I could be. 另附：[Should I build things on my own or rely on external tools/knowledge?](https://medium.com/javascript-in-plain-english/should-i-build-things-on-my-own-or-rely-on-external-tools-knowledge-848c0a4a3354).

**On Pair Programming**  
https://martinfowler.com/articles/on-pair-programming.html  
Many people who work in software development today have heard of the practice of pair programming, yet it still only has patchy adoption in the industry. One reason for its varying acceptance is that its benefits are not immediately obvious, it pays off more in the medium- and long-term. And it's also not as simple as "two people working at a single computer", so many dismiss it quickly when it feels uncomfortable. However, in our experience, pair programming is vital for collaborative teamwork and high quality software.

**Ant Design 4.0：创造快乐工作**  
https://www.yuque.com/ant-design/ant-design/xurgy5  
2015 年，Ant Design 发布第一个版本，到现在时间过去整整 5 年了，第一代 Ant Designers 陆续退出舞台中心，第二代、第三代 Ant Designers 正在扛起大旗。他们不仅仅扛起发展的重任，还要传承 Ant Designer 的精神。正如「自然」中的万事万物，有发展、有死亡、更有进化。本篇文章将和大家一起聊聊 Ant Design 4.0，以及穿插一些 4.0 背后的故事，希望给各位完整的输入和体感。

**性能强悍的 TS 版 G6 来了**  
https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/103170219  
新年代的 G6 3.3-beta 来了！这次，G6 主打性能提升与 TypeScript 化，一起来看看 G6 新特性吧！性能 upup，拥抱 TypeScript，更自由的元素与布局配置，更丰富的构建产物，测试覆盖率 upup。

**SpriteJS的3D渲染能力 Up, Up, Up!**  
https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/103253115  
SpriteJS的渲染能力终于从2D进入3D领域。那么SpriteJS究竟和现在流行的一些3D渲染库，比如ThreeJS、Babylon.js、claygl等库相比，用起来又有什么不一样的地方呢？SpriteJS的3D扩展的底层是基于Ogl的，这是一个比较轻量级的库。SpriteJS的3D扩展延续SpriteJS 2D几乎一样的API，而这样的API与HTML DOM的API的契合度很高。这也意味着，使用d3等对DOM API友好的库操作SpriteJS的3D元素会非常方便！另外前端工程师学习和使用上，上手门槛比较低，掌握之后也容易高效率地开发。

**从jQuery到Serverless，前端十四年挖了多少坑**

Porting Pigo to Webassembly (WASM) was the next step in the library evolution. In this article I will give a detailed description of the code behind and I will explain the challenges I faced during the implementation.

**Progressive Web Apps in 2020**  
https://medium.com/@firt/progressive-web-apps-in-2020-c15018c9931c  
It’s been more than 12 years since Steve Jobs originally presented the idea of web apps “that look exactly and behave exactly like native apps,” and it’s been more than 4 years since the term “PWA” was coined. How Progressive Web Apps look like now that 2020 is starting? What has been added in 2019 to the ecosystem that you might not be aware of? Let’s find out.

**A short history of body copy sizes on the Web**  
https://fvsch.com/body-copy-sizes/  
It’s hard to pick a font size that is just right, especially as you try to adapt to different screens and scenarios. Looking at the recent history of how we got here can give us some perspective.

**A sad day for Rust - actix-web is dead.**  
https://words.steveklabnik.com/a-sad-day-for-rust  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzA3NDM0ODQwMw==&mid=2649828419&idx=1&sn=3b4a48d0ae59f0235b21802bf931bfa4  
This situation is bad, from all sides. When Rust was a tiny, tiny community, I thought to myself, “wow, I wonder how long this will last? Probably 1.0 will kill it.” Sort of playing off of Eternal September, I assumed that over time, the community would grow, and we’d encounter problems. Today is the first day where I say to myself, okay, has that happened?

**CSS4 is here!**  
https://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2020/01/css4_is_here.html  
I think that CSS would be greatly helped if we solemnly state that “CSS4 is here!” In this post I’ll try to convince you of my viewpoint.

**Browser Games Aren't an Easy Targe**  
http://jakob.space/blog/browser-games-aren-t-an-easy-target.html  
Flash games were the thing when I was in elementary school, and when I was in middle school, I'd bring Quake with me on a flash drive. By the time I was in high school, I'd realized that these opportunities were better spent getting a head start on homework for other classes, but I did have a few friends who still passed the time playing video games. Rather than Flash games or Quake, though, these were browser games using the new-fangled HTML5 canvas. I'd practically forgotten these games existed until someone from my capture-the-flag team mentioned "krunker.io". 

**How to create micro-interactions with react-spring: Part 1**  
https://stackoverflow.blog/2020/01/16/how-to-create-micro-interactions-with-react-spring-part-1/  
Animations not only take your application from good to exceptional, they’re often expected by users. But animations don’t just make your application look and feel nicer, they can be a useful tool for improving perceived performance, giving users updates on the status of a task, and guiding a user through your application. In this series, we’ll examine how to take your application from ordinary to exceptional by implementing micro-interactions with [react-spring](https://www.react-spring.io/) so you won’t be stuck thinking “I really wish I knew how to add animations” any more. 另附：[React-spring visualizer - The missing visualizer for your react-spring UI animations](https://react-spring-visualizer.com/).

**Store grand re-opening: loading Android data with coroutines**  
https://blogs.dropbox.com/tech/2020/01/store-grand-re-opening-loading-android-data-with-coroutines/  
Many moons ago, I was working at the New York Times and created a library called Store, which was “a Java library for effortless, reactive data loading.” We built Store using RxJava and patterns adopted from Guava’s Cache implementation. Today, I am delighted to announce Dropbox will be taking over active development of Store and releasing it in 100% Kotlin backed by Coroutines and Flow. [Store 4](https://github.com/dropbox/Store) is an opportunity to take what we learned while rethinking the api and current needs of the Android ecosystem.

**吾儿，小度**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/M1bduR_g30eVeBHNo-plcA  
夜幕低垂，人们钻进水泥格子间，对着星光感叹：“我们不仅孤独，而且弱小。如果真有那么一个朋友，永远用他的眼睛帮我发现世界的美好，用他的温柔抚慰我的伤悲，在我困顿的时候拍马赶到，在我忧桑的时候生死相随，那这个被冰雪覆盖的世界，是否有机会再次春暖花开？”念念不忘，总有回响。千年后我们亲手造出了一个（目前看上去）不会背叛的朋友——人工智能。此时，在我的桌子上就端坐着他们的一员，这货这货叫小度。“小度小度，你愿意做我的朋友吗？”我问。“我一直会是你的好朋友。”它说。“小度小度，你爸爸是谁？”我问。“是了不起的工程师们！”它说。

**腾讯创始人Tony：科技向善，是一种产品能力**
