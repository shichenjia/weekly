## 本期看点

**五年之后的前端会是什么样？**  
https://www.zhihu.com/question/357592204/answer/1469977905  
预测行业未来的发展，是一件很难的事情，但却是一种很好的思维训练。可以锻炼从业者看待问题的方式。前端行业也许尚未找到一个统一的 “理论模型” 对未来进行预测，不然这样的疑问可能就不会出现了，就像自由落体运动一样，人们会非常信服根据模型计算出来的结果。因此，在没有一个合理的模型能被使用之前，我们只能从推理的角度来进行一些分析了，这有点类似于侦破一个案件。下面我们来梳理一下这样的线索，我打算从以下 4 个角度来进行观察。
来看一看这些年来发生事情，是否能从中寻到一些蛛丝马迹。

**Open your eyes to APIs**  
https://blog.scottlogic.com/2020/09/10/open-your-eyes-to-apis.html  
Imagine using your smartphone solely to make telephone calls. Just imagine. But it’s quite possible that your organisation is doing the equivalent of that. There’s a specific technical capability which already exists within your organisation, but it’s likely that you’re only using a fraction of its potential. I’m talking about the humble API.

**Web Brutalism, Seamfulness, and Notion**  
https://www.viget.com/articles/web-brutalism-seamfulness-and-notion/  
How a tool for sensemaking reconciles two distinct software design ideologies. This is the essence and opportunity of Web Brutalism: more than a utilitarian aesthetic, it’s a way of creating spaces for thought and expression on the web that reflect the nature of thought and the web. The best tools — digital or otherwise — give enough structure and flexibility for the task at hand. When that task is thinking, the best tools reflect the way that thinking happens, a meandering, back-and-forth process of exploring and refining our hunches and questions and notions.

**Communicating with Interactive Articles**  
https://distill.pub/2020/communicating-with-interactive-articles/  
Examining the design of interactive articles by synthesizing theory from disciplines such as education, journalism, and visualization.

**Moon.js - The purely functional user interface library that's fast, tiny, and intuitive.**  
https://moonjs.org/  
Moon is a novel approach to web applications based on pure functions. An application is a function that uses drivers, programs that provide an interface to the real world. These functions take input from drivers and return output to drivers. Drivers can be responsible for things like views, state, audio, HTTP requests, routing, and timing events.

**Angular localization with Ivy**  
https://blog.angular.io/angular-localization-with-ivy-4d8becefb6aa  
Part of the new Angular rendering engine, Ivy, includes a new approach to localizing applications — specifically extracting and translating text. This article explains the benefits and some of the implementation of this new approach.
Prior to Ivy, the only way to add localizable messages to an Angular application was to mark them in component templates using the i18n attribute.

**"Flutter Is To Apps As Unity Is To Games" - Tim Sneath**  
https://hackernoon.com/flutter-is-to-apps-as-unity-is-to-games-tim-sneath-4e213w4l  
We talked with Tim Sneath, Google's product manager for Flutter and Dart, about how both the language and the framework have evolved over the last two years, how they're being used today, and where they're headed. Releated: [Flutter — The Next Big Thing!](https://medium.com/@gp.greatworld/flutter-the-next-big-thing-b7b901d1fd1b), [eBay Motors: Accelerating With Flutter™](https://tech.ebayinc.com/product/ebay-motors-accelerating-with-fluttertm/).

**NoCode programming - Doing more with less code - Interview with Alex Moldovan**  
https://survivejs.com/blog/nocode-interview/  
What if you could create programs without coding? If you've ever used something like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets, you've already done this at one level. NoCode programming is an emerging topic. To learn more about it, I am interviewing Alex Moldovan.

**浅析鸿蒙 JavaScript GUI 技术栈**  
https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/240594356  
众所周知，刚刚开源的「鸿蒙 2.0」以 JavaScript 作为 IoT 应用开发的框架语言。这标志着继 SpaceX 上天之后，JavaScript 再一次蹭到了新闻联播级的热点。这么好的机会，只拿来阴阳怪气实在太可惜了。作为科普，这篇文章不会拿着放大镜找出代码中的槽点来吹毛求疵，而是希望通俗地讲清楚它所支持的 GUI 到底是怎么一回事。只要对计算机基础有个大概的了解，应该就不会对本文有阅读上的障碍。

**智能UI：面向未来的UI开发技术**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/qIA0egAU5AX60IX1yX3HyA  
今天，耳放技术可以推xx欧姆的高级耳机，把手机从音频播放的听个响、打电话等基本需求中释放出来，放大至“唯美的音乐”、“震撼的视频临场感”……那么，前端技术应该如何把UI和交互从“功能”中释放出来，放大至更广阔的领域呢？接下来谈谈我的一些愚见。

**Why I Love React**  
https://epicreact.dev/why-i-love-react/  
Betting on React was a big leap for me. I loved Angular.js and I built some awesome applications, libraries, and tools with it. But I'm so glad that I gave React some of my time because it's paid me back in productivity and velocity that I didn't even realize was possible before. If you'd like that in your life and you haven't jumped onboard with React, then I definitely suggest you give it a try.

**My thoughts on endless battle of React state management libraries (setState/useState vs Redux vs Mobx)**  
https://dev.to/mpodlasin/my-thoughts-on-endless-battle-of-react-state-management-libraries-setstate-usestate-vs-redux-vs-mobx-2kal  
If you want to dabble into time traveling debugging or you need to store your serializable state in one place (for example to save it on the backend or in local storage), then Redux is for you. If your applications state is highly interconnected and you want to make sure that updates of one property will result in immediate updates of other properties, than Mobx model will fit that problem very well. And if you don't have any specific requirements, just start with vanilla React.

**GOTO 2020 • You Really Don't Need All That JavaScript, I Promise**  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1L2WgXu2JY  
JavaScript is your behavior layer; the way to add interactivity to your sites, to provide a slick and delightful user experience, to make everything fast and easy and clean. But at some point everything changed: the tail started to wag the dog instead and development became JavaScript-first. We'll talk about how you maybe shouldn't rely on JS as much as you're told to, and some practical strategies for how to build sites without reaching for a JS framework as first, last, and only tool for making the web.

**AVIF has landed**  
https://jakearchibald.com/2020/avif-has-landed/  
AVIF is a new image format derived from the keyframes of AV1 video. It's a royalty-free format, and it's already supported in Chrome 85 on desktop. Android support will be added soon, Firefox is working on an implementation, and although it took Safari 10 years to add WebP support, I don't think we'll see the same delay here, as Apple are a member of the group that created AV1.

**Beyond Media Queries: Using Newer HTML & CSS Features for Responsive Designs**  
https://css-tricks.com/beyond-media-queries-using-newer-html-css-features-for-responsive-designs/  
Beyond using media queries and modern CSS layouts, like flexbox and grid, to create responsive websites, there are certain overlooked things we can do well to make responsive sites. In this article, we’ll dig into a number tools (revolving around HTML and CSS) we have at the ready, from responsive images to relatively new CSS functions that work naturally whether we use media queries or not. In fact, media queries become more of a complement when used with these features rather than the full approach. Let’s see how that works. Releated: [Designing With Reduced Motion For Motion Sensitivities](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/09/design-reduced-motion-sensitivities/), [Working with JavaScript Media Queries

**The Great Irony of Serverless Computing**  
https://blog.sentry.io/2020/09/09/the-great-irony-of-serverless-computing  
Working with Serverless computing is like riding an electric bike. You get speed, flexibility, automatic assistance to scale with ease. Development is usually hassle-free because you can focus on code and only pay for usage of the service. Except when your users hit an error. Debugging that issue feels like your bike’s battery just died while climbing a steep hill.

**How do Routers Work, Really?**  
https://kamila.is/teaching/how-routers-work/

At the end of this exposition, I will give you the complete source code to a functional router (written in P4, the new & shiny software-defined networking thing). My aim is that you will understand every line of that.

**How to speed up the Rust compiler one last time**  
https://blog.mozilla.org/nnethercote/2020/09/08/how-to-speed-up-the-rust-compiler-one-last-time/

More and more text-based content is shared over the Internet, but not everything is thoroughly read. In fact, by the time this article reaches the next screen, a significant share of you will have already stopped reading. Studies suggest that on medium, a popular platform for long blog posts, the average read-through rate is around 40 %—that means only two out of five readers that start reading an article, will actually stick around to finish it (though some argue that there is still significant variance). Readymag Stories project read-through data revolves around the same numbers—by the end of each story, we lose over half of those who began interested.

**Technology Is Compounding Inequality and It's Okay**  
https://www.bryanlee.net/blog/technology-is-compounding-inequality-and-its-okay  
William Gibson once said, "The future is already here – it's just not evenly distributed." I wholeheartedly agree. Therein lies the problem - the future is never evenly distributed. We believe technology to be ubiquitous only because we live in a first-world country. Technologies can take years, decades, and centuries to spread evenly. Come to think of it; I'm not sure there is any technology that has been truly distributed to every person on Earth. Even the most basic technologies many of us take for granted, like electricity, literacy, and clean water, are far from evenly distributed.
