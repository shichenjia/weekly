**Data Mesh Principles and Logical Architecture**  
https://martinfowler.com/articles/data-mesh-principles.html  
Data mesh addresses these dimensions, founded in four principles: domain-oriented decentralized data ownership and architecture, data as a product, self-serve data infrastructure as a platform, and federated computational governance. Each principle drives a new logical view of the technical architecture and organizational structure.

**The React Hooks Announcement In Retrospect: 2 Years Later**  
https://dev.to/ryansolid/the-react-hooks-announcement-in-retrospect-2-years-later-18lm  
This post represents my perspective of events and could depict an imagined narrative. I'm reflecting as I believe the Hooks announcement to be the most important turning point in front end development in the past 5 years. And that its impact is still being felt today and will continue for years to come. I'll leave you to be the judge.

**Flying the Nest: WebThings Gateway 1.0**  
https://hacks.mozilla.org/2020/12/flying-the-nest-webthings-gateway-1-0/  
This blog post will explain what to expect from the 1.0 release, the action you need to take if you want to transition your existing WebThings Gateway to new community-run infrastructure, and what to expect from the WebThings project going forward.

**What do I care the open web is dying?**  
https://insightbrowser.com/blog/open-web-dying-why-care  
My goal here is to make it more palpable how everyday apps, searches and tools get worse when we let big centralized companies take over the web, and explore some paths for reversing it.

**WMR: A Tiny All-in-One Development Tool for Modern Web Apps**  
https://github.com/preactjs/wmr

**Here’s what people in tech had to say about JavaScript when it debuted in 1995**  
https://superhighway.dev/javascript-25-years-1995  
Time and time again JavaScript is crowned the most popular programming language in the World. Whether you agree with that or not, one thing’s for sure: It’s come a long way since its debut back in 1995. Whilst Brendan Eich was hard at work creating the now much loved language twenty-five years ago, the O.J Simpson trial was well underway, Ross and Rachel weren’t quite on a break, yet — and Pixar's Toy Story was mere weeks away from hitting theatres. Releated: [我把世界上第一个 JS 引擎编译回了 JS](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/330586852), [Happy 25th Anniversary JavaScript](https://openjsf.org/blog/2020/12/04/happy-25th-anniversary-javascript/).

**Reading John Resig's 'Pro JavaScript Techniques' 14 Years Later**  
https://www.marklreyes.com/review-of-pro-javascript-techniques/  
But for me personally, it was worth the time to at least leaf through these pages once before I set it back on the shelf. Some comments still hold true to this day (especially PARTS 3 and 4) and that’s ultimately what drove me to come full circle with the book as JavaScript sets foot into the next decade.

**Software research is 200 years behind biology research**  
http://shape-of-code.coding-guidelines.com/2020/11/29/software-research-is-200-years-behind-biology-research/  
Evidence-based software research requires access to data, and Github has become the primary source of raw material for many (most?) researchers. Parallels are starting to emerge between today’s researchers exploring Github and biologists exploring nature centuries ago.

**Why Do We Call it a Homepage?**  
https://thehistoryoftheweb.com/why-do-we-call-it-a-homepage/  
The word homepage came into popular use in the mid to late 90’s, but it’s origin dates back to the web’s beginning.

**The Good, The Bad and the Easy?**  
https://blog.scottlogic.com/2020/11/26/the-good-the-bad-and-the-easy.html  
Everyone wants an easy life. As a software developer I often come across code bases that are challenging to work with, that I have a knee-jerk aversion to when I first begin working with the code. Often this is just the learning curve of dealing with something new which quickly subsides. Sometimes however it’s more than that, and I’m left feeling the journey didn’t have to be that hard to reach the desired goal. This presents some questions: what factors make code easy to work with? How much of the learning curve for a given code base is a necessary part of the solving the problem, how much is unhelpful obfuscation and where does all this fit in when we talk about ‘good’ code?

**SuperCell: Reaching new heights for wider connectivity**  
https://engineering.fb.com/2020/12/03/connectivity/supercell-reaching-new-heights-for-wider-connectivity/  
In many rural areas around the world, mobile is the only option for internet connectivity. But many rural communities still lack mobile internet access because the macrocell technologies that are traditionally used to deliver mobile connectivity to urban areas are simply not economically viable for remote communities in lower-middle-income countries. SuperCell is designed to be a cost-effective, reliable alternative to traditional macrocell sites and to better address the need for connectivity in rural areas.

**30 years later, QBasic is still the best**  
http://www.nicolasbize.com/blog/30-years-later-qbasic-is-still-the-best/  
We have built more robust and more complex languages/frameworks/IDEs (which are of course necessary for any real-life application), but we have never really made a simpler or more direct access to the thrill of programming than QBasic. Even running QBasic today has become dreadful to the novice that uses a modern Mac/PC/Linux machine, whereas it used to simply require inserting a 3,5” floppy in the A:\ disk drive… Enough rant, today is all about the celebration of yet another person who discovered the excitement and beauty of programming!

**Chrome to remove HTTP/2 Push**  
https://www.ctrl.blog/entry/http2-push-chromium-deprecation.html  
Chromium developers have announced that they plan to remove support for HTTP/2 server push from the market-leading browser engine. Server push lets web servers preemptively send clients resources it expects them to request later. The technique can reduce the number of network round-trips required before the client has all the resources it needs to display a page. The announcement cited high implementation complexity, low adoption among websites, and questionable performance gains as the reason for the removal.
