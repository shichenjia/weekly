**Unit Testing is Overrated**  
https://tyrrrz.me/blog/unit-testing-is-overrated  
Unit testing is a popular approach for testing software, but mostly for the wrong reasons. It’s often touted as an effective way for developers to test their code while also enforcing best design practices, however many find it encumbering and superficial. It’s important to understand that development testing does not equate to unit testing. The primary goal is not to write tests which are as isolated as possible, but rather to gain confidence that the code works according to its functional requirements. And there are better ways to achieve that. Writing high-level tests that are driven by user behavior will provide you with much higher return on investment in the long run, and it isn’t as hard as it seems. Find an approach that makes the most sense for your project and stick to it.

**Always bet on HTML – being misunderstood**  
https://christianheilmann.com/2020/07/06/always-bet-on-html-being-misunderstood/  
That said, to me the argument of HTML vs. JavaScript is boring and we’ve spent years running in circles around it. The job we have now is to battle some of the old prejudices against HTML with facts and good examples. Not by telling people off for relying on JavaScript. Often the best way is to ask why they chose to do that. If there is a lack of education or HTML knowledge, we can follow up with good resources. I’m pretty sure the image of the “I don’t care about end users, the only thing I care about is developer convenience” code-Bro isn’t as common as we think it is.

**对低代码、零代码产品的一些看法**  
https://www.yuque.com/xufei-coder/code/plepri  
我们可以发现，不管哪种形态，都只是相同底层约束之上，面向不同使用群体的一种产品抽象而已。它们从不矛盾，而是互补的。甚至也可以从另外一个角度看待，提供一种从轻度差异化到重度差异化定制的产品升级路线，使得每个层面的客户都可以得到适合自己层次的需求定制度。

**No More Random Acts of Bot-Building**  
https://uxmag.com/articles/no-more-random-acts-of-bot-building  
The race toward hyper-automation is marked by pitfalls and staggering opportunities. Hyper-automated companies are not only accomplishing more with less effort, it’s also easier for them to further automate new and more sophisticated processes and tasks. So in the short term, the payoff is that your organization gets to remain competitive. The long term-dividends, it would seem, have the potential to compound exponentially. 

**Just Too Efficient**  
https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2020/07/05/Too-Efficient  
Bruce is pointing out that overoptimizing efficiency doesn’t just burn people out, it also too often requires cutting into what you later realize were prudent safety margins. It’s hard to think of a position more radical than being “against efficiency”. And I’m not. Efficiency is a good, and like most good things, has to be bought somehow, and paid for. There is a point where the price is too high, and we’ve passed it.

**Testing Firefox more efficiently with machine learning**  
https://hacks.mozilla.org/2020/07/testing-firefox-more-efficiently-with-machine-learning/  
A browser is an incredibly complex piece of software. With such enormous complexity, the only way to maintain a rapid pace of development is through an extensive CI system that can give developers confidence that their changes won’t introduce bugs. Given the scale of our CI, we’re always looking for ways to reduce load while maintaining a high standard of product quality. We wondered if we could use machine learning to reach a higher degree of efficiency.

**Google AMP in 2020 - better, but still not good**  
https://areknawo.com/google-amp-in-2020-better-but-still-not-good/  
AMP is a pretty interesting idea with some great goals in mind for making the Web a better place. However, it's the execution that complicates everything so badly. Sure, if you're running a big news outlet, or say an unmonetized blog or one monetized with big, well-known ad networks (e.g. Google AdSense), then AMP might be a good choice for you. But not really because of its speed (unless you don't have time to properly optimize your website that is), but rather because of all the Google perks that you get with it.

**Moving from TypeScript to Rust / WebAssembly**  
https://nicolodavis.com/blog/typescript-to-rust/  
I recently decided to switch the engine of Boardgame Lab from TypeScript to Rust. The application itself is an SPA written in Svelte. I only switched the logic that updates the game state to Rust. Here is a summary of my experience with the transition.

**技术选型：没有谷歌的命，得了谷歌的病**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/IM9B_AJRYrwgk4imlEO_TQ  
谷歌也曾从小鱼慢慢发展为庞然大物。如果没有强大的开发军团，就做不了在全球部署的产品。公司规模的不同，决定了技术决策的不同。我的大部分职业生涯是在小公司度过的。我之前是初创公司 Housekeep 的 CTO，这家公司给了我 6 年宝贵的经验，我将在这篇文章里逐一分享。这些策略虽然有些反直觉，但它们最终让 Housekeep 走到了现在的位置，已经提供了超过 260 万个小时的清洁服务。如果你想要成为下一个谷歌，请记住以下 8 个策略。

**Comparing state machines: XState vs. Robot**  
https://blog.logrocket.com/comparing-state-machines-xstate-vs-robot/  
State machines offer a much better-organized way to manage state in React applications and they’re easy to scale compared to other alternatives. XState and Robot are two very popular libraries that, while very similar, approach handling machines from very different points of view.

**Building Twitter’s ad platform architecture for the future**  
https://blog.twitter.com/engineering/en_us/topics/infrastructure/2020/building-twitters-ad-platform-architecture-for-the-future.html

**Private matching for compute: New solutions to the problem of enabling compute on private set intersections**  
https://engineering.fb.com/open-source/private-matching/  
Private-ID performs an outer join between two databases. It does not reveal any information about the records except for the size of the intersection (how many records overlap). We use elliptic curve cryptography to ensure the privacy of records as we exchange data between two parties. PS3I performs an inner join between two databases and outputs matching records that are encrypted as additive shares. We use elliptic curve cryptography along with Paillier encryption to generate encrypted records that are entered into a multiparty computation framework.

**Why you should build your next app with a GraphQL database**  
https://dgraph.io/blog/post/graphdb-for-your-next-app/  
In this post, I'm going to pick apart why you should trust a graph database for your next app and not trust a relational database. Too often, such discussion is posed from the viewpoint of why move off a relational platform; why do something other than the default choice? I'm going to turn that around, arguing instead that, for most apps, a graph database should be the default choice, and you'd need a good reason to go the other way. 另附：[Introducing and Scaling a GraphQL BFF](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/graphql-bff/), [Building Serverless GraphQL API in Node with Express and Netlify](https://css-tricks.com/building-serverless-graphql-api-in-node-with-express-and-netlify/).

**Tech & Skills required for RPA Success in 2020: In-depth Guide**  
https://research.aimultiple.com/rpa-tech/  
RPA is a trending technology that helps businesses achieve more efficient processes. According to Gartner, the RPA market grew 63% in 2018 and expected to reach from $0.8 billion to $1.3 billion in 2019.  While it is applicable to many business processes from finance to human resources, it is critical to identify the most suitable processes for automation to maximize RPA benefits. For that, businesses leverage other technologies, like process mining and data extraction, along with the necessary skills for RPA deployment like strategic planning, process understanding as well as programming skills.

**LibreOffice: the next five years**  
https://lwn.net/SubscriberLink/825598/21fb7c2a3f9358e7/  
Members of the LibreOffice community have been working on a five-year marketing plan. The intent is to create differentiated versions of LibreOffice while avoiding open-core or proprietary business models. Part of that involves getting a better handle on the LibreOffice brand. The plan starts by creating the concept of the "LibreOffice Engine", which is a term to describe the core LibreOffice code. It is meant to be a way to enable products selling under their own brand to associate themselves with LibreOffice while maintaining their own identity. "LibreOffice Engine" is described in the plan as a sort of equivalent to the highly successful "Intel Inside" branding effort. Presumably this term would be trademarked by the Document Foundation; the plan does not get into what constraints would be put on who could use the trademark (and how).

Get into the habit of removing something every time you add something.
