**The Six Hats of the API Architect**  
https://tyk.io/the-six-hats-of-the-api-architect/  
I recently posted a question on Twitter asking for questions or insights into the role of the API architect. I received some wonderful responses, including insights from API product managers, architects, and company founders. I want to summarize these findings within a framework developed by Edward de Bono called the Six Thinking Hats, then answer some common questions about API architects by applying this framework.

**The Importance of Deep Work & The 30-Hour Method for Learning a New Skill**  
https://azeria-labs.com/the-importance-of-deep-work-the-30-hour-method-for-learning-a-new-skill/  
The Law of Productivity: High-Quality Work Produced = (Time Spent) x (Intensity of Focus). The best moments usually occur when a person’s body or mind is stretched to its limits in a voluntary effort to accomplish something difficult and worthwhile. To create a state of flow, one must follow certain rules and embrace deliberate practice through a concept called deep work. 

**Building a self-updating profile README for GitHub**  
https://simonwillison.net/2020/Jul/10/self-updating-profile-readme/  
GitHub quietly released a new feature at some point in the past few days: profile READMEs. Create a repository with the same name as your GitHub account (in my case that’s github.com/simonw/simonw), add a README.md to it and GitHub will render the contents at the top of your personal profile page—for me that’s github.com/simonw.

**You've only added two lines - why did that take two days!**  
https://www.mrlacey.com/2020/07/youve-only-added-two-lines-why-did-that.html  
It might seem a reasonable question, but it makes some terrible assumptions: lines of code = effort, lines of code = value, all lines of code are equal. None of those are true.

**Everything You Have to Know About Core Web Vitals**  
https://calibreapp.com/blog/core-web-vitals  
Google has launched the Web Vitals initiative, pointing to a subset of metrics that should always be tracked. These metrics are called Core Web Vitals. While introducing new naming nomenclature might not seem like much, having consistent, clear advice on what to track and why is extremely valuable. That fact, combined with using Core Web Vitals to establish site ranking and grade user experience, makes Vitals essential. In this article, you will learn what Core Web Vitals are, why are they important and how to track them.

**How Microfrontends Can Help to Focus on Business Needs**  
https://www.infoq.com/articles/microfrontends-business-needs/  
Microfrontends can help developers to focus on functional requirements and business needs. Microfrontends can accelerate time to market, increase reuse within your company, and simplify the development process. Possible trade-offs are extra complexity, integration costs, and negative impacts on UX and performance. Building a platform for microfrontends is quite similar to building one for microservices. Mashroom Server can be the integration component for such a platform.

**Building SVG Components in React**  
https://pganalyze.com/blog/building-svg-components-in-react  
React is well known as a great tool for building complex applications from HTML and CSS, but that same approach can also be used with SVG to build sophisticated custom UI elements. In this article, we'll give a brief overview of SVG, when to use it (and when not to), and how to use it effectively in a React application. We'll also briefly touch on how to integrate with d3 (which comes in very useful when working with SVG).

**The Cicada Principle, revisited with CSS variables**  
https://lea.verou.me/2020/07/the-cicada-principle-revisited-with-css-variables/  
So what is the Cicada Principle and how does it relate to web design in a nutshell? It boils down to: when using repeating elements (tiled backgrounds, different effects on multiple elements etc), using prime numbers for the size of the repeating unit maximizes the appearance of organic randomness. Note that this only works when the parameters you set are independent.

**Things I Wish I’d Known About CSS**

**Why VS Code is so popular?**  
https://areknawo.com/why-vs-code-is-so-popular/  
If you're reading this post, I bet you know or maybe even use VS Code. This fact alone tells us a lot about the VS Code's popularity. Millions of developers around the world from many different fields of software use this editor for their daily work. But why's that? In this article, I'd like to go over some of the most important reasons behind the VS Code's popularity. We all know that the general answer is "because it's good", but I'd like to go deeper than that. To explore what makes a really good code editor and how it's done!

**How we ensure credible analytics on Dropbox mobile apps**  
https://dropbox.tech/mobile/how-we-ensure-credible-analytics-on-dropbox-mobile-apps  
We perform biweekly releases for our Mobile apps at Dropbox, so getting the data right on the first go is crucial. If we make a mistake in logging the data, we have to wait for two weeks to fix it. By engaging early and often with our product and analyst counterparts, we can more fully understand the value of our analytics. By knowing the questions we are trying to answer we can more meaningfully and thoughtfully add analytics code to our codebases. Lastly, by snapshot testing the events and fields for our analytics we can ensure the accuracy of our data.

**The Emerging Landscape of Edge-Computing**  
https://mikhail.io/2020/07/emerging-landscape-of-edge-computing/  
The Emerging Landscape of Edge-Computing presents several use cases for today’s edge deployments. These applications are not end-user interactive mobile applications opportunistically using the edge as originally envisioned. Instead, they are geographically constrained, mission-critical, industrial or enterprise applications. They rely primarily on edge computing and opportunistically use the cloud. Across these scenarios, network bandwidth and reliability drive the use of edge computing, especially given the high volume of generated data, limited and intermittent connectivity to the cloud.

**Empowering the Visual Effects Community with the NetFX Platform**  
https://netflixtechblog.com/empowering-the-visual-effects-community-with-the-netfx-platform-35fdf604909c

In line with that, we’re excited to announce NetFX, a cloud-based platform that will make it easier for vendors, artists and creators to connect and collaborate on visual effects (VFX) for our titles.

**Documentation as knowledge capture**  
http://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=8741  
In that earlier essay I used the term “knowledge capture” in passing. This is a term of art from AI; it refers to the process of extracting domain knowledge from the heads of human experts into a form that can be expressed as an algorithm executable by the literalistic logic of a computer.

**Etcd, or, why modern software makes me sad**  
https://www.roguelazer.com/2020/07/etcd-or-why-modern-software-makes-me-sad/  
Popular modern technology is taken over by expats from a megacorp and made worse in the service of a hyper-specialized (and just plain over-hyped) orchestration platform. That's the world today. Anything that has a simple and elegant feature-set ends up coöpted by people who just want to build big ungainly architecture and ends up inheriting features from whatever megacorp the coöpters came from9. The software development world would prefer to use their multi-gigabyte IDEs running on ElectronJS to build thousand-dependency Java applications targeting ungainly APIs on hard-to-operate systems than support something simpler and better. Quality is, alas, a dying art.

**Tech Sector Job Interviews Assess Anxiety, Not Software Skills**  
https://news.ncsu.edu/2020/07/tech-job-interviews-anxiety/  
A new study from North Carolina State University and Microsoft finds that the technical interviews currently used in hiring for many software engineering positions test whether a job candidate has performance anxiety rather than whether the candidate is competent at coding. The interviews may also be used to exclude groups or favor specific job candidates. Our study suggests that a lot of well-qualified job candidates are being eliminated because they’re not used to working on a whiteboard in front of an audience.

**Are Sliders Better than Numbered Scales**  
https://measuringu.com/numbers-versus-sliders/  
When collecting data in studies of user experience, it can be tempting to use sliders in place of more standard linear numeric scales. It just feels like they should provide a better indication of the feelings and attitudes of the people providing the ratings (there is a cool factor to them!). However, findings from the literature and our recent study indicate that sliders do not provide any particular measurement advantage over the more widely used linear numeric scales, especially if the linear numeric scale has at least five response options.

文本可视化应用在多个领域，包括网络的舆论趋势、淘宝卖家对用户评论的分析和舆论对股票基金的影响等。在此之前傅四维老师先为我们简单介绍了一下什么是文本，包含书本、新闻、网页和论坛等，还介绍了文本可视化的两个主要大类：内容分析(content)和话题分析(topic)。对于文本的分析可从词法、语法和语义三个层次进行分析。并提出了如图1所示的文本可视化的处理过程：包括预处理（去除停用词等）、特征提取(feature)、相似度计算(measurement)、可视化设计和布局以及可交互式设计。

**德鲁克，为何终身不谈“如何管理下属”？**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/yZsT7eMq5I5lZCykO4hb7Q  
德鲁克认为，最有效的方式是鼓励员工围绕上一级目标，主动承担设立自身目标的责任（而不仅仅是有参与的感觉），并提供充分的信息以便其自行掌控工作的进展。这时候作为上司的角色只有一个，就是要发挥协助的作用，他甚至将之成为管理哲学。依靠目标和自我控制进行管理，促使公共利益成为每个管理者的目标，以更严格更高的要求、更有效的内在控制，来取代外在控制，激励管理者采取行动；不是别人命令或催促他做什么，而是客观的任务使然。如果说在工业时代这个理念有些超前的话，在今天，依靠目标和自我控制进行管理，已经成为对管理者最务实的建议。知识和创意工作的性质、加速变化的环境，都使得控制式管理失效。德鲁克的管理理念也许可以用六个字来概括：人为重，事为先。

-- THE END --
