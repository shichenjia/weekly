2020.10.19 - The Developer Experience Gap  
========  

## 本期看点

**The Developer Experience Gap**  
https://redmonk.com/sogrady/2020/10/06/developer-experience-gap/  
If there is and can be no Apple-equivalent enterprise vendor arriving to make sure the enterprise telephone app team plays nicely with the enterprise music player team, what progress can be expected? It’s early, and the next few quarters should provide hints at who has accurately identified the depth of the problem and taken steps to address it. In the meantime, here are five adjectives that will describe the next generation of developer experience: Comprehensive, Developer Native, Elegant, Multi-Runtime, Multi-Vendor.

**Faster Web App Delivery with PRPL**  
https://addyosmani.com/blog/the-prpl-pattern/  
PRPL is a pattern for structuring and serving web applications and Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) with an emphasis on improved app delivery and launch performance. The letters describe a set of ordered steps for fast, reliable, efficient loading.

**Webpack 5 release**  
https://webpack.js.org/blog/2020-10-10-webpack-5-release/  
The major version was also the chance to revise some of the defaults and to align with proposals and specifications that come up in the meantime. Relaeted: [Webpack 5 Headache](https://blog.sindresorhus.com/webpack-5-headache-b6ac24973bf1), [How to Set Up webpack 5 from Scratch](https://www.taniarascia.com/how-to-use-webpack/).

**Temporal: Open Source Workflows as Code**  
https://mikhail.io/2020/10/temporal-open-source-workflows-as-code/  
https://www.temporal.io/  
Microservices, serverless functions, cloud-native applications—distributed event-driven business applications are hot, and we will deal with them for years. I worry that the application development industry underestimates the complexity of such systems. Ad-hoc solutions to common problems may rapidly increase the technical debt and slow down the ability to innovate. I’m excited to see tools like Temporal enter the space of open-source workflows, or rather the space of asynchronous data processing. Releated: [Why the Serverless Revolution Has Stalled](https://www.infoq.com/articles/serverless-stalled/), [Serverless Horror Stories](https://thenewstack.io/serverless-horror-stories/).

**Emerging Architectures for Modern Data Infrastructure**  
https://a16z.com/2020/10/15/the-emerging-architectures-for-modern-data-infrastructure/  
And yet, despite all of this energy and momentum, we’ve found that there is still a tremendous amount of confusion around what technologies are on the leading end of this trend and how they are used in practice. In the last two years, we talked to hundreds of founders, corporate data leaders, and other experts – including interviewing 20+ practitioners on their current data stacks – in an attempt to codify emerging best practices and draw up a common vocabulary around data infrastructure. This post will begin to share the results of that work and showcase technologists pushing the industry forward.

**Thoughts writing a Google App script**  
https://martinfowler.com/articles/202009-google-app-dir.html  
Recently a friend of mine asked for a simple program that would correlate some data drawn from a couple of online services. I decided the best way to do this for him would be to use a google spreadsheet as the host, putting the code into the spreadsheet's script area. I'm no expert in Google App Script, but the exercise led to a few observations, which I feel compelled to share.

**Svelte for Sites, React for Apps**  
https://www.swyx.io/svelte-sites-react-apps/  
Why we should stop trying to use the same tool for different jobs. In 2020, my personal recommendation to web developers is to use Svelte for Sites, and React for Apps. This is, remarkably, a nuanced enough opinion that it pisses off fans of either of them.

**编码技巧（五）：适当可扩展**  
https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/266076082  
本文介绍了一个新的编码技巧：“适当可扩展”，什么样的代码才能成为 “适当” 的呢？文中详细的进行了解释。值得一提，代码的各种优秀特征，都是需要花费精力来写出来的，也就说需要成本，我们才能有收益。所以，提供 “可扩展性”，必然得是满足了相关的需求，不能是开发者一厢情愿而为之。当然为了追求技术精进，高度可扩展的案例，也是非常值得学习的。
这并不冲突。我们可以身怀绝技，但用的时候却只 “恰到好处”。这才是行家的手笔呀。

**聊聊前端 UI 组件：组件体系**  
https://ourai.ws/posts/the-system-of-frontend-ui-components/  
在本系列的上篇文章《聊聊前端 UI 组件：组件特征》中，通过从关注点分离的角度进行前端 UI 组件的构成分析，并以较为抽象的视角对 UI 组件分门别类，以及描述了让组件间可以表现复用的继承关系，从而建立出前端 UI 组件的特征模型。本文将以上篇文章中所得出的特征模型为基础，探讨下如何设计并建立一个前端 UI 组件体系。在做组件体系设计的时候，最重要的一点就是——要真真正正地想着把 UI 组件弄成可复用的，就像制造业生产时所用的物料一样——构造可交换的 UI 组件。

**前端模块化的十年征程**  
https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/265632724  
十年征程，前端模块化终于从呱呱坠地到长大成人。自动构建工具的新趋势：bundleless，把开发中拖慢速度的打包工作给去掉，从而获得更快的开发速度。代表性工具是vite和snowpack。

**如何提升职业工作效率**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/zH9kFjJQ5zE9mKGEiwEYAA

**Cumulative Layout Shift in Practice**  
https://nicj.net/cumulative-layout-shift-in-practice/  
Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) is a user experience metric that measures how unstable content is for your visitors. Layout shifts occur when page content moves after being presented to the user. These unexpected shifts can lead to a frustrating visual and user experience, such as misplaced clicks or rendered content being scrolled out of view.

**Supercharge Testing React Applications With Wallaby.js**

**World smallest office suite**  
https://zserge.com/posts/awfice/  
We are all familiar with a traditional office suite - a word processor, a spreadsheet, a presentation program, maybe a diagramming or note-taking app. We have seen it all in Microsoft Office and Google Docs. Those are really powerful and large. But what would be the most minimal amount of code required to build an office suite?

**Please stop using CDNs for external Javascript libraries**  
https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2020/10/please-stop-using-cdns-for-external-javascript-libraries/  
Lots of websites use large Javascript libraries. They often include them by using a 3rd party Content Delivery Network. I think these advantages are overstated and lead to some significant disadvantages.

**Rust after the honeymoon**  
http://dtrace.org/blogs/bmc/2020/10/11/rust-after-the-honeymoon/  
All of this is not to say that Rust is perfect; there are certainly some minor annoyances (rustfmt: looking at you!), and some forthcoming features that I eagerly await (e.g., safe transmutes, const generics). And in case it needs to be said: just because Rust makes it easier to write robust software doesn’t mean that it makes it impossible to write shoddy software! Releated: [Blades: A 'Blazing Fast' Simple Static Site Generator Built with Rust](https://www.getblades.org/), [Rust meets the web - a clash of programming paradigms](https://www.jakobmeier.ch/blogging/Rust_on_the_Web.html).

**How AI is powering a more helpful Google**  
https://blog.google/products/search/search-on/  
When I first came across the web as a computer scientist in the mid-90s, I was struck by the sheer volume of information online, in contrast with how hard it was to find what you were looking for. We’ve made tremendous progress over the past 22 years, making Google Search work better for you every day. With recent advancements in AI, we’re making bigger leaps forward in improvements to Google than we’ve seen over the last decade, so it’s even easier for you to find just what you’re looking for. Today during our Search On livestream, we shared how we're bringing the most advanced AI into our products to further our mission to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful.

**The future of community: a future for communities**  
https://thesephist.com/posts/community-possibility/  
For the last year or so, but especially since this summer, I’ve found myself almost consumed by thinking about communities – how the best ones are created, and how they can scale. But I also started to realize the possibility space for interesting communities to have an impact on the world is much larger than I expected. Conversely, I think most of the money and effort being directed toward improving the status quo of community building is misdirected by a myopic view of where that impact will be, and what problems we need to solve together for that impact to be fully realized.

**企业文化建设需要适度“用力过猛”**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/fTqMP7vbunhWyDOleyYgvw  
企业文化建设，是一个有破有立的过程，破在固有的思想观念和行为模式，立在新的思想观念和行为标准。按照惯性定律，没有外力作用时，事物总是处于匀速运动或静止状态，因此成功的企业文化建设，多少会给人一种“用力过猛”的感觉，否则不足以打破当下的惯性；即便是自我心灵觉醒，同样也需要外力。海尔砸冰箱，就是一种适度“用力过猛”的外力，张瑞敏砸的不是冰箱，砸的是当时干部员工队伍中落后的思想观念，不光在企业内部，甚至在整个企业界唤醒了人们沉睡的质量意识。适度“用力过猛”，为的是让人从习以为常的稳态中惊醒，迈向需要做功的激活态（非稳态）。
