**浅谈低代码平台涉及的一些技术选型**  
https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/182211043  
作为一篇概要性的论述，本文只是简单提及了低代码平台开发过程中的一些主要方面的技术选型，细节内容是非常庞杂的，足够写几十篇来详细阐述，此处空间太小，不一一展开。总的原则，还是要以可组合性、配置化为最高出发点，在此基础上首先构建出可运行的技术框架，然后再做上层的产品包装。后记：上次被兔子同学说，我的技术观点和选型方式一贯比较奇怪，比如说：倾向于模板而不是 JSX, 认为视图层的类型重要性不高。主要原因是我的视角站在低代码平台这种产品形态上，考虑的一种前提是要让元数据表达的类型成为整个应用的主题，侧重于各种编排能力，因此写这么一篇简单提一下一些粗略的思考点。

**Changing World, Changing Mozilla**  
https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2020/08/11/changing-world-changing-mozilla/  
https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24120336  
https://www.netkow.com/farewell-phonegap/  
This is a time of change for the internet and for Mozilla. From combatting a lethal virus and battling systemic racism to protecting individual privacy — one thing is clear: an open and accessible internet is essential to the fight.

**Flume - Extract business logic into JSON graphs**  
https://flume.dev/  
Build apps that are resilient to changing requirements by modeling your business logic as a JSON graph. Flume provides a sleek UI for creating and editing these graphs. Flume provides a blazing fast engine for running your logic in a browser, on your server, or in any Javascript environment. Not using a node server? Your logic graphs can also be used in any environment that supports JSON.

**Figma to Code**  
https://github.com/bernaferrari/FigmaToCode  
Most design to code plugins are bad, some are even paid. This project aims to raise the bar by generating responsive layouts in Tailwind, Flutter and SwiftUI. The plan is to eventually add support for Jetpack Compose and possibly standard HTML or other frameworks like React Native, Bootstrap or Fluent. Feedback, ideas and partnerships are appreciated!

**The End of PhoneGap**  
https://blog.phonegap.com/update-for-customers-using-phonegap-and-phonegap-build-cc701c77502c  
In the context of these developments and declining PhoneGap usage, Adobe is focusing on providing a platform that enables developers to build, extend, customize and integrate with Adobe products. Today, we are announcing the end of development for PhoneGap and PhoneGap Build and the end of our investment in Apache Cordova. The PhoneGap Build service will be discontinued on October 1, 2020.

**AI Will Change the World. Who Will Change AI? We Will.**  
https://bair.berkeley.edu/blog/2020/08/16/ai4all/  
AI4ALL is a nonprofit dedicated to increasing diversity and inclusion in AI education, research, development, and policy. The idea for AI4ALL began in early 2015 with Prof. Olga Russakovsky, then a Stanford University Ph.D. student, AI researcher Prof. Fei-Fei Li, and Rick Sommer – Executive Director of Stanford Pre-Collegiate Studies. They founded SAILORS as a summer outreach program for high school girls to learn about human-centered AI, which later became AI4ALL. In 2016, Prof. Anca Dragan started the Berkeley/BAIR AI4ALL camp, geared towards high school students from underserved communities.

**React v17.0 Release Candidate: No New Features**  
https://reactjs.org/blog/2020/08/10/react-v17-rc.html   
The React 17 release is unusual because it doesn’t add any new developer-facing features. Instead, this release is primarily focused on making it easier to upgrade React itself. We’re actively working on the new React features, but they’re not a part of this release. The React 17 release is a key part of our strategy to roll them out without leaving anyone behind. In particular, React 17 is a “stepping stone” release that makes it safer to embed a tree managed by one version of React inside a tree managed by a different version of React. Additonal: [React 17 - going BIG where it matters](https://areknawo.com/react-17-going-big-where-it-matters/), [React17新特性：启发式更新算法](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/182411298 ).

**Introducing Rome: Unifying The Frontend Development Toolchain**  
https://romefrontend.dev/blog/2020/08/08/introducing-rome.html  
Rome is not only linter, but also a compiler, bundler, test runner, and more, for JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, JSON, Markdown, and CSS. We aim to unify the entire frontend development toolchain. Rome is a monolithic tool containing functionality that has traditionally been separate tools in the frontend ecosystem. We call this a toolchain. It is not a collection of existing tools, but completely custom, built largely from scratch, contained entirely in a single package and codebase. Rome is designed to replace Babel, ESLint, Webpack, Prettier, Jest, and others.

**Build Scalable React Apps by Sharing UIs and Hooks**  
https://blog.bitsrc.io/build-scalable-react-apps-by-sharing-uis-and-hooks-fa2491e48357  
How to build scalable React apps with independent and shareable UI components and hooks.

**Top Component Libraries for React in Comparison**  
https://www.tderflinger.com/en/top-components-libs-comparison  
For every serious web application you should choose a component library. There are some very good ready-made libraries out there, so why reinvent the wheel? This article compares the top five component libraries for React by creating a simple login screen.

**Creating a QR Code step by step**  
https://www.nayuki.io/page/creating-a-qr-code-step-by-step  
This JavaScript demo application visualizes in detailed steps, how a text string is encoded into a QR Code barcode symbol. The content of this page essentially explains and justifies how my QR Code generator library works internally.

**Some more CSS comics**  
https://jvns.ca/blog/2020/08/10/some-more-css-comics/  
I’ve been continuing to write pages about CSS! Here are 6 more. Two of them are about how to think about CSS in general (“CSS isn’t easy” and “backwards compatibility”), which is something I’m still trying to wrap my head around. Additional: [CSS Mistakes While On Autopilot](https://ishadeed.com/article/css-mistakes/).

**Node.js and the struggles of being an EventTarget**  
https://www.nearform.com/blog/node-js-and-the-struggles-of-being-an-eventtarget/  
In recent years, Node.js has seen increasing adoption of standard browser application programming interfaces (APIs), such as the WHATWG-compliant URL implementation, the TextEncoder/TextDecoder API or the Console API that now matches what browsers provide. One API proving to be particularly fundamental is EventTarget, the DOM interface for firing events, and it’s worth taking a closer look at how we’re bringing EventTarget into Node.js. Doing so gives us insight into not only the process of bringing features into Node.js, but also how we deal with performance and compatibility problems, and what the future of Node.js might look like.

**How to Debug Node.js Segmentation Faults**  
https://httptoolkit.tech/blog/how-to-debug-node-segfaults  
Oh no, your JavaScript code isn't just throwing an exception or crashing: it's segfaulting. What does that mean, and how can you fix it? You'll know this happens because node will hard crash, exiting silently without any kind of real stack trace, perhaps printing just segmentation fault (core dumped). (If you do get a normal JavaScript stack trace on the other hand, then you're dealing with a normal JS error, not a segfault. Lucky you! You might be more interested in the guide on How to Debug Anything).

**A 30 Minute Chat with Allen Wirfs-Brock**

Allen is a true JavaScript expert and has a wealth of programming experience dating from the 60s as well as through working on the ECMAScript spec.

**Web History — Chapter 2: Browsers**  
https://css-tricks.com/chapter-2-browsers/  
Think about the first time you browsed the web. That first webpage. Maybe it was a rich experience, filled with images, careful design and content you couldn’t find anywhere else. Maybe it was unadorned, uninteresting, and brief. No matter what that page was, I’d be willing to bet that it had some links. And when you clicked that link, there was magic. Suddenly, a fresh page arrives on your screen. You are now surfing the web. And in that moment you understand what the web is.

**Building Reliable Mobile Applications**  
https://engineering.shopify.com/blogs/engineering/making-shopify-point-of-sale-reliable  
Reliability engineering is a well-solved problem on the server-side. Back-end teams are able to push changes to production several times a day. So, when there's an outage, they can deploy fixes right away. It is important to reduce the likelihood of bugs as much as possible and resolve issues in production as quickly as possible. In the following sections, we will detail the work we’ve done in both these areas over the last few years.

**Scaling End-to-End User Interface Tests**  
https://slack.engineering/scaling-end-to-end-user-interface-tests/  
At Slack, Quality is a shared responsibility. The Quality Engineering team is focused on creating a culture of testing, increasing test coverage, and helping the company ship high-quality features faster. We encourage all our developers to write and own end-to-end (E2E) tests. In turn, Quality Engineering (QE) is responsible for the frameworks used and provides best practices for writing reusable, scalable, and maintainable tests. In this post, we are going to walk you through our journey on how we came up with a reusable automation framework and some of the positive impact we have seen.

**Telltale: Netflix Application Monitoring Simplified**  
https://netflixtechblog.com/telltale-netflix-application-monitoring-simplified-5c08bfa780ba
Healthy Netflix services are essential to member joy. When you sit down to watch “Tiger King” you expect it to just play. Over the years we’ve learned from on-call engineers about the pain points of application monitoring: too many alerts, too many dashboards to scroll through, and too much configuration and maintenance. Our streaming teams need a monitoring system that enables them to quickly diagnose and remediate problems; seconds count! Our Node team needs a system that empowers a small group to operate a large fleet. So we built Telltale.

**Single Page Applications using Rust**  
http://www.sheshbabu.com/posts/rust-wasm-yew-single-page-application/  
Since Rust compiles to wasm, is it possible to build SPAs (Single Page Applications) purely in Rust and without writing a single line of JavaScript? The short answer is YES! Read on to learn more or visit the demo site if you can’t contain your excitement! We’ll be building a simple ecommerce site called “RustMart” that will have 2 pages: HomePage - list all the products that the customer can add to cart; ProductDetailPage - show the product details when a product card is clicked. Some people even think this approach [could make Rust the new Elm](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24122571). 另附：[Bevy: A data-driven game engine and app framework built in Rust](https://bevyengine.org/news/introducing-bevy/), [Kosmonaut: web browser from scratch in Rust](https://github.com/twilco/kosmonaut).

**Why MongoDB is ‘fundamentally better’ for developers**  
https://www.infoworld.com/article/3570729/why-mongodb-is-fundamentally-better-for-developers.html  
MongoDB co-founder and former CTO Eliot Horowitz reflects on the creation of MongoDB and his 13 years with the company. It takes a certain amount of chutzpah — OK, mountains of it — to invent a new kind of database and assume it will take over the world. Or maybe not assume, exactly, but, as MongoDB co-founder Eliot Horowitz put it in an interview, “If anyone was going to do it, we had just about the best chance of anyone out there.”.

**Why Japan's Largest Mobile Payment Company Migrated from Aurora to TiDB**  
https://pingcap.com/case-studies/japan-largest-mobile-payment-company-migrates-from-aurora-to-a-scale-out-database  
Last year, as our business grew extremely fast, our most mission-critical database, the Payment database (which manages our payment transactions), had a write-heavy workload and became a bottleneck. After a careful investigation, we decided to migrate from Amazon Aurora to TiDB, an open-source, distributed Hybrid Transactional/Analytical Processing (HTAP) database. Thanks to TiDB's horizontal scalability, we no longer have to worry about our database capacity. Below I will share why we migrated from Amazon Aurora to TiDB and the practical experience of migration.

**R and Python: The Data Science Dynamic Duo**  
https://www.datanami.com/2020/08/11/r-and-python-the-data-science-dynamic-duo/  
The language R is in the midst of a sizzling resurgence this summer. One might hypothesize that this growth is coming at the expense of Python, by far the dominant language for data science. But some evidence suggests that data scientists are increasingly using both.

**Announcing the new Jupyter Book**  
https://blog.jupyter.org/announcing-the-new-jupyter-book-cbf7aa8bc72e  
Jupyter Book is an open source project for building beautiful, publication-quality books, websites, and documents from source material that contains computational content. With this post, we’re happy to announce that Jupyter Book has been re-written from the ground up, making it easier to install, faster to use, and able to create more complex publishing content in your books. It is now supported by the [Executable Book Project](https://executablebooks.org/en/latest/), an open community that builds open source tools for interactive and executable documents in the Jupyter ecosystem and beyond.

**Extreme value theory in software engineering**  
http://shape-of-code.coding-guidelines.com/2020/08/09/extreme-value-theory-in-software-engineering/  
As its name suggests, extreme value theory deals with extreme deviations from the average, e.g., how often will rainfall be heavy enough to cause a river to overflow its banks. The initial list of statistical topics to I thought ought to be covered in my evidence-based software engineering book included extreme value theory. At the time, and even today, there were/are no books covering “Statistics for software engineering”, so I had no prior work to guide my selection of topics. I was keen to cover all the important topics, had heard of it in several (non-software) contexts and jumped to the conclusion that it must be applicable to software engineering. Years pass: the draft accumulate a wide variety of analysis techniques applied to software engineering data, but, no use of extreme value theory.

**Choreography vs Orchestration in the land of serverless**  
https://theburningmonk.com/2020/08/choreography-vs-orchestration-in-the-land-of-serverless/  
In orchestration, there is a controller (the ‘orchestrator’) that controls the interaction between services. It dictates the control flow of the business logic and is responsible for making sure that everything happens on cue. This follows the request-response paradigm. In choreography, every service works independently. There are no hard dependencies between them, and they are loosely coupled only through shared events. Each service listens for events that it’s interested in and does its own thing. This follows the event-driven paradigm. However, in this post, I want to talk about when it’s not a good idea and when you should consider the orchestration approach instead. 

**What is .NET? How does it work? Is it a language or a Platform?**  
https://www.hanselman.com/blog/WhatIsNETHowDoesItWorkIsItALanguageOrAPlatform.aspx  
If you just have a few minutes and you're learning about .NET and just want to know WTF is .NET?!? Check out my YouTube. I'll explain the whole thing is a tight 20 min, from C# to F#, NuGet, and more. I'll show code, draw on the screen, and by the end you'll have a good sense of where .NET fits into the world versus things like Java, Node, Rust, Go, and more.

**Why the C Language Will Never Stop You from Making Mistakes**  
https://thephd.github.io/your-c-compiler-and-standard-library-will-not-help-you  
Make no mistake: no matter what programmers tell you or what people whisper in your ear, the behavior of C’s governing body is very clear. We will not introduce warnings into your old code, even if that old code could be doing something dangerous. We will not steer you away from mistakes, because that could shake the veneer that what your old code does is, in fact, wrong. We will not make it easier for new programmers to write better C code. We will not demand that your old code is held to any Standard. Every new feature we add we will make optional, because we cannot possibly imagine holding compiler writers to a higher standard nor expect more out of our Standard Library vendors.

**Never Use A Dependency That You Could Replace with An Afternoon of Programming?**  
https://blog.carlmjohnson.net/post/2020/avoid-dependencies/  
I have a simple rule: never use a dependency that you could replace with an afternoon of programming. No dependency is so self-explanatory that you will be able to get it working with less than a few hours of: Searching online to see what solutions to the problem exist, Reading the docs to make sure it actually works for your problem...

**Why Write ADRs**  
https://github.blog/2020-08-13-why-write-adrs/  
Architecture decision records, also known as ADRs, are a great way to document how and why a decision was reached within a codebase. We’ve started to adopt them within the mobile team here at GitHub, documenting decisions that affect the iOS codebase and Android codebase, as well as decisions that affect both mobile clients.

https://www.androidpolice.com/2020/08/13/google-resumes-its-senseless-attack-on-the-url-bar-hides-full-addresses-on-chrome-canary/  
Google has tried on and off for years to hide full URLs in Chrome's address bar, because apparently long web addresses are scary and evil. Despite the public backlash that came after every previous attempt, Google is pressing on with new plans to hide all parts of web addresses except the domain name in Chrome 86, this time accompanied by a hover animation.

**content-visibility: the new CSS property that boosts your rendering performance**  
https://web.dev/content-visibility/  
The content-visibility property, launching in Chromium 85, might be one of the most impactful new CSS properties for improving page load performance. content-visibility enables the user agent to skip an element's rendering work, including layout and painting, until it is needed. Because rendering is skipped, if a large portion of your content is off-screen, leveraging the content-visibility property makes the initial user load much faster. It also allows for faster interactions with the on-screen content.

**ESLint v7.7.0 released**  
https://eslint.org/blog/2020/08/eslint-v7.7.0-released  
In ESLint v7.3.0, we released a change to the comma-dangle rule that disallowed having multiple options in the rule's configuration. Our semantic versioning policy allows for changes that may introduce new errors in semver-minor releases if the change is considered a bug fix and, at the time, we decided that this change fell under that category. After discussing internally whether this was the correct application of our policy or not, we have decided to update our semantic versioning policy to include rule schemas as part of the public API and to revert this change in this release.

**程序员如何把控自己的职业**  
https://coolshell.cn/articles/20977.html  
在整个成长过程中，其实有很多东西是相通的，其本上来说，就是下面的三件事：第一，如果想要把控技术，应对这个世界的一些变化，需要大致知道这个世界的一些规律和发展趋势，另外还得认识自己，自己到底适合做什么？在这个趋势和规律下属于自己的发挥领域到底是什么？这是我们每个人都需要了解的；第二，打牢基础，以不变应万变，不管世界怎样变化，我都能很快适应它。基础的重要程度对于你能够飞多高是相当有影响的，懂原理的人比不懂原理的人能做出来的事情或是能解决的问题完全是两个层级的；第三，提升成长的效率，因为现在社会的节奏实在太快了，比二十年前快得太多，技术层出不穷，所以我们的成长也要更有效率。

**腾讯的组织能力是什么**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/g42URfjH5tLhxC0EU4znkg  
有很多文章介绍阿里、华为、字节跳动的组织能力，但鲜有介绍腾讯，这可能和鹅厂低调务实的风格有关，喜欢做，不喜欢说。因专注在组织能力咨询，浸泡鹅厂5年的我，经常思考「腾讯的组织能力是什么」。在「腾讯咨询」的身份也让我有相对抽离的位置，去观察腾讯和其他优秀大厂相比下的组织能力特色。在和平年代，腾讯组织的根基是「市场化生态组织」，这种组织可以最大化地发挥自上而下的创新和活力。在非常时期，腾讯组织能力的特点是主动进化，这种能力让鹅厂主动对抗「创新者的窘境」中描述的大企业的固化结构，也符合「学习型组织」的特点，从而获得长期的竞争力。
