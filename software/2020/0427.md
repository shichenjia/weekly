https://ethanmarcotte.com/wrote/gardened/  
There is no faster (pun intended) way to slow down a site than to use a bunch of JavaScript. The thing about JavaScript is you end up paying a performance tax no less than four times:  
- The cost of downloading the file on the network  
- The cost of parsing and compiling the uncompressed file once downloaded  
- The cost of executing the JavaScript  
- The memory cost

**Node.js version 14 available now**  
https://medium.com/@nodejs/node-js-version-14-available-now-8170d384567e  
We’re excited to announce that Node.js 14 was released today! The highlights in this release include improved diagnostics, an upgrade of V8, an experimental Async Local Storage API, hardening of the streams APIs, removal of the Experimental Modules warning, and the removal of some long deprecated APIs.

**Patterns for Managing Source Code Branches**  
https://martinfowler.com/articles/branching-patterns.html  
Modern source-control systems provide powerful tools that make it easy to create branches in source code. But eventually these branches have to be merged back together, and many teams spend an inordinate amount of time coping with their tangled thicket of branches. There are several patterns that can allow teams to use branching effectively, concentrating around integrating the work of multiple developers and organizing the path to production releases. The over-arching theme is that branches should be integrated frequently and efforts focused on a healthy mainline that can be deployed into production with minimal effort. 另附：[GitLab - Our ultimate guide to Git](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2020/04/20/ultimate-git-guide/).

**早早聊：如何做职业规划**  
https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/134106143  
关于职业规划，每个人都会到这样或者那样的问题，其实总结起来就几种：不知道自己能干啥、不知道自己适合干啥、不知道自己想要干啥。为了克服 35 岁的迷茫，所以我们必须做职业规划。只有通过合适的职业规划我们才能找到一条捷径，通往未来成功之路，通过职业规划可以给职场带来助燃剂。

**Deno 中文手册诞生记：18 位志愿者，5 天时间翻译完成了所有 Deno 核心 API**

**Introducing Crank.js: A New JSX-Driven Framework**  
https://crank.js.org/blog/introducing-crank  
After months of development, I’m happy to introduce Crank.js, a new framework for creating JSX-driven components with functions, promises and generators. And I know what you’re thinking: oh no, not another web framework. There are already so many of them out there and each carries a non-negligible cost in terms of learning it and building an ecosystem to surround it, so it makes sense that you would reject newcomers if only to avoid the deep sense of exhaustion which has come to be known amongst front-end developers as “JavaScript fatigue.” Therefore, this post is both an introduction to Crank as well as an apology: I’m sorry for creating yet another framework, and I hope that by explaining the circumstances which led me to do so, you will forgive me.

**Reinventing Hooks with React Easy State**  
https://blog.risingstack.com/reinventing-hooks-with-react-easy-state/  
This article defies a lot of trending patterns, like: React hooks, avoiding mutable data, traditional dependency injection, and full front-end testing.

**Code Principles Every Programmer Should Follow**

YAGNI, Law of Demeter, Single Responsibility and other useful principles for better coding.

**Things I Wished More Developers Knew About Databases**  
https://medium.com/@rakyll/things-i-wished-more-developers-knew-about-databases-2d0178464f78  
A large majority of computer systems have some state and are likely to depend on a storage system. My knowledge on databases accumulated over time, but along the way our design mistakes caused data loss and outages. In data-heavy systems, databases are at the core of system design goals and tradeoffs. Even though it is impossible to ignore how databases work, the problems that application developers foresee and experience will often be just the tip of the iceberg. In this series, I’m sharing a few insights I specifically found useful for developers who are not specialized in this domain.

**Inside a dev's mind - How do you plan a UI feature?**  
https://jkettmann.com/how-do-you-plan-a-ui-feature/  
If you followed some of my posts you will know that I love to show how I work by giving an example. So in this post, we'll have a look at a feature as you could encounter it in a real work environment. We have acceptance criteria, a design and data to render. I will explain step by step what I was looking at and what I was thinking. The process was much quicker than writing it down and I'd probably done a lot of this in my head. But here it's in a written form so you can follow along.

**We've Ruined The Web. Here's How We Fix It.**  
https://www.thisishcd.com/episodes/world-wide-waste-with-gerry-mcgovern/jeremy-keith-weve-ruined-the-web-heres-how-we-fix-it/  
An interesting hour-long chat with Jeremy Keith, a ‘philosopher of the internet’, on the imbalances found in the modern the web.  

**A Taste of WebGPU in Firefox**  
https://hacks.mozilla.org/2020/04/experimental-webgpu-in-firefox/  
We are excited to bring WebGPU support to Firefox because it will allow richer and more complex graphics applications to run portably in the Web. It will also make the web platform more accessible to teams who mostly target modern native platforms today, thanks to the use of modern concepts and first-class WASM (WebAssembly) support.

**APIs that are missing from the web**  
https://blog.logrocket.com/apis-that-are-missing-from-the-web/  
In this article, we will be taking a look at APIs missing from the web (and PWAs) as of today, that are available to native apps. Some of these APIs are currently undergoing trials at different stages on the web (mostly on Chrome and chromium-based browsers) but are non-standard, this article is focused on the standard APIs for the web as of today.

**How Netflix brings safer and faster streaming experiences to the living room on crowded networks using TLS 1.3**  
https://netflixtechblog.com/how-netflix-brings-safer-and-faster-streaming-experience-to-the-living-room-on-crowded-networks-78b8de7f758c  
From the security analysis, we are confident that TLS 1.3 improves communication security over TLS 1.2. From the field test, we are confident that TLS 1.3 provides us a better streaming experience. At the time of writing this article, the Internet is experiencing higher than usual traffic and congestion. We believe saving even small amounts of data and round trips can be meaningful and even better if it also provides a more secure and efficient streaming experience.

**OpenCore-Desktop-Guide**  
https://github.com/dortania/OpenCore-Desktop-Guide/blob/master/README.md  
OpenCore is an open-source, unconventional, first-in-class piece of software designed to intercept kernel loading to insert a highly advanced rootkit, designed to be an alternative to Clover. OpenCore aims to resolve the constraints and issues imposed by Clover by providing a more versatile and modular system which can better understand symbols and structures to make patching far more precise and effective. 

**Finding the accurate composition of Technical and Business Requirements for the perfect Product Symphony**  
https://medium.com/walmartlabs/finding-the-accurate-composition-of-technical-and-business-requirements-for-the-perfect-product-b561a085487c  
It is important for the application to heed to the business requirements. However, it is equally important that the necessary Non-functional requirements are covered when the application is rolled out in phases. The right technical composure in the implementation of the business capabilities heavily rely on the Business strategy and the real definition of the phased implementation approach. 

**Agile’s Early Evangelists Wouldn’t Mind Watching It Die**  
https://builtin.com/software-engineering-perspectives/lean-agile-methodology-software-engineering  
Agile often puts processes over people, and it’s pushing women engineers into non-technical roles. Time to move on?

**Mob Programming and the Power of Flow**  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28S4CVkYhWA  
https://mobprogramming.org/  
Mob programming (informally mobbing) is a software development approach where the whole team works on the same thing, at the same time, in the same space, and at the same computer. This is similar to pair programming where two people sit at the same computer and collaborate on the same code at the same time.

**Efficiency vs. Resilience: What COVID-19 Teaches Computing**  
https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2020/5/244316-efficiency-vs-resilience/fulltext  
Of course, fault tolerance has been part of the canon of computing-system building for decades. Jim Gray's 1998 Turing Award citation refers to his invention of transactions as a mechanism to provide crash resilience to databases. Leslie Lamport's 2013 Turing Award citation refers to his work on fault tolerance in distributed systems. Nevertheless, I believe that computer science has yet to internalize the idea that resilience, which to me include fault tolerance, security, and more, must be pushed down to the algorithmic level. Case in point is search-result ranking. Google's original ranking algorithm was PageRank, which works by counting the number and quality of links to a page to determine how important the website is. But PageRank is not resilient to manipulation, hence "search-engine optimization." Today's result-ranking algorithms are well-kept trade secrets. Indeed, adversarial machine learning, which looks at the impact of maliciously manipulated data on machine learning, is a highly active research area.

**Our data centers now work harder when the sun shines and wind blows**  
https://blog.google/inside-google/infrastructure/data-centers-work-harder-sun-shines-wind-blows  
Addressing the challenge of climate change demands a transformation in how the world produces and uses energy. Google has been carbon neutral since 2007, and 2019 marks the third year in a row that we’ve matched our energy usage with 100 percent renewable energy purchases. Now, we’re working toward 24x7 carbon-free energy everywhere we have data centers, which deliver our products to billions of people around the world. To achieve 24x7 carbon-free energy, our data centers need to work more closely with carbon-free energy sources like solar and wind.

**Moving RedisJSON to a new codebase written in Rust**  
https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/redisjson/ep8FZyS_W7E/DX6aZEbfAQAJ  
We at Redis Labs have been working for a while on some exciting improvements to RedisJSON, which we'd like to share! First of all, we migrated the codebase from C to Rust. This allows all of us to benefit from one of Rust's central feature: safe code. Memory management is now verified by the compiler, to avoid those ubiquitous security vulnerabilities you've all heard about, such as buffer overflows and remote code execution attacks. In addition, the move to Rust allows us to work on developing new features at a higher velocity than before.

**Books I recommend to my software engineering students**  
http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~azh/blog/booksformystudents.html  
Students occasionally ask me for book recommendations. Since I'm always recommending the same ones, I decided to write up this list. You'll notice that several of them are not directly about software engineering or even computer science! The students have already had plenty of exposure to the classic CS material (and will continue to in their careers), so I try to consider books that are relevant but might not be obvious. At the end of this article I list a few programming books in case that is what you are looking for (please don't yell at me for excluding SICP). The books I recommend are:
- The Design of Everyday Things  
- Predictably Irrational  
- Outliers  
- Creativity, Inc.  
- Coders at Work  
- The Mythical Man-Month

今天早上我照例打开 Hacker News 看看有什么新奇的东西。头条的标题一下子吸引了我：I'm a software engineer going blind, how should I prepare?，一个即将失明的小哥，还想继续做程序员。这个帖子大概是我 2020 年读到最温情的文字了。帖子里说明了情况，小哥两年前被诊断出患有 Usher综合症，可能导致聋哑、眼部病变至完全失明等。他提出了几个真诚的问题：询问是否还能继续做前端程序员，有没有什么更适合视障人士的工种，有什么趁手的工具和哪些公司在招聘像他这样的程序员。

**How Tech Can Build**  
https://stratechery.com/2020/how-tech-can-build/  
It was, at first glance, hard to understand how anyone could be upset at the idea that [It’s Time to Build](https://a16z.com/2020/04/18/its-time-to-build/). That’s the title of a recent essay by Marc Andreessen, and of course I agree; I expressed the same sort of frustration Andreessen opens with last month in Compaq and Coronavirus. “Action” is a different word than “build”, but, at least from my perspective, they express the same sentiment: bend the world to our will, instead of simply accepting our fate. In that light Andreessen’s article was meaningful not for the examples of what might be built, but rather for arguing for the action of building as an end goal in and of itself.
