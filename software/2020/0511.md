**Driving engineers to an arbitrary date is a value destroying mistake**  
https://iism.org/article/driving-engineers-to-an-arbitrary-date-is-a-value-destroying-mistake-49  
In this article we'll be concentrating on high value software projects and why driving engineers to create detailed estimates for these projects, and then pressuring them to complete the software according to those estimates, is a value destroying mistake.

**Rebuilding our tech stack for the new Facebook.com**

译文 https://www.yuque.com/docs/share/6aee9dd5-da3f-462b-b4bd-caec0ec6f60e  
When we thought about how we would build a new web app — one designed for today’s browsers, with the features people expect from Facebook — we realized that our existing tech stack wasn’t able to support the app-like feel and performance we needed. A complete rewrite is extremely rare, but in this case, since so much has changed on the web over the course of the past decade, we knew it was the only way we’d be able to achieve our goals for performance and sustainable future growth. Today, we’re sharing the lessons we’ve learned while rearchitecting Facebook.com, using React (a declarative JavaScript library for building user interfaces) and Relay (a GraphQL client for React).

**Introducing Web Vitals: essential metrics for a healthy site**  
https://blog.chromium.org/2020/05/introducing-web-vitals-essential-metrics.html  
译文 https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/BSlOnrmDLWhzpCWAuTOulw    
Optimizing for quality of user experience is key to the long-term success of any site on the web. Through our ongoing engagement and collaboration with millions of web developers and site owners, we’ve developed many helpful metrics and tools across Google to help business owners, marketers, and developers alike identify opportunities to improve user experiences. However, abundance of metrics and tools creates its own set of prioritization, clarity, and consistency challenges for many. Today we are introducing a new program, [Web Vitals](https://web.dev/vitals/), an initiative by Google to provide unified guidance for quality signals that, we believe, are essential to delivering a great user experience on the web. 另附：[Is it time for a Web Performance rebrand?](https://simonhearne.com/2020/web-performance-rebrand/).

**从「物种起源」到「设计进化论」- 阿里云设计语言哲思**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/IOu_IRbhXmTr_SUKyzDveA  
10万年前，语言第一次出现的时候，茹毛饮血的智人一定没有想到，地球的文明，原来从这样简单的咿咿呀呀悄然开始；5100多年前，文字就在尼罗河畔的纸草上开始若隐若现，彼时的他们也一定没有猜到，有一种东西竟然可以超越时空，将不同的咿咿呀呀记录下来，为后续持续传承的文明推开大门；也许就在几年前，我们也未曾妄想，原来“语言”还有更多元的承载方式，它可以融入任何一种形态，在产品间进行沟通与表达，完成「真实世界」和「虚拟世界」的对话。

**Write Libraries, Not Frameworks**  
https://www.brandonsmith.ninja/blog/libraries-not-frameworks  
Frameworks aren't always bad, but they are a much bigger risk - for both the creators and the users - than libraries are. If your framework can be a library without losing much, it probably should be. If you don't work at a major tech company, you probably don't have the time or energy to give a framework all of the attention it requires. Libraries aren't everything, but they should be preferred.

**Deno 1.0: What you need to know**  
https://blog.logrocket.com/deno-1-0-what-you-need-to-know/  
After almost two years, the wait is nearly over. The API has been frozen, and the countdown to Deno 1.0, officially scheduled for release on May 13, has begun. Due to its famous creator and forward-thinking vision, Deno is sure to be the most exciting and controversial JavaScript-related release in recent memory. Deno is a general-purpose JavaScript/TypeScript programming environment. It brings together many of the best open-source technologies and offers a comprehensive solution in one small executable file.

**PHP showing its maturity in release 7.4**  
https://lwn.net/SubscriberLink/818973/507f4b5e09ab9870/  
This year PHP turned 25 and, as with all things, the hope is that with age comes wisdom and maturity. Often derided as a great way to write bad (and insecure) code, PHP is hard to ignore completely when it is used in nearly eight out of ten websites. With PHP 7.4.5 released in April, it's worthwhile to take a look at modern PHP, how it has evolved to address the criticisms of the past, and what lies ahead in its future.

**6 Faux Pas of HTTP API Design**  
https://blog.readme.com/http-api-faux-pas/  
HTTP APIs are very loose by definition: there’s no standards body, no API validator and not always someone there to tell you when you may be doing something incorrect. At ReadMe we have lots of experience in building, consuming and viewing APIs created by others. I asked engineers in the ReadMe team, “What are some common issues or pitfalls you see when using APIs?” This is a definitely a non-exhaustive list, but avoiding some of these pitfalls will make your APIs more “standard,” intuitive, and easy to use. We came up with the following faux pas.

**Continuation 在 JS 中的应用**  
https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/94611888  
React 新近发布的 Hooks、Suspense、Concurrent Mode 等新功能让人眼前一亮，甚至惊叹 JS 居然有如此魔力。同时，这几个功能或多或少附带一些略显奇怪的规则，没有更深层次理解的话难以把握。其实这里面并没有什么“黑科技”，就大的趋势来讲，前端整体上还是在不断借鉴计算机其它领域的优秀实践，来帮助我们更方便地解决人机交互问题。本文着眼于支撑这些功能的一个底层编程概念 Continuation（译作“续延”），期望能够在了解它之后，大家对这几个功能有进一步的理解和掌握。当然，Continuation 在 React 之外也有很多的应用，可以一眼窥豹。

**useRequest- 蚂蚁中台标准请求 Hooks**  
https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/119074168  
[useRequest](https://hooks.umijs.org/zh-CN/hooks/async) 是一个超级强大，且生产完备的网络请求 Hooks，目前已经成为蚂蚁中台最佳实践内置网络请求方案。在蚂蚁内部中台应用，写网络请求，都推荐用 useRequest。useRequest 可能是目前社区中最强大，最接地气的请求类 Hooks 了。可以覆盖 99% 的网络请求场景，无论是读还是写，无论是普通请求还是分页请求，无论是缓存还是防抖节流，通通都能支持。只有你想不到，没有它做不到（吹牛 ~）。另附：[useWorker - A React Hook for Blocking-Free Background Tasks](https://github.com/alewin/useWorker)  

**SuperCell的中台你们学不会**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/3AnS2I8fM6pat8vNN0586w  
2018 年以来，中台概念横扫整个中国信息化行业，成为了所有企业都在追捧的超级新星。如今，你不提中台都不好意思跟人说你是做信息化的。任何一个企业不立个中台项目，感觉就是已经落伍，跟不上时代潮流了。传说中台的概念的起源于一次偶得，马云在一次出访过程中，进入了一个世外桃源之地（芬兰），获得了高人指点（SuperCell），从而悟出了“中台”这门绝世武功，带回中土，掀起了“中台风暴”。但在我对 SuperCell 的模式进行深入研究以后发现：SuperCell 的中台，大部分企业是学不会的。

**对于走专业路线还是管理路线的看法**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/mGVduRcOpO92pO7wE0tKBg  
眼界很重要，这样看问题会在高处，脚下的路会更清晰，不容易做出错误的决定。对于走专业路线还是走管理路线这件事情，我觉得大家需要跳出来，从外部好好审视下自己以及自己所处的环境。认清现实，做出合理的决定。

**How Khan Academy Successfully Handled 2.5x Traffic in a Week**  
http://engineering.khanacademy.org/posts/handling-2x-traffic-in-a-week.htm  
In this post I’ll discuss architectural aspects that play a key role in the scalability of our site. Two fundamental components of our architecture serve us particularly well here. We use Google Cloud, including AppEngine, Datastore, and Memcache, and Fastly CDN, and they were the backbone of the serverless and caching strategy that’s key to our scalability.

**Rewriting the heart of our sync engine**  
https://dropbox.tech/infrastructure/rewriting-the-heart-of-our-sync-engine  
Rewriting the sync engine was really hard, and we don’t want to blindly celebrate it, because in many environments it would have been a terrible idea. It turned out that this was an excellent idea for Dropbox but only because we were very thoughtful about how we went about this process. In particular, we’re going to share reflections on how to think about a major software rewrite and highlight the key initiatives that made this project a success, like having a very clean data model.

**Serverless Needs Standardization to Be the Future of Application Infrastructure**  
https://thenewstack.io/serverless-needs-standards-to-be-the-future-of-application-infrastructure/  
Serverless gives developers the freedom to focus on building functionality into their code, rather than managing the servers on which those functions run. This liberation from mundane yet vital operational responsibility has the potential to unlock significant innovation and business value for application developers, but the lack of standardization risks fragmenting the serverless ecosystem and creating winners and losers. With standardization comes the power of open source collaboration that has fueled innovation since the dawn of the computing era.

**What Netlify’s Infrastructure Team Learned as It Increased Deploy Speed by up to 2x**  
https://www.netlify.com/blog/2020/05/05/what-netlifys-infrastructure-team-learned-as-it-increased-deploy-speed-by-up-to-2x/  
What if you realized you could optimize the structure of an existing system by doing less work? We can probably all attest that it’s one thing to notice an opportunity, and an entirely different beast to actually roll it out into production. This is the story of how the infrastructure team at Netlify took a 4 year old codebase and isolated an issue, tested a few different solutions (with some interesting stumbling blocks along the way), and eventually improved observability while rolling it out to production. The result of this work is what we’re fondly calling “nitro deploys”, a 2x increase in the speed of our deploy mechanism.

**0X10 RULES**  
https://fabiensanglard.net/ilike/index.html  
The site started in a world before smartphones and tablets at a time where Apple products still used PowerPC processors. The hand-crafted framework to run it grew organically over the years and remarkably followed the path of most software. It became bloated and obsolete. In 2018, it was time to revise the engine. I wanted to build something rooted in simplicity, responsiveness, and speed. I opted for a drastic approach where instead of starting from my existing framework and removing/fixing features, I started from scratch and added only what I needed.

https://jestjs.io/blog/2020/05/05/jest-26  
One of the instrumental releases was Jest 15 which tied everything together and provided good defaults that allowed people to run Jest often without any setup. However, this approach has a big downside as Jest installs a lot of dependencies into your projects that you may not need. We are now beginning to address this shortcoming and are working on reducing Jest’s install size while keeping it approachable and extensible. We have made the following breaking changes in Jest 26. 另附： [Majestic - Zero config GUI for Jest](https://github.com/Raathigesh/majestic)

Inkscape uses the standardized SVG file format as its main format, which is supported by many other applications including web browsers.

**Making Emacs popular again**  
https://lwn.net/SubscriberLink/819452/1480c3a59d3d9093/  
The Emacs editor predates Linux, and was once far more popular, but it has fallen into relative obscurity over the years. In a mega-thread on the emacs-devel mailing list, participants discussed various ideas for making Emacs more "attractive", in both aesthetic and in "appealing to more users" senses of that term. Any improvements to Emacs in that regard have numerous hurdles to overcome, however. There are technical questions and, naturally, licensing considerations, but there is also the philosophical question of what it is, exactly, that stops the venerable text editor from being more popular.

**The Past Is Still Present – An Overview of Timeless Design**  
https://www.toptal.com/designers/ux/timeless-design  
Digital designers would be wise to recognize the value of creating work that maintains relevancy for years to come. Maybe instead of obsessing over the latest trends, the industry ought to applaud work that has stood the test of time. User interfaces may never hold the nostalgic charm of a rugged, old Vespa scooter, but digital products can still improve lives. The longer they do, the more likely they are to leave a legacy that lasts for decades to come.

The new iPad cursor is a product of what came before, but it’s blending, rather than layering, that makes it successful in practice. The blending of the product team’s learnings across Apple TV, Mac and iPad. The blending of touch, mouse and touchpad modalities. And, of course, the blending of a desire to make something new and creative and the constraint that it also had to feel familiar and useful right out of the box. It’s a speciality that Apple, when it is at its best, continues to hold central to its development philosophy.
