**WebAssembly Summit 2020**  
https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6ed-L7Ni0yQ1pCKkw1g3QeN2BQxXvCPK#wassummit2020  
WebAssembly is undoubtedly going to become a more significant technology this decade, both in the browser and server side. These talks provide a glimpse at the cutting edge of the phenomenon with Lin Clark’s talk providing perhaps the best overview of the entire space.

**Fixing memory leaks in web applications**  
https://nolanlawson.com/2020/02/19/fixing-memory-leaks-in-web-applications/  
A poorly-coded SPA can easily eat up megabytes or even gigabytes of memory, continuing to gobble up more and more resources, even as it’s sitting innocently in a background tab. At this point, the page might start to slow to a crawl, or the browser may just terminate the tab and you’ll see Chrome’s familiar “Aw, snap!” page.

**When DIY Robots Invade**  
https://thereader.mitpress.mit.edu/when-diy-robots-invade/  
Technologies will soon make it far easier for anyone to make a custom robot. Will this result in a zoo of obnoxious, exotic new creatures?

**The New Business of AI (and How It’s Different From Traditional Software)**  
https://a16z.com/2020/02/16/the-new-business-of-ai-and-how-its-different-from-traditional-software/  
Just as SaaS ushered in a novel economic model compared to on-premise software, we believe AI is creating an essentially new type of business. So this post walks through some of the ways AI companies differ from traditional software companies and shares some advice on how to address those differences. Our goal is not to be prescriptive but rather help operators and others understand the economics and strategic landscape of AI so they can build enduring companies.

**2020 前端开源领域技术展望**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/yMg3kpmDaUL-p8iuhbo86Q  
可以说开源前端领域正如偏右所说的渡过了波澜不惊的2019年，2020年开启了下一个10年，站在这个起点展望前端的未来，必会面临巨大的变化和挑战。说实话，展望接下来的十年会发生什么？十年对于互联网，对于前端来说太长了，很难想象十年后会是什么一个场景，但这路上有些事情在我们看来正在发生。

**前端 DSL 实践指南（上）—— 内部 DSL**  
https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/107947462  
近几年，前端社区中 DSL 这个词开始频繁出镜，这和环境的变化有很大关系。本文作者由于工作经历上的特殊性，积累了一些关于前端 DSL 的实践经验（主要是外部 DSL），在所维护的开源项目中也有一些体现，同时作者在社区也有过一些不成体系的回答如《如何写一个类似 LESS 的编译工具》。这次我会尝试从前端开发的视角来完整探讨下 DSL 这个 「难以细说」 的议题。

**Same HTML, Different CSS**  
https://ishadeed.com/article/same-html-different-css/  
This is a step-by-step tutorial based on a concept from the old CSS Zen Garden site: Creating different designs via CSS while never touching the markup.

**Angular 9: Lazy Loading Components**  
https://johnpapa.net/angular-9-lazy-loading-components/  
Angular 9 has some pretty awesome new features. The runtime, code-name Ivy, opens the doors to things like making lazy load Angular components more straightforward than ever. This article shows you how to lazy load with Angular 9 and provides the code and resources along the way.

**The Serverless Supremacy, The Fall of the Monolith**  
https://blog.webiny.com/the-serverless-supremacy-204fbf5add75  
Serverless is still proving itself and it’s early days to say for sure that it’s the best thing ever that has happened to development. But I tend to believe that serverless is the future of development, it has to, especially because of the small companies. Literally quite opposite from what David was saying in his blog post. 另附：[When microservices might be the wrong choice](https://tyk.io/when-microservices-might-be-the-wrong-choice/).

**Application Models as Working Software**  
https://www.infoq.com/articles/application-models-software/  
A lightweight model of your application can be built in a just-in-time fashion. A model based on user flows can be used to involve all the disciplines in your product team in meaningful discussion and ideation.  The resulting model can be built out iteratively to support development and synchronization with what has been built.  The creation of a common language that the entire team can use will foster an inclusive team culture and pay rewards in development efficiency.

**The Zen of Go**  
https://dave.cheney.net/2020/02/23/the-zen-of-go  
Something that I’ve been thinking about a lot recently, when reflecting on the body of my own work, is a common subtitle, how should I write good code? Given nobody actively seeks to write bad code, this leads to the question; how do you know when you’ve written good Go code? If there’s a continuum between good and bad, how to do we know what the good parts are? What are its properties, its attributes, its hallmarks, its patterns, and its idioms?

**Notes on the Go translation of Reposurgeon**  
https://gitlab.com/esr/reposurgeon/blob/master/GoNotes.adoc  
A few years ago, Eric S Raymond thought Go could replace C in most situations, but now he’s done a rather extensive write up of his experiences in porting a complex program from Python to Go. The result is faster and easier to read, but he ran into a variety of problems.

**How 1500 bytes became the MTU of the internet**  
https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/post/why-is-ethernet-mtu-1500  
The MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit) states how big a single packet can be. Generally speaking, when you are talking to devices on your own LAN the MTU will be around 1500 bytes and the internet runs almost universally on 1500 as well. However, this does not mean that these link layer technologies can’t transmit bigger packets.

**Storage in the Exabyte Era**  
https://www.datanami.com/2020/02/19/storage-in-the-exabyte-era/  
Much of the growth in data generation (and data storage requirements) comes from unstructured data. Enterprises are on pace to triple the amount of unstructured data stored in file or object storage systems over the next four years, according to Gartner’s recent Magic Quadrant for Distributed File System and Object Storage. What’s more, it found that 40% of infrastructure and operations (I&O) leaders will implement at least one hybrid cloud storage architecture by 2024, up from just 10% last year. 另附：[Moore's Law Is Not Ending Soon And The Reason May Surprise You](http://highscalability.com/blog/2020/2/19/moores-law-is-not-ending-soon-and-the-reason-may-surprise-yo.html).

The five questions I used to help me decide, prioritize, and solve problems.

**Requirements volatility is the core problem of software engineering**  
https://stackoverflow.blog/2020/02/20/requirements-volatility-is-the-core-problem-of-software-engineering/  
It's now been more than 50 years since the first IFIP Conference on Software Engineering, and in that time there have been many different software engineering methodologies, processes, and models proposed to help software developers achieve that predictable and cost-effective process. But 50 years later, we still seem to see the same kinds of problems we always have: late delivery, unsatisfactory results, and complete project failures.

**Coding 4 Kids Inspires Future Engineers**  
https://tech.ebayinc.com/engineering/inspiring-future-engineers-with-coding-4-kids-workshops/  
Today's children are exposed to technology from a very young age, and on many occasions, 2-year-olds seem to understand the iPad better than adults. Is this enough to encourage and influence them to pursue a career in STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics)?

**The new Office app now generally available for Android and iOS**  
https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2020/02/19/new-office-app-android-ios-available/  
A few months ago, we introduced a new mobile app called Office—a whole new experience designed to be your go-to app for getting work done on a mobile device. It combines Word, Excel, and PowerPoint into a single app and introduces new capabilities that enable you to create content and accomplish tasks in uniquely mobile ways to help you achieve more. Today, we’re proud to announce the Office app is out of public preview and now generally available worldwide for anyone on Android and iOS phones. Remember late last year when it was revealed that [Microsoft was looking towards React Native](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2019/11/07/microsoft_react_native/) for their cross-platform app needs? Well, the new Office app is now powered in part by the mobile framework.

While some companies are phasing out transparency reporting, GitHub remains committed to maintaining transparency and promoting free expression as an essential part of our commitment to our users. A key example of this is ensuring we minimize the amount of data we disclose or the amount of content we take down as much as legally possible. Through our transparency reports, we’re continuing to shed light on our own practices, while also hoping to contribute to broader discourse on platform governance.

**The Bash Hackers Wiki**  
https://wiki.bash-hackers.org/  
This wiki is intended to hold documentation of any kind about GNU Bash. The main motivation was to provide human-readable documentation and information so users aren't forced to read every bit of the Bash manpage - which can be difficult to understand. However, the docs here are not meant as a newbie tutorial.

**Learn Rust With Entirely Too Many Linked Lists**  
https://rust-unofficial.github.io/too-many-lists/  
I fairly frequently get asked how to implement a linked list in Rust. The answer honestly depends on what your requirements are, and it's obviously not super easy to answer the question on the spot. As such I've decided to write this book to comprehensively answer the question once and for all. In this series I will teach you basic and advanced Rust programming entirely by having you implement 6 linked lists.

**How These Things Work – A book about CS from first principles**  
https://reasonablypolymorphic.com/book/preface  
Computer science is how I learned to do abstraction, and it is my most enrichingly- and economically- valuable skill. This is the final reason I offer to you why these things might be worth learning: it is strongly likely that you will make more money with them than without. As we will later see, abstraction is literally impossible to automate in the general case. This makes it a compelling skill to have in a world rapidly driving towards automating away most jobs. The debate whether or not that’s a good thing is left to minds smarter than my own, but you have to admit that it’s nice to have options.

**Looking at the Future – Design Trends of 2020**  
https://www.toptal.com/designers/ux/digital-design-trends-2020  
Every year a new crop of design trends emerges from the previous year’s labor. Some trends delight, some inspire, and some make our eyes ache. New grows old, and old is new again. Change is one of the most challenging and satisfying aspects of a career in design. The evolution of taste and technology keeps our skills sharp and demands we stay connected to the people we create for. As 2019 winds down, we’re looking ahead. We’ve identified 20 emerging design trends for 2020, but we’re not just listing fonts and colors. We’re showcasing game-changers and industry shakers that will define our experiential landscape for the year to come.

**How To Take Smart Notes: 10 Principles to Revolutionize Your Note-Taking and Writing**  
http s://praxis.fortelabs.co/how-to-take-smart-notes/  
My approach is based on the assumption that most books are a few morsels of real insight wrapped in layers and layers of fluff. As I read, I systematically unravel those layers of fluff and extract only those insights, like a chemist distilling only the purest compound.
But this book is not written in the usual way. It is written using an external thinking system, which I call a Second Brain.

以积极开朗的态度去突破困境。萧条越是严重，我们越是要咬紧牙关，坚忍不拔，下定决心，无论如何也要闯过这道难关。决不悲观，必须以积极开朗的态度应对难局。在这基础之上，重要的是要认识到“萧条是成长的机会”，企业就是应该通过萧条这样一种逆境来谋取更大的发展。

冷静观察、稳住阵脚、沉着应付、韬光养晦、有所作为。不搞争论，是我的一个发明。不争论，是为了争取时间干。一争论就复杂了，把时间都争掉了，什么也干不成。不争论，大胆地试，大胆地闯。空谈误国，实干兴邦。少说空话，多做工作，扎扎实实，埋头苦干。黑猫白猫，多抓老鼠是好猫！我们改革开放的成功，不是靠本本，而是靠实践，靠实事求是。从实践中学，从书本上学，从自己和人家的经验教训中学。要克服保守主义和本本主义。做老实人，说老实话，干老实事，就是实事求是。
