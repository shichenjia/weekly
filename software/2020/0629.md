And why I am trying to minimize my dependence on external libraries (whenever possible).

**Amazon Honeycode: A New AWS Tool to Build Database Apps without Code**  
https://aws.amazon.com/cn/blogs/aws/introducing-amazon-honeycode-build-web-mobile-apps-without-writing-code/  
https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/24/why-aws-built-a-no-code-tool/   
Build a better way to work: You need to manage your tasks, your projects, and your team. Now you can build an app to achieve your goals with Amazon [Honeycode](https://www.honeycode.aws/). No programming required. This new fully-managed AWS service gives you the power to build powerful mobile & web applications without writing any code. It uses the familiar spreadsheet model and lets you get started in minutes. If you or your teammates are already familiar with spreadsheets and formulas, you’ll be happy to hear that just about everything you know about sheets, tables, values, and formulas still applies. 

**What’s New in macOS Big Sur: Human Interface Guidelines**  
https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/macos/overview/whats-new-in-macos/  
When you build your app for macOS 11, you’ll find that most of the updates are automatic when you use system-defined elements with SwiftUI or Auto Layout; if your app is highly customized, you may have additional work to do. As you think about updating your app for macOS 11, review the following changes to help you plan your approach. 另附：[The End of OS X](https://stratechery.com/2020/the-end-of-os-x/).

**A roadmap to the web we want**  
https://webfoundation.org/2020/06/a-roadmap-to-the-web-we-want/  
We need all these vehicles to help us get to our destination: a safe and empowering digital world for all the world’s people. And we need the convening power of the United Nations and its digital roadmap to help us get there.

**中国工业软件失落的30年**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/FwaznfMD8f0KcyCQLPhvNA  
工业软件这个领域，不如航天科技这样高大上，没什么逾越不过的技术门槛，其尴尬的商业变现能力实在配不上巨大的商业价值，还容易被大众舆论忽视，觉得不自主也无所谓，可谓姥姥不疼舅舅不爱。可工业软件是工业的神经大脑，现在美国一禁止，我们就发现还是挺麻烦的，谁有都不如自己有好使。另附：[MATLAB遭禁用后，又一基础软件严查盗版](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/grpsQyJaYBQWqYEG6Xqlaw)。

How to publish components from a React web app and reuse them in a React-Electron desktop app.

**Sorry React, but I can’t keep up anymore**  
https://medium.com/swlh/sorry-react-but-i-cant-keep-up-anymore-6b6c8415708c  
JavaScript fatigue taking its toll. Keeping up with React and JavaScript can be exhausting — sometimes I’m genuinely afraid of falling behind the curve, leaving me with little time and energy to explore other things.

**美团外卖Flutter动态化实践**  
https://tech.meituan.com/2020/06/23/meituan-flutter-flap.html  
Flutter 跨端技术一经推出便在业内赢得了不错的口碑，它在“多端一致”和“渲染性能”上的优势让其他跨端方案很难比拟。虽然 Flutter 的成长曲线和未来前景看起来都很好，但不可否认的是，目前 Flutter 仍处在发展阶段，很多大型互联网企业都无法毫无顾虑地让全线 App 接入，而其中最主要的顾虑是包大小与动态化。动态化代表着更短的需求上线路径，代表着大大压缩了原始包的大小，从而获得更高的用户下载意向，也代表着更健全的线上质量维护体系。当明白这些意义后，我们也就不难理解，在 Flutter 的应用与适配趋近完善时，动态化自然就成为了一个无法避开的话题。RN 和 Weex 等成熟技术甚至让大家认为动态化是跨端技术的标配。美团外卖 MTFlutter 团队从 2019 年 9 月开始对动态化进行研究，目前已在多个业务模块上线，内部项目代号 “Flap” 。

**Is WebP really better than JPEG?**  
https://siipo.la/blog/is-webp-really-better-than-jpeg  
Since most of the time WebP is used alongside JPEG fallback, by using WebP you will essentially double your storage costs with little benefit. So, in the end, I would recommend using WebP in only the following cases: You have a lot of small images in the 500 px range. You can’t use MozJPEG. You pick an arbitrary fixed quality instead of using a metric like SSIM. In any case, when converting images to WebP, check that they are actually smaller than the JPEG equivalent. There’s no need to serve larger images to your users than needed.

**A little bit of plain Javascript can do a lot**  
https://jvns.ca/blog/2020/06/19/a-little-bit-of-plain-javascript-can-do-a-lot/  
Ten years ago I used to use jQuery, and since maybe 2017 I’ve been using a lot of vue.js for my little Javascript projects (you can see a little whack-a-mole game I made here as an intro to Vue). But last week, for the first time in a while, I wrote some plain Javascript without a library and it was fun so I wanted to talk about it a bit!

**An Overview of Scroll Technologies**  
https://css-tricks.com/an-overview-of-scroll-technologies/  
There are a number of scroll related technologies out there, so this article’s aim is to provide an overview of them and tools to help choose the one that’s right for you. I’d argue that these technologies can be broken down into two broad categories: ones for specific scroll-related behaviors and ones for more generic scroll-related behaviors.

**npm v7 Series - Why Keep `package-lock.json`?**  
https://blog.npmjs.org/post/621733939456933888/npm-v7-series-why-keep-package-lockjson  
One common question we’ve gotten a few times now, once we announce that npm v7 will include support for yarn.lock files, is “Why keep package-lock.json at all, then? Why not just use yarn.lock only?” The simple answer is: because yarn.lock doesn’t fully address npm’s needs, and relying on it exclusively would limit our ability to produce optimal package installs or add features in the future.

**Why you should use Node.js for data science**  
https://opensource.com/article/20/6/data-science-nodejs  
Node.js and other JavaScript libraries are excellent choices for data science. Here's why.

**Refactoring optional chaining into a large codebase: lessons learned**  
https://lea.verou.me/2020/06/refactoring-optional-chaining-into-a-large-codebase-lessons-learned/  
Now that optional chaining is supported across the board, I decided to finally refactor Mavo to use it (yes, yes, we do provide a transpiled version as well for older browsers, settle down). This is a moment I have been waiting for a long time, as I think optional chaining is the single most substantial JS syntax improvement since arrow functions and template strings. Yes, I think it’s more significant than async/await, just because of the mere frequency of code it improves. Property access is literally everywhere.

**Performance improvements in precise code intel**  
https://about.sourcegraph.com/blog/performance-improvements-in-precise-code-intel  
In Sourcegraph 3.16, we mentioned a rewrite of the services composing the precise-code-intel backend from TypeScript to Go. There were many reasons for this rewrite, but there's one particular reason that I'd like to explore here: We as a team know how to improve Go code that operates on large-scale data and we have less experience doing the same for TypeScript on the server side.

**Using the Blockly visual programming editor to call a .NET Core WebAPI**  
https://www.hanselman.com/blog/UsingTheBlocklyVisualProgrammingEditorToCallANETCoreWebAPI.aspx  
What .NET Core Blockly is doing is looking at the projection/interface of your WebAPI and generating Blockly blocks! That means that anyone (business users, student, tester, whatever) could try out your WebAPI with a simple drag and drop interface in their browser!

**Engineering Dropbox Transfer: Making simple even simpler**  
https://dropbox.tech/application/engineering-dropbox-transfer--making-simple-even-simpler  
As Dropbox Transfer adoption grows and the product expands and evolves, it remains important to reflect on its roots. The Transfer team remains committed not just to the “what,” of the product but the “why.” As we learn even more about our users from their feedback, we realize the process has just begun. Now every time we hear someone at the office or in a coffee shop complain about a file they were unable to send, we prick our ears, roll up our sleeves and smile, knowing that our work is not done yet. Best of all, my partner currently uses Transfer—and finally admits that I do useful things during the day.

**Learning operating system development using Linux kernel and Raspberry Pi**  
https://s-matyukevich.github.io/raspberry-pi-os/  
https://github.com/s-matyukevich/raspberry-pi-os  
This repository contains a step-by-step guide that teaches how to create a simple operating system (OS) kernel from scratch. I call this OS Raspberry Pi OS or just RPi OS. The RPi OS source code is largely based on Linux kernel, but the OS has very limited functionality and supports only Raspberry PI 3. Each lesson is designed in such a way that it first explains how some kernel feature is implemented in the RPi OS, and then it tries to demonstrate how the same functionality works in the Linux kernel. 另附：

**Looking back at five years of AMP**  
https://blog.amp.dev/2020/06/19/looking-back/  
MP is a web component framework to easily create user-first websites, stories, ads. With the support of the AMP community, we have aimed to live up to our mission of providing a content format that puts users first, and in doing so, helps support the success of every publisher, merchant, and advertiser on the web. With a half-decade of experience and many insights gained, we’re looking back at the origins of the project, lessons learned along the way, and what might lie in the future for AMP.

**I Just Hit $100k/yr On GitHub Sponsors! 🎉❤️ (How I Did It)**  
https://calebporzio.com/i-just-hit-dollar-100000yr-on-github-sponsors-heres-how-i-did-it  
SO many open source projects are started with enthusiasm and later abandoned. I believe, if working on those projects was financially sustainable, they would be better, grow bigger, and be maintained longer. Everyone would win.

**Splitgraph: A Code-Like Data Versioning and Management System**  
https://www.splitgraph.com/blog/introduction  
Splitgraph is a tool that makes working with data as easy as working with code. An oft-repeated trope is that data scientists spend 80% of their time cleaning data. This may not be strictly true, but certainly there is significant overhead for every deliverable. Software engineers have tools like Git and Docker that allow them to iterate and confidently deploy their code to production. For data scientists, the workflows in the experimentation phase are not nearly as productive. Too much effort is spent sourcing, cleaning and merging data together. And when it’s time to deploy a deliverable, it’s often impossible to keep it up to date without some sort of manual and brittle effort.

Now it’s time to dig into it and show you how information design exists in the world and why it’s important. Both inside your Visme editor and the world around you. First up, it’s possible that the term “information design” already sounds familiar. Do you instantly think of infographics ? You’d be right, in a sense. But there’s more. Much more. Hold on to your seats, let’s go!

**Video Games are the Future of Education**  
https://nabeelqu.co/education  
First, I suspect that optimizing directly for ‘being educational’ is a bad idea for video game creators. Most video games I’ve played that tried that were boring. It seems better to optimize for some combination of fun and complexity. Second, this post is not a call to “gamify” education or to slap gaming dynamics on top of education as an after-thought. That won’t work. One last thought: this is also why AI is important for human productivity. 另附：[Are Universities Going the Way of CDs and Cable TV?](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/06/university-like-cd-streaming-age/613291/).

**Andrew Yang is pushing Big Tech to pay users for data**  
https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21298919/andrew-yang-big-tech-data-dividend-project-facebook-google-ubi    
Andrew Yang wants people to get paid for the data they create on big tech platforms like Facebook and Google, and with a new project launching on Monday, he believes he can make it happen. Yang’s [Data Dividend Project](https://www.datadividendproject.com/) is a new program tasked with establishing data-as-property rights under privacy laws like the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) all across the country. The program hopes to mobilize over 1 million people by the end of the year, focusing primarily on Californians, and “pave the way for a future in which all Americans can claim their data as a property right and receive payment” if they choose to share their data with platforms.

https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/0Dk9EjxZQ_HlSzVEHfpAFQ

**蚂蚁 - 解决社会问题公司**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/8AdfVbTSsrC4xQJxMeRJ9g  
很多时候，打败你的只是因为“你老了”。对于阿里腾讯这样员工平均工资动辄数万的超大型公司，如何能持续“把手弄脏”，如何能持续抱有小镇青年那样的泥腿子精神，是摆在这些大公司面前一道很难过去的坎。技术很容易给人以虚幻的护城河。顶级的区块链技术、人脸识别技术以及OceanBase数据库，它是过往业务的结果，而不一定成为未来竞争的杀手锏，它们当然可以在场景中复用，但是这些技术因人而生，也有可能因人的转移和跳槽而为其他公司所获得。要是创新公司更聚焦、更年轻，就可能因资本的支持而聚拢资源一跃而起。所以，最核心的依然是解决问题能力，最核心的是依然从用户痛点出发的逻辑。这是任何创业组织的第一指挥棒。
