2020.08.24 - A clean start for the web  
========  

## 本期看点

**A clean start for the web**  
https://macwright.com/2020/08/22/clean-starts-for-the-web.html  
The web is in need of some reinvention right now. The web’s evolution over the last decade has mirrored the American economy. All of the essential indicators are going “up and to the right,” a steady stream of fundamental advances reassure use that there “is progress,” but the actual experience and effects for individuals stagnates or regresses. The crisis affects platforms, creators, and consumers alike.

**技术同学在业务中的成长**  
https://www.yuque.com/barretlee/thinking/lo6pnm  
上周看到有人提出了一个问题，大意是，“公司里头有很多部门，大部门的人员成长比小部门要好，可这也出现几个问题，一个是在大部门有机会去造大轮子，有更多场景，而小部门主要是在做业务；二是大部门内部晋升压力大，要是放到小部门可能早就升了，如何解释这些现象？”

**GPT-3 袭来，前端又要失业？谈谈如何实现智能切图**  
https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/188437243  
不仅是 GPT-3，所有现在的 AI 技术都不可能取代前端切图，只能在限定领域提供些辅助，比如代码自动完成提示、生成类似 H5 传单这种静态内容为主的页面，目前取代切图最好的方案是组件化及类似 amis 这样的低代码平台。而要想实现真正的智能切图，就得解决强人工智能（AI-complete）问题，别看现在很多方案号称准确率 7-80%，看着快接近了，其实剩下那 20% 是强人工智能问题，且不说这个问题恐怕永远解决不了，最大的悖论是如果你能解决，都可以能造出天网了统治人类了，还切啥页面呢。

**Highlighting great user experiences on the mobile web**  
https://blog.chromium.org/2020/08/highlighting-great-user-experiences-on.html  
we are excited to announce that Chrome will begin to highlight high quality user experiences on the web, starting with the labelling of fast links via the link context menu on Chrome for Android. This change will be rolling out starting in Chrome 85 Beta. Labelling is based on signals from the Core Web Vitals metrics that quantify key aspects of users’ experience, as experienced by real-world Chrome users.

**Leading-Trim: The Future of Digital Typesetting**  
https://medium.com/microsoft-design/leading-trim-the-future-of-digital-typesetting-d082d84b202  
How an emerging CSS standard can fix old problems and raise the bar for web apps.

**Are CRDTs suitable for shared editing?**  
https://blog.kevinjahns.de/are-crdts-suitable-for-shared-editing/  
In this article, I will introduce you to a simple optimization for CRDTs and examine the exact performance trade-off of using Yjs for shared editing. I hope to convince you that the overhead is actually very small even for large documents with long edit histories.

**零代码简史**  
https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/194186232  
不写代码，或者写很少的代码来构筑软件并不是全新的概念。在上世纪八九十年代，在企业软件发展的早期就有影响力很大的标杆产品。在云计算技术发展起来以后，这个门类焕发了新的生机。构筑云原生应用变得更加简单和直接，所有基于APaaS构筑的应用显然都是不依赖服务器的（Serverless），它甚至模糊了开发和使用的边界，使用者即是开发者，开发者当然也可以作为直接使用者。2014年，市场研究公司Forrestor正式提出了Low-Code的概念，并将相关品类称为Low-Code Application Platform（LCAP）。Gartner随后用高生产力应用平台（hpaPaaS）来命名这个品类。近两年，全行业对零代码/低代码平台的品类定义开始集中在“APaaS”这个称谓上。在这个品类发展过程中，自然演化出两种基本技术路径。

**前端性能优化实践 之 百度App个人主页优化**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/DBKTVhD04kc_LNrD53BYBw  
性能是每个前端工程师都应该关注的话题，通用的优化手段已有许多文章和实践，就不再赘述，本篇以百度 App 个人主页为例，聊聊针对业务特点进行的一些性能优化实践。
适用于：传统意义的优化手段能用的都用了：打包拆包，缩减体积和 HTTP 请求数、CDN 和按需加载等，但性能方面仍不太理想。

**OpenJS World Keynote Series: Exploring the History of JavaScript**  
https://openjsf.org/blog/2020/08/21/openjs-world-keynote-series-exploring-the-history-of-javascript/  
Addintion: [OpenJS World Keynote: How not to Save the World with Tech](https://openjsf.org/blog/2020/08/20/openjs-world-keynote-how-not-to-save-the-world-with-tech/).

**Web History - The Website**  
https://css-tricks.com/chapter-3-the-website/  
The very first website was about the web. That kind of thing is not all that unusual. The first email sent to another person was about email As technology progresses, we may have lost a bit of theatrics. The first telegraph, for instance, read “WHAT HATH GOD WROUGHT.” However, in most cases, telecommunication firsts follow this meta template.

**The Languages Which Almost Became CSS**  
https://eager.io/blog/the-languages-which-almost-were-css/  
While these languages are obviously not in common use today, I find it fascinating to think about the world that might have been. Even more surprisingly, it happens that many of these other options include features which developers would love to see appear in CSS even today.

**Web by Google (TM)**  
https://landshark.io/2020/08/16/web-by-google.html  
So Google controls the Web’s search and video infrastructure. It can and does dictate standards and media formats. It also controls a huge chunk of the revenues available when publishing and selling on the Web. It even controls the operating system and browser through which most people interact with it. Google’s capture of the Web is a fait accompli. Only legislation will keep the World Wide Web from finally becoming Web by Google (TM).

**Chromium’s impact on root DNS traffic**  
https://blog.apnic.net/2020/08/21/chromiums-impact-on-root-dns-traffic/  
Chromium has, since its early days, included a feature known as the omnibox, which allows users to enter either a website name, URL, or search terms. But the omnibox has an interface challenge. The user might enter a word like “marketing” that could refer to both an (intranet) website and a search term. Which should the browser choose to display? Chromium treats it as a search term but also displays an infobar that says something like “did you mean http://marketing/?” if a background DNS lookup for the name results in an IP address.

**Asynchronous computing @Facebook: Driving efficiency and developer productivity at Facebook scale**  
https://engineering.fb.com/production-engineering/async/  
The original Async was a simple system, but as our apps and services have grown, we needed to scale to manage a greater volume of requests. At Systems @Scale, we are sharing how we’ve reimagined Async to scale to handle billions of requests as efficiently as possible.  

**How Shopify Reduced Storefront Response Times with a Rewrite**  
https://engineering.shopify.com/blogs/engineering/how-shopify-reduced-storefront-response-times-rewrite  
In January 2019, we set out to rewrite the critical software that powers all online storefronts on Shopify’s platform to offer the fastest online shopping experience possible, entirely from scratch and without downtime.

**Keeping sync fast with automated performance regression detection**  
https://dropbox.tech/infrastructure/keeping-sync-fast-with-automated-performance-regression-detectio  
Sync is a hard distributed systems problem and re-writing the heart of our sync engine on the desktop client was a monumental effort. We’ve previously discussed our efforts to heavily test durability at different layers of the system. Today, we are going to talk about how we ensured the performance of our new sync engine.

**Rebuilding messaging: How we built for extensibility**  
https://engineering.linkedin.com/blog/2020/building-for-extensibility  
In the previous blog posts of our “Rebuilding messaging” series, we shared the process of how we designed the system from high-level product and engineering requirements, and how we bootstrapped the data. In this post, we’ll explore why we made extensibility a core aspect of our messaging platform, what that meant for our partner teams, and how we got it done.

**fast.ai releases new deep learning course, four libraries, and 600-page book**  
https://www.fast.ai/2020/08/21/fastai2-launch/

**Make it Automatic: Tuning SQL with AI**  
https://www.datanami.com/2020/08/20/make-it-automatic-tuning-sql-with-ai/  
With multiple resource types across multiple hardware platforms, and add to this, trends like DevOps CI/CD automation and cloud adoption, the DBA’s job and the pressure on them to track SQL execution performance can be quite intensive.  Utilizing Artificial Intelligence (AI) for SQL tuning can help DBAs and developers reap the benefits of a true automated process.

**Factorio and Software Engineering**  
https://blog.nindalf.com/posts/factorio-and-software-engineering/  
I’ve been a software engineer a while now and I can say this with confidence - it is fun. It’s great and I wouldn’t trade it for anything else. It’s so much fun that some folks try to capture the most enjoyable elements and put them into games. I’ve played two such games. The first is Shenzhen.io. This one looks similar to what an engineer working on embedded devices would see. You solve puzzles by writing assembly code on low power devices. What makes this game great is that they remove the annoying parts of writing and shipping code. The second game is [Factorio](https://factorio.com/blog/post/fff-360), this game reminds me of software engineering more than any other. Let me explain why.

**Open problems in Robotics**  
https://scottlocklin.wordpress.com/2020/07/29/open-problems-in-robotics/  
There really aren’t any lists in open problems in robotics, I am assuming because it would be a depressingly long litany. I figured I would assemble one; one which I assume will be gratuitously incomplete and occasionally wrong, but which makes up for all that by actually existing. Like my list of open problems in physics and astronomy, I could very well be wrong about some of these, or behind the times, and since my expertise consists in google and 5-10 year old conversations with a cool dude between deadlifts, but it seems worth doing.

**Introducing The ReadME Project**  
https://github.blog/2020-08-20-readme-project/  
Open source powers software on a planetary scale: 99% of code is built on it. The rewards and challenges of creating open source are deeply familiar to the maintainers and developers who create it, but they often go unseen by others. We read a lot about the preeminence of software, less so about the communities of people pouring their efforts and passions into it. This is why we’re launching The ReadME Project, a new space for the community to share their stories, and to learn from each other.
