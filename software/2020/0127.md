**Why build this blog - or anything - on IPFS?**  
http://teetotality.blog/posts/why-ipfs/  
As I see it, the interesting arguments for IPFS boil down to these three: Ownership, control, censorship; Resilience; Elegance. These advantages are, to varying degrees, abstract and aspirational. Building anything on IPFS in 2020 represents a bet on a future in which priorities have changed, and engineering decisions are therefore made differently. Put another way: IPFS is a technology that belongs to a certain class of futures - a technology that will thrive in those futures (but not others), and that may help to bring them about.

**How to manage a program in a product-mode organization**  
https://martinfowler.com/articles/programs-in-product-mode.html  
In their ideal state, [product-mode organizations](https://martinfowler.com/articles/products-over-projects.html) are formed of loosely coupled, autonomous teams that respond rapidly to articulated and unarticulated user needs. On occasion however, opportunities arise that require a response involving coordination across multiple teams. If not managed effectively the outcome will result in missed revenue, unsatisfied customers and wasted team capacity. We refer to the organizational initiatives that respond to these opportunities as programs. In this article, we’ll share our experience managing programs in product-mode organizations through an example of a program gone bad.

**Today, the Trident Era Ends**  
https://schepp.dev/posts/today-the-trident-era-ends/  
Starting now, Microsoft will roll out their new Chromium-based Edge browser to their millions of Windows 10 users. And this will also mark the end of an era. The era of the Trident-Engine. Coming back to my introductory part on ancient civilizations and their achievements: For me, it feels like Internet Explorer already had many of the things that we came to reinvent later and that we now celebrate as innovations. Although our modern reinventions offer more features combined with better developer experience, I came to wonder why we, as a community, only picked up very few of them. Looking at the above list, I would say that Microsoft was lightyears ahead of everyone else in regards to providing tools and solutions for architecting complex and delightful websites. Some syntax may look unfamiliar to us, but this is just because we are not used to it.

**New browser on the block: Flow**  
https://www.ekioh.com/flow-browser/  
2020 is only three weeks old, but there has been a lot of browser news that decreases rendering engine diversity. It’s time for some good news on that front: a new rendering engine, [Flow](https://www.ekioh.com/flow-browser/). Below I conduct an interview with Piers Wombwell, Flow’s lead developer. Flow: Ekioh’s multi-core HTML5 browser leads the way into a new era of high performance with low resource requirements.  It dramatically improves layout performance by using multithreading to position elements simultaneously.  Because Flow is also designed to use GPU rendering, it can deliver over twice the frame rate of other browsers.

**Svelte - a recipe for a successful framework?**  
https://areknawo.com/svelte-a-recipe-for-a-successful-framework/  
As in this post I want to talk a little about such a "disruptive framework", which, right now, is Svelte. If you watch the world of web development closely, you might know that it's a relatively new player to the framework game. With that said, it's even more surprising that's it's being compared to "industry standards", such as React, Vue, and Angular. But why is this so, and is there some kind of a recipe for a successful framework? That's what we'll try to uncover today!

**The 10 most important JavaScript frameworks of the past decade**  
https://blog.logrocket.com/10-most-important-javascript-frameworks-past-decade/  
We’ve witnessed various JS frameworks pop up left and right. Some have changed the way we build software entirely, while others have not been able to stand the test of time, so I thought it would be nice to reflect on all the JavaScript frameworks that have influenced us as developers in one way or another this past decade. These are frameworks that may have revolutionized the way we build software. They were on the bleeding edge of advancements and usually challenged the status quo to usher in a new era of software development. 另附：[20 Top Frontend Developers Tools in 2020](https://blog.bitsrc.io/20-top-frontend-developers-tools-in-2020-78eeb1b2da5a).

**Standards for Writing Accessibly**  
https://alistapart.com/article/standards-for-writing-accessibly/  
Writing to meet WCAG2 standards can be a challenge, but it’s worthwhile. Albert Einstein, the archetypical genius and physicist, once said, “Any fool can make things bigger, more complex, and more violent. It takes a touch of genius—and a lot of courage—to move in the opposite direction.”

**Min and Max Width/Height in CSS**  
https://ishadeed.com/article/min-max-css/  
Oftentimes, we want to limit the width of an element relative to its parent, and at the same time, to make it dynamic. So having a base width or height with the ability to make it extend based on the available space. Let’s say, for example, that we have a button that should have a minimum width, where it shouldn’t go below it. This is where the maximum and minimum properties become handy.

**Deno: Will It Replace Node?**  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puXyo1jGQys  
Over the past couple of years, we’ve mentioned [Deno](https://deno.land/) a few times. It’s a 'new' JavaScript and TypeScript runtime initially created by Ryan Dahl, the creator of Node, so it’s interesting to see how he thinks things should be done nowadays. Version 1.0 is due soon.  
A decade after Node.js was first announced, JavaScript and the web platform have evolved, and TypeScript has changed the way JS applications are developed. Deno is a new JavaScript/TypeScript runtime that was designed with all those new capabilities in mind.

**Lyft’s Journey through Mobile Networking**  
https://eng.lyft.com/lyfts-journey-through-mobile-networking-d8e13c938166  
In 5 years, the number of endpoints consumed by Lyft’s mobile apps grew to over 500, and the size of our mobile engineering team increased by more than 15x. To scale with this growth, our infrastructure had to evolve dramatically to utilize new advances in modern networking in order to continue to provide benefits for our users. This post describes the journey through the evolution of Lyft’s mobile networking: how it’s changed, what we’ve learned, and why it’s important for us as a growing business.

**Istio as an Example of When Not to Do Microservices**  
https://blog.christianposta.com/microservices/istio-as-an-example-of-when-not-to-do-microservices/  
I’ve been pretty invested in helping organizations with their cloud-native journeys for the last five years. Modernizing and improving a team (and eventually an organization’s) velocity to deliver software-based technology is heavily influenced by its people, process and eventual technology decisions. A microservices approach may be appropriate when the culmination of an application’s architecture has become a bottleneck (as a result of the various people/process/tech factors) for making changes and “going faster”, but it is not the only approach. Microservices is not THE “utopian application architecture”.

**Discovering millions of datasets on the web**  
https://blog.google/products/search/discovering-millions-datasets-web/  
Across the web, there are millions of datasets about nearly any subject that interests you. If you’re looking to buy a puppy, you could find datasets compiling complaints of puppy buyers or studies on puppy cognition. Or if you like skiing, you could find data on revenue of ski resorts or injury rates and participation numbers. [Dataset Search](https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/) has indexed almost 25 million of these datasets, giving you a single place to search for datasets and find links to where the data is. Over the past year, people have tried it out and provided feedback, and now Dataset Search is officially out of beta.

**My FOSS(Free and Open Source Software) Story**  
https://blog.burntsushi.net/foss/  
Being a FOSS maintainer has given me a lot of interesting experiences. Some bad, some good. I've tried to express some of those experiences in this article with the goal of helping everyone understand each other better. This article doesn't necessarily generalize because these experiences are told through my perception of the world. My hope is that others will use these experiences to reflect on their own and perhaps the experiences of others. I think this process can lead to greater empathy and an overall better experience for everyone. In this article, I listed a lot of behaviors that I considered negative. Not everyone will see them as negatively as I do. That's okay and expected. 

**Go's Tooling is an Undervalued Technology**  
https://nullprogram.com/blog/2020/01/21/  
Regardless of your opinions of the Go programming language, the primary implementation of Go, gc, is an incredible piece of software engineering. Everyone ought to be blown away by it! Yet not only is it undervalued in general, even the Go community itself doesn’t fully appreciate it. It’s not perfect, but it has unique features never before seen in a toolchain. In this article, when I say “Go” I’m referring to the gc compiler.

**What is Rust and why is it so popular?**  
https://stackoverflow.blog/2020/01/20/what-is-rust-and-why-is-it-so-popular/  
Rust has been Stack Overflow’s most loved language for four years in a row, indicating that many of those who have had the opportunity to use Rust have fallen in love with it. However, the roughly 97% of survey respondents who haven’t used Rust may wonder, “What’s the deal with Rust?” The short answer is that Rust solves pain points present in many other languages, providing a solid step forward with a limited number of downsides. I’ll show a sample of what Rust offers to users of other programming languages and what the current ecosystem looks like. It’s not all roses in Rust-land, so I talk about the downsides, too.

**We're proud to introduce AVA 3!**  
https://github.com/avajs/ava/releases/tag/v3.0.0  
When we began AVA, JavaScript was very different. Most syntax you find familiar today was not supported by Node.js. Instead we relied on Babel to support that syntax before it made its way to Node.js itself. These days most new stage-4 syntax is adopted quickly. It's often not necessary to transpile anything. Therefore we're removing our built-in Babel support from AVA itself. AVA now interrupts your tests if there's no progress for 10 seconds. Use the timeout configuration or --timeout CLI option to change this.

**Efficient Ways to Conduct Heuristic Evaluation for Your Agile Product**  
https://uxplanet.org/efficient-ways-to-conduct-heuristic-evaluation-for-your-agile-product-137a4ae4f52d  
“Good, Fast and Cheap” a product can be any two of these but never all three. In recent years, many UX methodologies have been created to help designers to find out problems as well as rooms for product improvement efficiently. However, as we are living in the Agile world, “Good” and “Fast” are the most important criteria that should be sticked with. In this case, Heuristic Evaluation is a good choice, or rather, the compass for our product design strategy.

**Machine Language – A Guide to Chatbot Terminology (with Infographic)**  
https://www.toptal.com/designers/chatbot-designers/chatbot-terminology  
At one end of the spectrum exist the doomsayers, the conspiratorialists that believe chatbots are becoming more human than their creators, and it’s only a matter of time before WE’RE answering inane questions for THEM. At the other end, we have the AI evangelists, who pine for a day when bots overtake every task that humans find undesirable, all to the tune of ever-increasing profits. There’s ample misinformation, but we aim to cut through the exaggeration and break things down nice n’ simple. This infographic is nothing but straight talk—the most important chatbot concepts that anyone needs to know in order to have an expert-level conversation.

**微信视频号（短内容）想要什么？**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/ZAvvgsuXoy0RhwanOQ2t-g  
很多人会把视频号当作是微信和抖音、快手的竞争，如果从时间线上来看，有些人会认为是迟到的防御。在我看来，微信做「短内容」既不是竞争，也不是防御，而是微信无心插柳做成了中国最大的内容平台后的能力补全。出发点不同，会导致产品战略的不同。拿抖音和视频号做对比，并不是一个合适的做法。人们总是希望从微信里获得「红利」，视频号可能是一种有节制的红利，对于某些人来说。而对于另一些人，比如我，可能很难玩得起来。我看到的不仅是视频号，还看到了微信持续从通信工具变成连接工具。
