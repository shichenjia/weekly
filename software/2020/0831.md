**React vs. Svelte: The War Between Virtual and Real DOM**  
https://blog.bitsrc.io/react-vs-sveltejs-the-war-between-virtual-and-real-dom-59cbebbab9e9  
I recently had the pleasure of playing around with Svelte and learned how to build a simple shopping cart application. Moreover, I couldn’t help but notice many similarities it has with React. It’s surprising to see how well of a contender it can be, to one of the most popular JavaScript libraries for building user interfaces. In this article, I’m going to compare Svelte vs. React and how they fare against each other behind the scenes.

**Is Blazor The Future of Development?**  
https://ilikekillnerds.com/2020/08/is-blazor-the-future-of-development/  
[Blazor](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor) is a framework that will allow developers to write applications targeting different platforms, with the web being the first priority. Right now, you can already write HTML, CSS and C# to create Blazor based web applications. By default, Blazor is a web-first framework made evident by the parts they have released so far. Additional: [Blazor VS JavaScript](https://blog.bitsrc.io/frontend-dev-blazor-vs-javascript-35f27e0fd618), [Blazor vs. Angular](https://blog.logrocket.com/blazor-vs-angular/).

**How to do cross platform GUI?**  
https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24242412  
In essentially every discussion about desktop applications there are a lot of comments about how not to build desktop apps, but very little sharing of resources showing how to do it right. I’ve seen people defend electron, talk about core logic in a cross platform language and native gui code and any number of other options. As a middle of the road developer I think it’s difficult to find any consensus (besides electron being both simple and hated). What resources are there for building quality, functional cross platform desktop application?

**Jamstack - JavaScript, APIs, and Markup**  
https://jamstack.org/  
Fast and secure sites and apps delivered by pre-rendering files and serving them directly from a CDN, removing the requirement to manage or run web servers. Additional: [Going Jamstack with React, Serverless, and Airtable](https://css-tricks.com/going-jamstack-with-react-serverless-and-airtable/).

**Flutter for Web: An Ultimate Guide**  
https://dev.to/karan_shah89/flutter-for-web-an-ultimate-guide-2j76  
Flutter is actively working towards extending the same codebase towards anything with a screen: Android, iOS, Web, and Desktop seamlessly. With some extra effort - you can essentially use the same codebase to create apps for responsive web (competing with SPA frameworks such as React, Angular, and Vue) and for the Desktop (competing with Electron and Qt) and hopefully embedded devices and more in future.

**Scott：总结 10 年前端经验，谈谈前端人如何更快地成长**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/8T-No_rrEM1rEculZiV9Tg  
三十年河东、三十年河西。这句话放到前端领域，就要变成 “十年河东、十年河西”，甚至每隔三五年，前端行业的技术格局就会大面积翻新。对于资深的前端开发者来说，已经适应了这种更新迭代的频率，嘴上说着“学不动了”却依旧乐于学习新工具、新框架。但对于前端新人来说，面对诸多语言、框架和工具，如何选择一套适合自己的技术栈依然是一个让人头疼的问题。前端人如何选择自己的技术栈？前端人如何更快地成长？带着这些问题，前端之巅采访了拥有 10 年工程师经验的 Scott。

**How Microfrontends Improved Our Team’s Productivity**  
https://medium.com/javascript-in-plain-english/how-microfrontends-improved-our-teams-productivity-79538ba6618b  
An application for more than 10 teams can be hard to evolve, but the use of micro frontends has improved product quality and greatly increased our productivity.

**Designing a JavaScript Plugin System**  
https://css-tricks.com/designing-a-javascript-plugin-system/  
WordPress has plugins. jQuery has plugins. Gatsby, Eleventy, and Vue do, too. Plugins are a common feature of libraries and frameworks, and for a good reason: they allow developers to add functionality, in a safe, scalable way. This makes the core project more valuable, and it builds a community — all without creating an additional maintenance burden. What a great deal! So how do you go about building a plugin system? Let’s answer that question by building one of our own, in JavaScript.

**A tale of webpage speed, or throwing away React**  
https://solovyov.net/blog/2020/a-tale-of-webpage-speed-or-throwing-away-react/  
TwinSpark approach - [htmx](https://htmx.org/docs/) is much better in most cases for the user: less JavaScript, less jitter, more common HTML-like behavior. In the worst case, we would serve you 2.5MB of minified (non-gzipped) JS and 700KB of HTML (half of it were initial data for React) for catalogue. Right now it’s 40KB of minified non-gzipped JS (TwinSpark, analytics, some behavior, IntersectionObserver polyfill) and 350KB of HTML. Two orders of magnitude difference and even HTML is smaller! This is just like Christmas in childhood!

**Minimal React: getting started with the frontend library**

**A Guide to Commonly Used React Component Libraries**  
https://maxrozen.com/guide-to-component-ui-libraries-react/  
In making this list, I’ve attempted to avoid corporate design systems, however some (Material UI) have achieved such widespread adoption that this list would be incomplete without them. I’ve also intentionally left out CSS-in-JS such as styled-components and Emotion, and utility CSS systems such as Tailwind, as they are not explicitly “React Component libraries”, but rather tools with which to make your components.

**Serverless-Flow: A CI/CD Branching Workflow Optimized for Speed and Quality**  
https://medium.com/serverless-transformation/serverless-flow-a-ci-cd-branching-workflow-optimized-for-speed-and-quality-6b98c5a4e489  
“Serverless-Flow” is similar to GitHub Flow, but takes advantage of the ephemeral pay-per-use environments Serverless offers. There are 4 steps to getting to Serverless-Flow on your CI/CD: 1. Isolating Environment Deployments; 2. Integration Test Coverage; 3. Branching Workflow — Serverless Flow; 4. Cleanup.

**Docs As the Code, Docs In the Code At New Relic**  
https://blog.newrelic.com/engineering/docs-as-code-docs-in-code/  
Software is made of words. Some words, such as UI text or command-line messages, are for human-computer interaction; some, like API calls and error codes, target other software; and some form the documentation—README files, user guides, online help, and more. The vast majority of words in software, though, are its source code: those words that make it run.

**Monorepos**  
https://vercel.com/blog/monorepos  
Vercel now supports monorepos for improved flexibility at scale. From the same Git repository, you can set up multiple projects to be built and deployed in parallel.

**How We’re Able to Host 1 Million Sites per MongoDB Cluster**  
https://www.wix.engineering/post/how-we-re-able-to-host-1-million-sites-per-mongodb-cluster  
When you need to store millions of databases with multiple collections efficiently, what do you do? This is exactly the question we asked ourselves a year and a half after having launched Corvid (then called Wix Code). Corvid is a serverless code platform for site builders, which lets developers add frontend and backend code to their Wix sites. Part of Corvid is a product called Wix Data. 

**Optimized shot-based encodes for 4K: Now streaming!**

https://github.blog/2020-08-25-upgrading-github-to-ruby-2-7/  
After many months of work, we deployed GitHub to production using Ruby 2.7 in July. For those who aren’t familiar with GitHub’s stack, we’ve been running on Ruby since the beginning. Many years ago, we ran GitHub on a fork of Ruby (and Rails!) and while that hasn’t been the case for some time, that experience taught us how important it is to keep up with new releases.
