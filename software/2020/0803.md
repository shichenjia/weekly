**Making Facebook.com accessible to as many people as possible**  
https://engineering.fb.com/web/facebook-com-accessibility/  
We recently shared the work we did to rebuild our tech stack to support the redesigned Facebook.com. When that project began, we saw an opportunity to integrate greater accessibility into the site and build it into the foundation in a way we couldn’t have done without this rebuild. The previous site had been built upon in layers since its launch in 2004, resulting in a large and complex site. This complexity made it difficult to incorporate sweeping changes without causing regressions. 另附：[Facebook Design: 5 Ways to Integrate Accessible Design into Fast-paced Projects](https://medium.com/facebook-design/5-ways-to-integrate-accessible-design-into-fast-paced-projects-26eca345d23a).  

**GitHub public roadmap**  
https://github.com/github/roadmap  
https://github.com/github/roadmap/projects/1  
Our product roadmap is where you can learn about what features we're working on, what stage they're in, and when we expect to bring them to you. The roadmap repository is for communicating GitHub’s roadmap. Existing issues are currently read-only, and we are locking conversations, as we get started. Interaction limits are also in place to ensure issues originate from GitHub. We’re planning to iterate on the format of the roadmap itself, and we see potential to engage more in discussions about the future of GitHub products and features. 另附：[Microsoft 365 Roadmap](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/roadmap).

**Philosophers On GPT-3**  
http://dailynous.com/2020/07/30/philosophers-gpt-3/  
Nine philosophers explore the various issues and questions raised by the newly released language model, GPT-3, in this edition of Philosophers On, guest edited by Annette Zimmermann. 另附：[How GPT3 Works - Visualizations and Animations](https://jalammar.github.io/how-gpt3-works-visualizations-animations/), [Teaching GPT-3 to Identify Nonsense](https://arr.am/2020/07/25/gpt-3-uncertainty-prompts/), [GPT-3, Beyond the Hype](https://a16z.com/2020/07/29/16mins-gpt3-natural-language-neural-net-deep-learning-few-shot-zero-shot/), [Podcast 256: You down with GPT-3?

**Using Chrome to generate more accessible PDFs**  
https://blog.chromium.org/2020/07/using-chrome-to-generate-more.html  
Starting in Chrome 85 (scheduled to go to stable in late August), Chrome will automatically generate a tagged PDF when you print a web page and choose the "Save as PDF" destination. A tagged PDF is one that contains extra metadata about the structure of a document, including things like headings, lists, tables, paragraphs, and image descriptions. 

**Connecting tasks experiences across Microsoft 365**  
https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-365-blog/connecting-tasks-experiences-across-microsoft-365/ba-p/1522069  
In this new normal, Microsoft’s vision for a unified tasks experience, which we first announced at Ignite last year, is more relevant than ever. Since then, we’ve made significant progress in creating a coherent, integrated, and intelligent experience to help you stay organized. Microsoft Teams, Microsoft Outlook, Microsoft Planner, Microsoft To Do, and Office—specifically, Word, Excel, and PowerPoint—all play a role in the Microsoft 365 tasks experience.

**Speculation in JavaScriptCore**  
https://webkit.org/blog/10308/speculation-in-javascriptcore/  
This post is all about speculative compilation, or just speculation for short, in the context of the JavaScriptCore virtual machine. Speculative compilation is ideal for making dynamic languages, or any language with enough dynamic features, run faster. In this post, we will look at speculation for JavaScript.

**满眼只有React和Vue，却对前端数据层几乎一无所知**  
https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/165213964  
不是我冒犯，包括我自己在内，如果满眼都是React和Vue之类的前端框架、库，那么可以说，对前端数据层几乎一无所知，就算把前端框架玩的贼溜，对前端架构的理解，也不过是井底蛙之王。

**I created the exact same app in React and Vue. Here are the differences. [2020 Edition]**  
https://sunilsandhu.com/posts/i-created-the-exact-same-app-in-react-and-vue-2020-edition  
Now with React Hooks vs Vue 3 + Composition API! There are, of course, lots of other little differences and quirks between React and Vue, but hopefully the contents of this article has helped to serve as a bit of a foundation for understanding how both frameworks handle stuff.

**Simulating Object Collisions With Canvas**  
https://joshbradley.me/object-collisions-with-canvas/  
I used this project as my introduction to JavaScript’s canvas and creating a physics simulation. It took me an embarrassingly long time to perfect so I figured it would be worth sharing.

**GOTO 2020 • HTML: How to Make Loveliness • Bruce Lawson**  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L83LVfhTbzg  
You’re a PHP ninja. You’re a React god. You’re a magician with Sketch. But if your code is assembling HTML to get delivered to a user’s browser, how much do you know about HTML’s semantics? Choosing the correct HTML elements rather than vomiting a "div" or belching out a "span" can greatly enhance the end user’s experience, with no fragile extra code to write and maintain. One of the co-editors of the HTML5.3 spec will take you on a magical treasure hunt around HTML, showing you marvellous gifts and hidden wonders that will also help future-proof your code and turn you into a time-travelling front-end superhero.

**How we migrated Dropbox from Nginx to Envoy**  
https://dropbox.tech/infrastructure/how-we-migrated-dropbox-from-nginx-to-envoy  
In this blogpost we’ll talk about the old Nginx-based traffic infrastructure, its pain points, and the benefits we gained by migrating to Envoy. We’ll compare Nginx to Envoy across many software engineering and operational dimensions. We’ll also briefly touch on the migration process, its current state, and some of the problems encountered on the way. When we moved most of Dropbox traffic to Envoy, we had to seamlessly migrate a system that already handles tens of millions of open connections, millions of requests per second, and terabits of bandwidth. This effectively made us into one of the biggest Envoy users in the world. 

**Migrating a 40TB SQL Server Database**  
https://www.tarynpivots.com/post/migrating-40tb-sql-server-database/  
Initially, I wasn’t sure whether to write about this migration project, but when I randomly asked if people would be interested, the response was overwhelming. This was a long, kind of boring, very repetitive, and at times incredibly frustrating project, but I learned a lot, and maybe someone else will learn from this too. There may be far better ways to move this amount of data. In the path I went down, there was a huge amount of juggling that had to take place (I’ll explain that later). Thankfully, I’m a decent juggler.

**Is serverless cheaper for your use case? Find out with this calculator**  
https://medium.com/serverless-transformation/is-serverless-cheaper-for-your-use-case-find-out-with-this-calculator-2f8a52fc6a68  
When talking about serverless, cost savings and auto-scaling are the first benefits that come to mind. Companies expect reduced operations time and lower costs to deliver more value on features critical to their business. A dream (at least for investors). I guess you’ve read this theory a few times already. And still, how can you be sure that serverless is the right fit for you? That your use case is indeed cheaper with serverless?

**Designing Adaptive Components, Beyond Responsive Breakpoints**  
https://stephaniewalter.design/blog/designing-adaptive-components-beyond-responsive-breakpoints/  
In the talk, I show how I design systems of components that go beyond responsive adaptation to different screen/viewport size and can also be used in different layout and container contexts. I also try to make sure that my components work beyond the perfect “happy path perfect situation”: what happens with super long text, missing images/content for example? And how about adapting components to user needs across specific points in their journey and build truly adaptive systems?
