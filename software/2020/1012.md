**The Widening Responsibility for Front-End Developers**  
https://css-tricks.com/the-widening-responsibility-for-front-end-developers/  
Front-end development is at the intersection of art and logic. A cross of business and expression. Both left and right brain. A cocktail of design and nerdery. I love it.

**Writing JavaScript tools in other languages – a new trend?**  
https://2ality.com/2020/10/js-plus-other-languages.html  
Recently, we have seen an uptick of JavaScript tools being written in languages other than JavaScript. This blog post lists a few examples and explains the appeal of not using JavaScript. Releated: [Boa - An experimental Javascript lexer, parser and compiler written in Rust](https://boa-dev.github.io/), [Volta: Install, Run, and Manage JavaScript Tools Quickly, built in Rust and ships as a snappy static binary](https://volta.sh/).

**What’s In The Future For JavaScript?**  
https://blog.bitsrc.io/whats-in-the-future-for-javascript-b58fc736f1c3  
The predictions of a software developer who’s seen the language evolve for the past 17 years. What’s in our near future and what will happen 20 or more years from now?

**Four principles of software engineering**  
https://drewdevault.com/2020/10/09/Four-principles-of-software-engineering.html  
Software should be robust, Software should be reliable, Software should also be stable. Finally, software should be simple.

**Developing For The Semantic Web**  
https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/10/developing-semantic-web/  
The dream of a machine-readable Internet is as old as the Internet itself, but only in recent years has it really seemed possible. As major websites take strides towards data-fying their content, now’s the perfect time to jump on the bandwagon.

**Imperative vs Declarative Programming – the Difference Explained in Plain English**  
https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/imperative-vs-declarative-programming-difference/  
As a coding instructor, it’s my duty to send programmers out into the world thinking in new ways. A major shift in thinking occurs when we switch from imperative to declarative programming. Releted: [Functional Programming in JavaScript Explained in Plain English](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/functional-programming-in-javascript-explained-in-plain-english/).

**Redux数据流管理架构有什么致命缺陷,未来会如何改进?**  
https://www.zhihu.com/question/277623017/answer/1517983092  
Redux最大的问题就是它本应该是一个小众的解决方案，硬生生被理论粉与名词流吹成了大众的最佳实践，因而带来了极为严重的理论与实践的gap。

**Slate 架构设计分析**  
https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/262209236  
slate 是一款流行的富文本编辑器——不，与其说它是一款编辑器，不如说它是一个编辑器框架，在这个框架上，开发者可以通过插件的形式提供丰富的富文本编辑功能。slate 比较知名的用户（包括前用户）有 GitBook 和语雀，具体可以查看官网的 products 页面。所谓“工欲善其事，必先利其器”，想要在项目中用好 slate，掌握其原理是一种事半功倍的做法。对于开发编辑器的同学来说，slate 的架构和技术选型也有不少值得学习的地方。这篇文章将会从以下几个方面探讨 slate。

An elegant solution to a tricky modern layout.

**Notes on the web, take 1**  
https://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2020/10/notes_on_the_we.html  
I decided to definitively solve the problem of notes on the web in the context of my Thidrekssaga side project. What I offer today is not that definitive solution, but just my first take. I’m looking for feedback. So let’s talk notes.

**Using dynamic imports and webpack to boost page load perfomance**  
https://blog.pusher.com/using-dynamic-imports-and-webpack-to-boost-page-load-perfomance/  
Recently, we’ve been overhauling the Pusher dashboard. It’s a rails app and the design had fallen behind recent branding evolutions our product website had made. The old front-end was Sass and jQuery modules compiled with sprockets. To bring it up to modern standards we started from scratch building out a new design system that would use a custom Tachyons build, a little postCSS and a sprinkling of ES6 modules all compiled with webpack.

**An Honest Review of Gatsby**  
https://cra.mr/an-honest-review-of-gatsby/  
I also want to note that while this blog post is primarily focusing on the flaws of Gatsby as a framework, I’m not here to tell you that it’s not good for your use case. That said, I was not able to discover many of these short comings easily when evaluating Gatsby, and many things you read on the internet don’t stem out of real-world usage. My hope here is that Gatsby continues to improve over time, and that, as a user, you can be more informed about if it’s the right choice for you.

**A web of trust for npm**  
https://www.btao.org/2020/10/02/npm-trust.html  
In 1984 the co-inventor of Unix, Ken Thompson, delivered a seminal speech in which he highlighted that you can’t trust code that you did not totally create yourself 1. For a while, this lesson was largely ignored as open-source package registries like RubyGems, PyPI and npm grew rapidly. However, as we’re seeing more and more supply-chain attacks through software dependencies, the risks of using unvetted dependencies are becoming clearer.

**Top 8 TypeScript ORMs, Query Builders, & Database Libraries: Evaluating Type Safety**  
https://www.prisma.io/dataguide/database-tools/evaluating-type-safety-in-the-top-8-typescript-orms  
Evaluating the level of type safety a TypeScript ORM provides out-of-the-box can be time consuming. This article briefly assesses the type safety of libraries considered in Top 11 Node.js ORMs, Query Builders & Database Libraries in 2020.

**How to Use Google Sheets as a Database (Responsibly)**  
https://dev.to/hacubu/how-to-use-google-sheets-as-a-database-responsibly-3ohk  
In this guide, I'll show you how to use Google Sheets as a database, complete with an API interface accessible over HTTP. We'll use Autocode, a Node.js API development platform and editor with built-in autocomplete, to deploy a simple app and handle Google's authentication process. I'll also explore the limitations of Google Sheets, including scalability, and where it makes sense to start looking at more complex alternatives.

**A Short Story About SQL’s Biggest Rival**  
https://www.holistics.io/blog/quel-vs-sql/  
A short story about SQL’s rival: Michael Stonebraker’s storied query language, [QUEL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QUEL_query_languages). Allegedly Oracle’s Larry Ellison said: “Maybe QUEL is better than SQL. Maybe French is better than English? It didn’t matter: English and SQL were going to win.”

**The Database is on Fire**  
http://acko.net/blog/the-database-is-on-fire/  
These days real-time databases are still mostly underused, and still regarded with suspicion. Most of them lean heavily into NoSQL style, which tend to bring up Mongo-fueled benders people would rather forget. For me though, it meant getting comfy on the CouchDB, as well as learning to design schemas that somebody other than a bureaucrat could correctly fill in. I think my time was better spent. The real topic of this post is what I'm using these days. Not by choice, but through uncaring and blindly applied corporate policy. Hence a Totally Fair and Unbiased comparison of two closely related Real-Time Database Products By Google.

**Nemo: Data discovery at Facebook**  
https://engineering.fb.com/data-infrastructure/nemo/  
As with any large organization, not all our data can be up-to-date simultaneously. By recognizing signals as to which artifacts should be used, Nemo also plays a role in maintaining code and data health. Proper ranking reduces the chance that an engineer might use outdated artifacts. Similar to the trend of direct answers in a browser search bar, Nemo is becoming more about intent and less about the raw search terminology over time. Nemo is already used by tens of thousands of engineers as part of their regular workflow, directing them to the information they need, and it will grow with us as we continue to grow. With Nemo, we have a scalable solution for the future.

**How Redis Simplifies Microservices Design Patterns**  
https://thenewstack.io/how-redis-simplifies-microservices-design-patterns/  
Microservice architecture can be a game-changer to beat the competition to market and reduce barriers for an organization’s cloud migration. With digital transformations well on their way, the motivation to re-platform as cloud native microservices will only grow. But like everything in life, microservices come with tradeoffs. Luckily, the pitfalls shared by early adopters and thought leaders on best practice design patterns are well documented. While this article only scratches the surface of awaiting challenges, my hope is that it empowers readers to identify patterns where they once saw chaos and reduces implementation complexity by using Redis beyond caching.

**What is DevOps? A guide to common methods and misconceptions**  
https://github.blog/2020-10-07-devops-definition/  
As part of GitHub’s Professional Services team, I’ve had the opportunity to see the way many companies have adopted DevOps and what it looks like for teams in their day-to-day work. Here’s what we’ve learned—and some common DevOps misconceptions we’ve encountered along the way. Related: [How to use DevOps to pay off your technical debt](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2020/10/05/tech-debt/).

**Play the long game when learning to code**  
https://stackoverflow.blog/2020/10/05/play-the-long-game-when-learning-to-code/  
Aspiring coders tend to take one of two types of learning approaches. The first involves trying to learn syntax as fast as possible. The second emphasizes understanding above all. It may take longer, but I hope to show how it's better in the end.

**Embedding Python in Go**  
https://poweruser.blog/embedding-python-in-go-338c0399f3d5  
Python can get embedded as a shared library into programs written in other languages. Here’s a trivial example for executing Python code in a Golang program and exchanging data between the two runtimes.

**We Hacked Apple for 3 Months: Here’s What We Found**  
https://samcurry.net/hacking-apple/  
During our engagement, we found a variety of vulnerabilities in core portions of their infrastructure that would've allowed an attacker to fully compromise both customer and employee applications, launch a worm capable of automatically taking over a victim's iCloud account, retrieve source code for internal Apple projects, fully compromise an industrial control warehouse software used by Apple, and take over the sessions of Apple employees with the capability of accessing management tools and sensitive resources.

**Chrome is deploying HTTP/3 and IETF QUIC**  
https://blog.chromium.org/2020/10/chrome-is-deploying-http3-and-ietf-quic.html  
We've found that IETF QUIC significantly outperforms HTTP over TLS 1.3 over TCP. In particular, Google search latency decreases by over 2%. YouTube rebuffer time decreased by over 9%, while client throughput increased by over 3% on desktop and over 7% on mobile. We're happy to announce that Chrome is rolling out support for IETF QUIC (specifically, draft version h3-29). Today 25% of Chrome Stable users are using h3-29, and we plan on increasing that number over the coming weeks as we continue to monitor performance data. Chrome will actively support both IETF QUIC h3-29 and Google QUIC Q050 to provide servers that support Q050 with time to update to IETF QUIC.

**Improving shared AR experiences with Cloud Anchors in ARCore 1.20**  
https://developers.googleblog.com/2020/10/improving-shared-ar-experiences-with.html  
As developers use Cloud Anchors to attach more AR experiences to the world, we also want to make it easier for people to discover them. That’s why we’re working on earth Cloud Anchors, a new feature that uses AR and global localization—the underlying technology that powers Live View features on Google Maps—to easily guide users to AR content.

**Announcing Swift Algorithms**  
https://swift.org/blog/swift-algorithms/  
I’m excited to announce Swift Algorithms, a new open-source package of sequence and collection algorithms, along with their related types. Algorithms are powerful tools for thought because they encapsulate difficult-to-read and error-prone raw loops. The Algorithms package includes a host of powerful, generic algorithms frequently found in other popular programming languages. We hope this new package will help people embrace algorithms, improving the correctness and performance of their code.

**GitHub Docs are now open source**  
https://github.blog/2020-10-07-github-docs-are-now-open-source/  
To make GitHub Docs the best they can be, we know we need to work in the open, with all of you, so that we can stay better in sync with your feedback, ideas, and collective knowledge. The best way to do that is to work in public. That’s why we’re open sourcing GitHub Docs, and opening it up to your feedback and contributions.

**Standard library for JavaScript and Node.js**  
stdlib (/ˈstændərd lɪb/ "standard lib") is a standard library for JavaScript and Node.js, with an emphasis on numerical and scientific computing applications. The library provides a collection of robust, high performance libraries for mathematics, statistics, data processing, streams, and more and includes many of the utilities you would expect from a standard library.

**Introducing DigitalOcean App Platform: reimagining PaaS to make it simpler for you to build, deploy, and scale apps**  
https://www.digitalocean.com/blog/introducing-digitalocean-app-platform-reimagining-paas-to-make-it-simpler-for-you-to-build-deploy-and-scale-apps  
A take on ‘reimagining’ Heroku-style PaaS (platform as a service). The idea is you point App Platform to a repo and they deploy it on their hardware. Supports Python, Node, Go, PHP, Ruby, and static sites out of the box, but Docker can also be used. Seems a wise move for DO as many developers continue to move away from wanting ‘boxes’ to more 'managed' deployments.

**curtains.js - easy WebGL tool to animate images and videos**  
https://www.curtainsjs.com/  
https://tympanus.net/codrops/2020/10/07/webgl-video-transitions-with-curtains-js/  
curtains.js was created with just that issue in mind. It is a small vanilla WebGL javascript library that converts HTML elements containing images, videos and canvases into 3D WebGL textured planes, allowing you to animate them via shaders. You can define each plane size and position via CSS, which makes it super easy to add WebGL responsive planes all over your pages. You can also add post processing effects to your scene to spice up the whole thing.

**The Best Design Is No Design**  
https://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2020/10/the-best-design-is-no-design.php  
One characteristic of good UX design is that it’s unnoticeable to users because it reflects the way they work. As many companies scale up—especially growing startups—they struggle to add value without adding complexity. This is one reason we’re seeing a trend toward adding secondary navigation at the left of many applications. Often, one horizontal navigation bar across the top of an application is just not scalable. Your focus should be on simplicity. The main question you need to ask yourself when considering your user-interface design is how you can help your application scale. How can a company grow their offering while keeping the spirit of an intuitive product alive? Releated: [What is Simplicity Theory? Why people prefer simple experiences](https://uxmag.com/articles/what-is-simplicity-theory-why-people-prefer-simple-experiences).

**Compelling and Moving – A Guide to Motion Design Principles**  
https://www.toptal.com/designers/ux/motion-design-principles  
In theory, making UI elements move is easy. Define points on a predetermined path, and software tweens the gaps. In reality, it doesn’t work that way. Tools and techniques are essential, but they derive their power from principles. If motion is to enhance the usability of digital products, it must be founded on unchanging rules of behavior that apply to an infinite number of use cases.
