**The end of the Redis adventure**  
http://antirez.com/news/133

https://redislabs.com/blog/redis-core-team-update/  
So, dear Redis community, today I’m stepping back as the Redis maintainer. My new position will be, on one side, an “ideas” person at Redis Labs, in order to provide inputs for new Redis possibilities: I’ll continue to be part of the Redis Labs advisory board. On the other hand however my hands will be free, and I’ll do something else, that could be writing code or not, who knows, I don’t want to make plans for now. However I’m very skeptical about me not writing more code in the future. It’s just too much fun :D. 另附：[Linus Torvalds: 'I Do No Coding Any More'](https://linux.slashdot.org/story/20/07/03/2133201/linus-torvalds-i-do-no-coding-any-more).

**Holographic optics for thin and lightweight virtual reality**  
https://research.fb.com/blog/2020/06/holographic-optics-for-thin-and-lightweight-virtual-reality/  
Facebook Reality Labs (FRL) is always exploring new optical architectures to improve form factor, comfort, and optical performance. Last fall, at Oculus Connect 6, FRL Chief Scientist Michael Abrash introduced new miniaturization progress in VR with Half Dome 2 and 3, two prototypes that examine how varifocal displays can improve visual and physical comfort. This year, at the virtual SIGGRAPH conference, we’re presenting another research milestone on this path: a new optical architecture that is significantly more compact and offers the potential for better visual performance.

**如何为团队定制自己的 Node.js 框架？**  
https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/154643011  
为什么需要定制自己的框架？直接用 Koa，Egg 不香么？如果有多个项目呢？插件和中间件都需要重新配置么？也许有同学会说，可以把这些封装为一个骨架，需要的时候一键生成新项目。那如果骨架升级了，如何把旧项目升级呢？一两个还好说，如果十几个，甚至上百个呢？如果你的团队需要：统一的技术选型，比如数据库、模板、前端框架及各种中间件设施都需要选型，而框架封装后保证应用使用一套架构；统一的默认配置，开源社区的配置可能不适用于公司，而又不希望应用去配置；统一的部署方案，通过框架和平台的双向控制，应用只需要关注自己的代码；统一的代码风格，框架不仅仅解决代码重用问题，还可以对应用做一定约束，并定制适合团队的目录加载规范。下面，我们来一起基于 Egg 定制一个独属于我们的 鸭蛋框架（yadan）。另附：[如何为团队量身定制 EggJS 目录挂载规范？](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/153322661)。

**2020-2021 设计趋势ISUX报告 · 用户体验篇**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/1g8IBKzjhE6a8gVRol7tJQ  
未来的用户体验会出现什么新趋势？人工智能等算法的发展、5G技术普及、新的智能设备形态、新的信息处理技术、新一代用户的喜好和口味......这些往后或将影响用户体验发展的走向。未来用户对体验的要求只会越来越高。用户体验设计师需要了解更多的技术动向，但安身立命之本还是让用户真正受益：立足于用户真实的使用场景，在理性价值层面上，打造可用、易用、高效的设计；在感性需求层上赋予情感上的愉悦性，在反思层面赋予意义价值。

**Building Domain Driven Microservices**  
https://medium.com/walmartlabs/building-domain-driven-microservices-af688aa1b1b8  
In this blog, we touched upon various concepts, strategies, and design heuristics to consider when we venture into the world of microservices, more specifically when we try to break a monolith into multiple domain-based microservices. Many of these are vast topics on their own, and I don’t think we’ve done enough justice to explain them in full detail, but we wanted to introduce some of the critical topics and our experience in adopting these. Further Reading (link) section has some references and some useful content for anyone who wishes to pursue this path.

**Vue 3: mid 2020 status update**  
https://github.com/vuejs/rfcs/issues/183  
Many of our users have been asking this question: when will Vue 3 be ready? We have refrained from giving a definitive answer because predicting software delivery time is hardly ever accurate. As a non-profit-driven project, we wanted to focus on writing good software instead of hitting deadlines. However, it's been a long wait, and we know the uncertainty can make it difficult to make plans with Vue 3. So here we would like to provide some general guidance and detailed status updates to help our users adjust their expectations and plans accordingly.

**An in-depth beginner's guide to testing React applications**  
https://jkettmann.com/beginners-guide-to-testing-react/  
The goal of this blog post is to act as a guide for your first tests. We'll take a small application as an example and cover it with tests. We will discuss what we should test and why we should test it. We will see different techniques that can help us to write tests with confidence without relying on trial and error. 另附：[How To Test Your React Apps With The React Testing Library](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/07/react-apps-testing-library/)、[Writing Tests that Work](https://www.sitepen.com/blog/writing-tests-that-work/).

**7 岁的 ECharts 为你送上不止一份生日礼物……**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/DCibruls1ANGW0if13ijVw  
七年前的今天，ECharts 1.0 发布并正式在 GitHub 上开源。七年，经过上百维护者的用心打磨，ECharts 已经走到了 4.8.0 版本。七岁，对于一个娃娃来说，正是告别幼稚、开启高速学习模式的重要年龄。对于 ECharts 而言，也是一个逐渐在开源生态中摸索出可持续发展模式的重要阶段。ECharts 过去一年发展中，最大的收获是我们有了更多的小伙伴加入到 ECharts 的开源共建生态中，我们的社区规模发展迅速。

**给自己找个导师**  
https://www.yuque.com/barretlee/thinking/unouq3  
什么是 mentor，可以简单地理解成引路人、导师，一般这个人在综合能力和视野上比你优秀一些，他可以在你职业发展之路上提供有用的建议和帮助。事实上，我在阿里这几年，也在不断地为自己找 mentor，甚至也会尝试成为他人的 mentor，最近思考了一下，感觉整个操作还是不太规范化，缺乏更多的有效性。

**月影：前端越更新我越兴奋，未来重点趋势有这些**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/mt3eKTCCi7i69XPphCfMug

**CSS变量对JS交互组件开发带来的提升与变革**  
https://www.zhangxinxu.com/wordpress/2020/07/css-var-improve-components/  
CSS变量带来的提升绝不仅仅是节约点CSS代码，以及降低CSS开发和维护成本。更重要的是，把组件中众多的交互开发从原来的JS转移到了CSS代码中，让组件代码更简洁，同时让视觉表现实现更加灵活了。我们通过几个案例来说明这一变化。

**万字长文给“DNS”带绿帽**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/kadxPdIuPgq_sc3F-APBIg  
还记得面试过程中被问了千百遍的"输入URL后发生了什么"这个经典问题吗？因为这个问题覆盖了太多的知识点，其中包括计算机网络，操作系统，数据结构等一些列问题，对于面试官和面试者来说都更方便后续面试的进展。想必很多小伙伴都做过web开发，或多或少都会和各种浏览器联系在一起，最终做测试的时候也会使用多种浏览器测试以保证能很好地兼容。那么现在我们先从Chrome浏览器说起。

**计时攻击 Timing Attacks**  
https://coolshell.cn/articles/21003.html  
本文来自读者“程序猿石头”的投稿文章《这 10 行比较字符串相等的代码给我整懵了，不信你也来看看》，原文写的很好，但不够直接了当，信息密度不够高，所以我对原文进行大量的删减、裁剪、改写和添加，主要删除了一些没有信息的段落，主要加入了如何实施计时攻击相关的其它内容，让这篇文章中的知识更系统一些，并且还指出了其它的一些问题。所以，我把标题也改成了《计时攻击 Timing Attacks》。

**Behind the scenes of a web dev blog redesign**  
https://areknawo.com/behind-the-scenes-of-a-web-dev-blog-redesign/  
If you're a frequent visitor of this blog, you might have noticed that it went through a little redesign recently. Because I've seen people asking about and commenting on the design of this website (at least the old one), I thought that with this redesign, it's time to go a little behind the scenes on how this website operates and what's the design and thinking process behind it.

**Differences Between Static Generated Sites And Server-Side Rendered Apps**  
https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/07/differences-static-generated-sites-server-side-rendered-apps/  
Statically generated sites or pre-rendering and server-side rendered applications are two modern ways to build front-end applications using JavaScript frameworks. These two modes, yet different, are often mixed up as the same thing and in this tutorial, we’re going to learn about the differences between them.

**A look at the Gemini protocol: a brutally simple alternative to the web**  
https://toffelblog.xyz/blog/gemini-overview/  
[Gemini](https://gemini.circumlunar.space/) is a new, collaboratively designed internet protocol, which explores the space inbetween gopher and the web, striving to address (perceived) limitations of one while avoiding the (undeniable) pitfalls of the other. This server hosts the official specification and other documentation for Gemini, as well as offering free personal Geminispace (managed via sftp) for those wanting to play with the protocol. The vast majority of this content is served via Gemini itself, so you'll need a suitable client to access it.

**Announcing Redis as a Code! Lambda Store Terraform Provider**  
https://medium.com/lambda-store/announcing-redis-as-a-code-lambda-store-terraform-provider-c2a481cad591  
2 months ago we have launched first [Serverless Redis](https://lambda.store/) and made announcement. After launching our product, we got incredibly huge interest and user feedback from different platforms. In hackernews, lambda store post was trend topic for a while. We have collected all user feedbacks from different platforms and realised that the community is asking for developer api and automation tools. Last month we have released our developer api.

**How Did Vim Become So Popular**  
https://pragmaticpineapple.com/how-did-vim-become-so-popular/  
If we look at the StackOverflow survey for 2019 about the most popular development environments, Vim is still there on the 5th place, with around 25% of Web Developers using it. Fifth place is pretty neat considering the first Vim release happened almost 30 years ago (yeah, you read that right, Vim got first released in 1991). To better understand why and how Vim got (and is) so popular, it is best to look into the roots of how it all started. Before vim, there was vi, before vi there was ed. What are all these two or three letter words, and what is the story behind it? Let us dive in and figure out.

**Information And Information Architecture: The BIG Picture**  
https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/07/information-architecture-big-picture/  
Information architecture is the process of categorizing and organizing information to create structure and meaning. To give this context, this article explores not only the basics of information architecture, but also the broader view of the information age, how we use information and how it impacts our world and our lives. Understanding the bigger picture enables us to get a much clearer perception of the value that good information architecture delivers to help our information-overloaded lives.

**life is 90% of my use cases for org-mode**  
http://stormrider.io/ninety-pct.html  
When I encountered a system where plain text is the raw material flowing through the pipes, I was hooked. This led me to undertake an informal study of Unix, all the way back to the Tech Model Railroad Club and all the hackers that came from there. But what I really learned was that the rules of Unix could be adapted to life. After about 30 years as a tech writer and frequent programmer, I finally settled on a set that works for me. Little did I know that these very principles would lead me to org-mode, which would later lead me to find my people.
