**Design Doc: Use JavaScript instead of TypeScript for internal Deno Code**  
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_WvwHl7BXUPmoiSeD8G83JmS8ypsTPqed4Btkqkn_-4/preview  
Deno should be focused on providing its users with a performant and safe runtime environment. The organization of Deno's internal code should never come at a cost to the product it delivers. Currently we are attempting to "self host", in that we organize our internal TS code just like Deno user code would look. This is a nice thing, but it's not necessary. It's becoming more and more obvious that our attempts to "self host" are hindering the performance of user code and the maintainability of the runtime.

**Playing Around With The Fuchsia Operating System**  
https://blog.quarkslab.com/playing-around-with-the-fuchsia-operating-system.html  
Fuchsia is a new operating system developed by Google, targeting the AArch64 and x86_64 architectures. While little is known about the purpose of this OS and where it will be used, it seems plausible that it aims at replacing Android on smartphones and Chrome OS on laptops. In the interest of acquiring knowledge on an OS that could possibly run on millions of devices in the future, we decided to give a quick look at Fuchsia, learn about its inner design, security properties, strengths and weaknesses, and find ways to attack it.

**The Mad Magazine Fold-In Effect in CSS**  
https://thomaspark.co/2020/06/the-mad-magazine-fold-in-effect-in-css/  
Of course I had to create the paper folding effect for the web. There’s many different ways to achieve this, but this approach is nice because: It’s CSS only, relying on no JavaScript. Uses a single image instead of requiring the image to be sliced up in Photoshop. Can be configured with just HTML by setting CSS variables in a style attribute.

**A Beginner’s Guide to the GraphQL Ecosystem**  
https://retool.com/blog/a-beginners-guide-to-the-graphql-ecosystem/  
If you’re building for the web, you’re probably spending a good chunk of your time working with REST APIs (or SOAP, if you’re really unlucky). The REST spec hasn’t changed much over the past two decades, but GraphQL has been stirring the pot. GraphQL is a query language for working with your data – built on top of your existing APIs – and it continues to rise in popularity since its open source release in 2015 because it makes building your app a lot easier. 另附：[XgeneCloud - Instantly generate REST & GraphQL APIs on any Database](https://github.com/xgenecloud/xgenecloud).

**Speeding up a Git monorepo at Dropbox with <200 lines of code**  
https://dropbox.tech/application/speeding-up-a-git-monorepo-at-dropbox-with--200-lines-of-code  
We migrated from Mercurial to Git in 2014 to improve local performance and began consolidating our repositories that hosted our backend code. But as this monorepo grew, we experienced Git performance issues that grew linearly with the number of files we added. Inconveniently, this problem was the most severe on macOS—the platform most of our engineers work on. Fortunately, between upstream improvements in Git itself and a small wrapper of custom code, we’ve been able to speed Git operations up without fragmenting our unified and growing repository.

**The rise of the DevOps mindset**  
https://stackoverflow.blog/2020/06/10/the-rise-of-the-devops-mindset/  
DevOps has become one of those buzzwords with many conflicting definitions. What’s for certain is it’s on the rise. In our 2020 developer Survey, around 80% of the respondents believed that DevOps is at least somewhat important. We take a look at the phenomenon, some definitions, and talk to our engineers about some of the…

**UtahFS: Encrypted File Storage**  
https://blog.cloudflare.com/utahfs/  
Encryption is one of the most powerful technologies that everyone uses on a daily basis without realizing it.  So I set out to build such a system! The end result is called UtahFS, and the code for it is available here. Keep in mind that this system is not used in production at Cloudflare: it’s a proof-of-concept that I built while working on our Research Team. The rest of this blog post describes why I built it as I did, but there’s documentation in the repository on actually using it if you want to skip to that.

**Prisma 2.0: Confidence and productivity for your database**  
https://www.prisma.io/blog/announcing-prisma-2-n0v98rzc8br1  
Accessing databases in Node.js and TypeScript can feel brittle and painful. Prisma removes the pain with an auto-generated and type-safe query builder that's tailored to your data! 

**Most tech content is bullshit**  
https://www.aleksandra.codes/tech-content-consumer  
This pattern is consuming — instead of creating. Consuming — without questioning. Consuming and hiding behind an authority. I saw developers taking other people's solutions for granted. Not thinking twice about the approach, not bothering about analyzing it. Ok, when this is Dan Abramov telling you how to use React or documentation saying that this is the only way to use its API, then yes, you probably should agree with it. Yet, when you're using some tech content without at least a bit of skepticism, then well, you still might go far in your career, but it also may hold you back.

**Create diagrams with code using Graphviz**  
https://ncona.com/2020/06/create-diagrams-with-code-using-graphviz/  
In this post we learned how we can use Graphviz to generate graphs based on a declarative language. This has made it a lot easier for me to draw architecture diagrams and modify them in the future. I presented the features that I consider most important for everyday use, but there are a good amount of features that I didn’t cover and frankly, I don’t understand.

**Teaching My MIT Classes with Only Free/Libre Software**  
https://www.gnu.org/education/teaching-my-mit-classes-with-only-free-libre-software.en.html  
This spring (2020) MIT moved all its classes online because of the COVID-19 pandemic. It made available licenses for various nonfree programs, but I objected to them on grounds of principle. For my class, an advanced class in computer programming, I made arrangements to avoid suggesting any nonfree software to my students. Instead, I used an installation of BigBlueButton running on a server owned by the Free Software Foundation. Rubén Rodriguez of the FSF helped get this and other software working. 

**Extracting Structured Data from Templatic Documents**  
https://ai.googleblog.com/2020/06/extracting-structured-data-from.html  
In “Representation Learning for Information Extraction from Form-like Documents”, accepted to ACL 2020, we present an approach to automatically extract structured data from templatic documents. In contrast to previous work on extraction from plain-text documents, we propose an approach that uses knowledge of target field types to identify candidate fields. These are then scored using a neural network that learns a dense representation of each candidate using the words in its neighborhood. Experiments on two corpora (invoices and receipts) show that we’re able to generalize well to unseen layouts. 另附：[Recent Advances in Google Translate](https://ai.googleblog.com/2020/06/recent-advances-in-google-translate.html).

https://hackernoon.com/how-wikipedia-lost-3-billion-organic-search-visits-to-google-in-2019-qz6630u6  
In 2015, Google was able to steal over 550 million clicks from Wikipedia in six months, and here we are five years later watching that trend accelerate at breakneck speed. While many factors are contributing to that decrease, the vast majority of Wikipedia’s traffic has been lost to Google’s zero click results, emphasizing just how much power Google has over search traffic.

**Biohacking Lite**  
https://karpathy.github.io/2020/06/11/biohacking-lite/  
Throughout my life I never paid too much attention to health, exercise, diet or nutrition. I knew that you’re supposed to get some exercise and eat vegetables or something, but it stopped at that (“mom said”-) level of abstraction. I also knew that I can probably get away with some ignorance while I am young, but at some point I was messing with my health-adjusted life expectancy. So about halfway through 2019 I resolved to spend some time studying these topics in greater detail and dip my toes into some biohacking. And now… it’s been a year! For this post I wanted to focus on some of my experiments around weight loss because 1) weight is very easy to measure and 2) the biochemistry of it is interesting.
