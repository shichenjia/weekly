**VUE v3.0.0 One Piece**  
https://github.com/vuejs/vue-next/releases/tag/v3.0.0  
We are proud to announce the official release of Vue.js 3.0 "One Piece". This new major version of the framework provides improved performance, smaller bundle sizes, better TypeScript integration, new APIs for tackling large scale use cases, and a solid foundation for long-term future iterations of the framework.

**We now consider Moment.js to be a legacy project in maintenance mode**  
https://momentjs.com/docs/#/-project-status/  
It is not dead, but it is indeed done. In practice, this means: We will not be adding new features or capabilities; We will not be changing Moment's API to be immutable; We will not be addressing tree shaking or bundle size issues; We will not be making any major changes (no version 3); We may choose to not fix bugs or behavioral quirks, especially if they are long-standing known issues. Releated: [Luxon - A powerful, modern, and friendly wrapper for Javascript dates and times](https://moment.github.io/luxon/).

**GitHub CLI 1.0 is now available**  
https://github.blog/2020-09-17-github-cli-1-0-is-now-available/  
With GitHub CLI 1.0, you can: Run your entire GitHub workflow from the terminal, from issues through releases; Call the GitHub API to script nearly any action, and set a custom alias for any command; Connect to GitHub Enterprise Server in addition to GitHub.com. And As a bonus, it’s [cross platform and built in Go](https://github.com/cli/cli).

**Disrespectful Design—Users aren’t stupid or lazy**  
https://somehowmanage.com/2020/09/13/disrespectful-design-users-arent-stupid-or-lazy/  
It’s a common narrative in tech to design products with the assumption that users are stupid and lazy. I think that is both disrespectful and wrong. The idea is rooted in a lot of research around product usability, but it has been bastardized. Thing of it as a perversion of the Don’t Make Me Think thesis.

**Tools should not only be for experts – they should turn us into them**  
https://christianheilmann.com/2020/09/15/tools-should-not-only-be-for-experts-they-should-turn-us-into-them/  
I think it is high time we moved away from the concept of “tools for experts” towards one of “using this tool over time makes you an expert”. To put it in other words: Our tools should never make people feel “too stupid” to use them or wonder why some features are even there. As an example, let’s take a look at the developer tools bundled with browsers these days. These are excellent. It is wonderful to have all you need to build and test your web products in the tool you use to surf the web.

**The History of Web Search**  
https://css-tricks.com/chapter-4-search/  
If not for Stanford University, web search may have been lost. It is the birthplace of Yahoo!, Google and Excite. It ran the servers that ran the code that ran the first search engines. The founders of both Yahoo! and Google are alumni. But many of the most prominent players in search were not in the computer science department. They were in the symbolic systems program.

**How HTTPS works ...in a comic!**  
https://howhttps.works/  
Have you ever wondered why a green lock icon appears on your browser URL bar? And why is it important? We did too, and this comic is for you! Follow the adventures of Certificat, Browserbird, and Compugter as they explain why HTTPS is crucial for the future of the web and how it all works together. Don't let the bad crabs get you (you'll know what we mean in the comic). Get to know HTTPS and why it is essential to your privacy.

**The Ugly Side of React Hooks**  
https://medium.com/swlh/the-ugly-side-of-hooks-584f0f8136b6  
In this post, I will share my own point of view about React Hooks, and as the title of this post implies, I am not a big fan. Let’s break down the motivation for ditching classes in favor of hooks, as described in the official React’s docs.

**Rewriting Facebook's "Recoil" React library from scratch in 100 lines**  
https://bennetthardwick.com/blog/recoil-js-clone-from-scratch-in-100-lines/  
Recoil is a slick new React library written by some people at Facebook that work on a tool called “Comparison View." It came about because of ergonomics and performance issues with context and useState. It’s a very clever library, and almost everyone will find a use for it - check out this explainer video if you want to learn more. At first I was really taken aback by the talk of graph theory and the wondrous magic that Recoil performs, but after a while I started to see that maybe it’s not that special after all. Here’s my shot at implementing something similar! Releated: [

**Angular Thoughts on Docs**  
https://blog.angular.io/angular-thoughts-on-docs-74dd343039c0  
If you have visited the docs at angular.io lately, you might have noticed some changes in our content layout and structure. As the lead technical writer for Angular, I thought I’d take a moment to cover some of the main goals we have for making the Angular documentation experience the best experience possible.

**Understanding the Event Loop, Callbacks, Promises, and Async/Await in JavaScript**  
https://www.taniarascia.com/asynchronous-javascript-event-loop-callbacks-promises-async-await/  
Because Web APIs often provide data asynchronously, learning how to handle the result of asynchronous actions is an essential part of being a JavaScript developer. In this article, you learned how the host environment uses the event loop to handle the order of execution of code with the stack and queue. You also tried out examples of three ways to handle the success or failure of an asynchronous event, with callbacks, promises, and async/await syntax. Finally, you used the Fetch Web API to handle asynchronous actions.

**Dan Shaw – What I didn’t do and why. A Node Story.**  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Kjp7d-P-kk  
Join Dan Shaw for a journey through the past decade to the ubiquity of Node.js today. Dan, better known as dshaw, is not the creator of node, he’s not even a well known module developer, but still he’s one of the best known voices in Node.js. Dan is a developer, a community organizer, and entrepreneur. Known as The Godfather of Node.js. Dan founded The Node Firm, then NodeSource, and helped land Node.js in the Node.js Foundation. OSI layer 8 shit. We’ll look back at how we got here, explore how and why we made some of the big decisions along the way, and what we can do to make sure Node.js stays true to its community roots.

**Weaved Webs**  
https://css-tricks.com/weaved-webs/  
There is a bit of an irony with [Jamstack](https://jamstack.org/). The concept is simple: you put pre-rendered, static files on web hosting (a CDN) designed to do that well. That’s it. If you need to do more, anything you do from there is done with client-side JavaScript, which is likely talking to serverless functions because that’s the spiritual partner to Jamstack on the back end.

**ServerlessDays Warsaw 2020**  
https://www.youtube.com/playlist?reload=9&list=PLp4wchugWzHu2QIo2hQh4wfYqIGgYYFcb

**Throughput autoscaling: Dynamic sizing for Facebook.com**  
https://engineering.fb.com/networking-traffic/throughput-autoscaling/  
The autoscaling methodology in Facebook enables us to correctly and safely size our services without compromising reliability. After we proved its functionality using web tier for a year, we started to apply it to other large services, such as Django web service for Instagram and multifeed services. We are in the process of deploying autoscaling to a broader set of Facebook web and Instagram back-end services that show a diurnal demand pattern. As more servers are released into the elastic compute pool, we will have a bigger opportunity to identify workloads that can move from having dedicated capacity available to them all the time to running on the elastic compute pool. 

**The software engineering lifecycle: How we built the new Dropbox Plus**  
https://dropbox.tech/frontend/the-software-engineering-lifecycle--how-we-built-the-new-dropbox  
A few weeks ago, we released a whole bunch of new features to Dropbox Plus, our paid plan for personal users. While we started as a storage company, we‘ve grown to be a hub to manage your digital life. About 150 people worked on this launch: engineers, product managers, designers, copywriters, and many more. In this post I’ll distill my experience working on different parts of the launch, and discuss how we think about building software. I’ll go into a few technical details, but mostly focus on how teams organize and operate.

**What we learned after a year of GitLab.com on Kubernetes**

It's been one year since we moved GitLab.com to Kubernetes. We unpack the challenges and learnings from this major migration.

**High Efficiency Tool Platform for Framework Migration**  
https://tech.ebayinc.com/engineering/high-efficiency-tool-platform-for-framework-migration/  
The eBay framework team has implemented a brand new tooling platform to speed up framework level migration. It supports highly efficient migration of applications running on legacy stacks to new platforms. This has been proven by the success stories migrating Batch, SOA, Trading/Shopping API, and messaging application migration.

**An introduction to Data Oriented Design with Rust**  
https://jamesmcm.github.io/blog/2020/07/25/intro-dod/  
Data-oriented design is an approach to optimising programs by carefully considering the memory layout of data structures, and their implications for auto-vectorisation and use of the CPU cache. I highly recommend watching Mike Acton’s “Data-Oriented Design and C++” talk if you haven’t seen it already.

**A database for every repl**  
https://blog.repl.it/database  
Repl.it is already the best place to build your apps. But there was a missing piece: where do you store your data? We’re introducing Repl.it Database: a fast, free, and easy key-value store that’s built into every repl. All you have to do is import one of our packages for Python, Node.js, or Go, and you can instantly start setting keys in your database.

**Old, Good Database Design**  
https://relinx.io/2020/09/14/old-good-database-design/  
This is achieved with a help of robust and well-thought database design. Of course, business logic is coded in the application layer and it makes sure data is in a proper format before arriving at the database. But who guarantees that a network failure or a bug will not allow corrupted “guests”? Also, the application layer is not the only “door” to the database. We can have import scripts, maintenance scripts, and mere mortal DBAs and developers interacting with it. Having preventive measures at a very low level ensures our data is always checked before stored.

**The future of .NET Standard**  
https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/the-future-of-net-standard/  
.NET 5 will be a single product with a uniform set of capabilities and APIs that can be used for Windows desktop apps, cross-platform mobile apps, console apps, cloud services, and websites.

**Panic - Nova**  
https://nova.app/  
If we're being honest, Mac apps are a bit of a lost art. There are great reasons to make cross-platform apps — to start, they're cross-platform — but it's just not who we are. Founded as a Mac software company in 1997, our joy at Panic comes from building things that feel truly, well, Mac-like. Long ago, we created Coda, an all-in-one Mac web editor that broke new ground. But when we started work on Nova, we looked at where the web was today, and where we needed to be. It was time for a fresh start.

From my experience with using Git myself and teaching others, a better way to improve your effectiveness with Git is by understanding how it works behind the scenes and not by learning more "advanced" Git commands. This understanding is what will allow you to solve the kind of problems that multi-user collaborative coding sometimes produce.

很难界定千禧一代(生于20世纪80年代至2000年初)和 z 世代(生于1995年以后) ，但那些已成为当前消费市场中心的人与上一代有着不同的价值观和文化品味。他们表现出的消费特征是强调个人幸福而非群体，分享而非持有，体验而非产品。不仅仅是购买东西，他们倾向于通过购买包含社会价值观和信息的东西来表达自己的信念，他们也喜欢展示自己的成功或财富，并且乐于投资昂贵的奢侈品。与老一辈为了一个遥远的未来而牺牲了现在不同，他们关注的是现在。
