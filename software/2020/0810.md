## 本期看点

**技术管理的世界观**  
https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/166099294  
这篇文章中的讨论主要适用于“通过技术实现业务(或产品)，然后通过业务盈利”这种类型的组织中。对于直接出售技术盈利、或者将技术外包类型的组织，部分结论可能不适用，但仍可借鉴其中的思路。这篇文章不是对传统管理学的书摘总结。我发现大部分的教材或者经典书籍都是直接站在结论的角度来讲述的，而我更希望得到的是方法。例如管理学中常以“组织”、“角色”、“计划”、“控制”四个维度来组织内容，我并不想要直接要其中的结论，而是更想知道为什么以这四个维度来思考，背后的依据是什么，会不会在不同情况下要增加新的维度。

**语雀的技术架构演进之路**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/VM61gkZuYYqE4pVhpba3nQ  
每个技术人心中或多或少都有一个「产品梦」，好的技术需要搭配好的产品，才能让用户爱不释手，尤其是做一款知识服务型产品。本文从技术架构的视角，回顾了语雀的原型、内部服务和对外商业化的全过程，并对函数计算在语雀架构演进过程中所扮演的角色做了详细的介绍。

**The UX of LEGO Interface Panels – George Cave**  
https://www.designedbycave.co.uk/2020/LEGO-Interface-UX/  
Piloting an ocean exploration ship or Martian research shuttle is serious business. Let’s hope the control panel is up to scratch. Two studs wide and angled at 45°, the ubiquitous “2x2 decorated slope” is a LEGO minifigure’s interface to the world. These iconic, low-resolution designs are the perfect tool to learn the basics of physical interface design. Armed with 52 different bricks, let’s see what they can teach us about the design, layout and organisation of complex interfaces. Welcome to the world of LEGO UX design.

**Patterns of Distributed Systems**  
https://martinfowler.com/articles/patterns-of-distributed-systems/  
Distributed systems provide a particular challenge to program. They often require us to have multiple copies of data, which need to keep synchronized. Yet we cannot rely on processing nodes working reliably, and network delays can easily lead to inconsistencies. Despite this, many organizations rely on a range of core distributed software handling data storage, messaging, system management, and compute capability. These systems face common problems which they solve with similar solutions. This article recognizes and develops these solutions as patterns, with which we can build up an understanding of how to better understand, communicate and teach distributed system design.

**The key components for building a React community**  
https://stackoverflow.blog/2020/08/06/the-key-components-for-building-a-react-community/  
The React community grew organically thanks to its instant popularity. Here's how the folks shepherding that community ensure that everyone who wants to contribute is welcome to.

**Production Loading Performance 10 Years Later**  
https://openjsf.org/blog/2020/08/05/production-loading-performance-10-years-later/  
Nicole Sullivan, Product Manager for Chrome at Google, recently hosted an informative keynote presentation with Google software engineer Shubhie Panicker on production loading performance during OpenJS World. Their collaboration in this area spans over 10 years, and the presentation begins with a look back at loading performance issues and then opens into how steps are being taken to improve performance currently.

Interop between them is possible, but it’s a hassle.

**1Keys – How I Made a Piano in only 1kb of JavaScript**  
https://frankforce.com/?p=7617#pianostory  
The legendary JavaScript competition JS1k was thought to have ended, but it has risen from it’s ashes in the form of [JS1024](https://js1024.fun/)! This competition for making tiny JavaScript programs has been going on for 10 years and will now be continuing under a new name. Thank you to the organizers and other participants, you should definitely check out some of the other entries. In this post I will go through every single line of my 1 kilobyte piano and explain how some of the trickier parts work.

**折叠屏手机，会给交互设计和前端开发带来什么改变**  
https://www.zhihu.com/question/313619328/answer/1391436635  
可折叠设备形式多样，从笔记本电脑到手机，再到新奇的双屏幕混合设备。对于这类新发明并没有一个全面的定义，但大多数都可以归为两类。“可折叠”是指屏幕可以折叠的设备（比如华为Mate X，三星Galaxy Z Flip）；而“双屏”设备的屏幕是分开的，但也可以以独特的方式一起工作，以灵活的形式提供生产力（比如，微软的Surface Neo和Surface Duo）。当涉及到Web设计时，这两种类型可能会遵循类似的规则。如果这项技术能大获成功，那么Web设计将面临十年来最大的变革。这对于我们Web开发者而言，也将会开启新的旅程。

关于性能、SPA、客户端渲染的讨论。

**Preload late-discovered Hero images faster**  
https://addyosmani.com/blog/preload-hero-images/  
Preload allows you to inform the browser about critical resources you want to load as soon as possible, prior to them being found in HTML. If you are optimizing Largest Contentful Paint (LCP), preload can be a game-changer for boosting download priority of late-discovered Hero images and resources, loaded via JavaScript.

**Bringing darkness to the BBC Sounds mobile apps**  
https://medium.com/bbc-design-engineering/bringing-darkness-to-the-bbc-sounds-mobile-apps-f4ece0694c50  
Then, along with the release of Android 10 and iOS 12 in Autumn 2019 came standardised OS level support for dark mode. This was very exciting news for us app developers. Every other Friday, we get 10% time — an opportunity for the whole team to expand our coding horizons and play around with new technologies. We used our next available 10% time slot to investigate the new dark mode APIs.

**Tailwind CSS: From Side-Project Byproduct to Multi-Million Dollar Business**  
https://adamwathan.me/tailwindcss-from-side-project-byproduct-to-multi-mullion-dollar-business/  
We're also about to cross $2 million in revenue from Tailwind UI, our first commercial Tailwind CSS product which was released about 5 months ago — a bit under two years after the very first Tailwind CSS release. Here’s the story from the beginning, while it’s still fresh enough to remember…

**Reviewing the worst piece of code ever**  
https://www.micheleriva.it/posts/2020-07-31-reviewing-the-worst-piece-of-code-ever  
There’s an italian Facebook page called “Il Programmatore di Merda” (which can be translated to “The Shitty Programmer”). I love that page. They often share shitty pieces of code and memes about programming, but today I’ve seen something quite incredible.

**Let's Debug a Node.js Application**  
https://blog.heroku.com/debug-node-applications  
There are always challenges when it comes to debugging applications. Node.js' asynchronous workflows add an extra layer of complexity to this arduous process. Although there have been some updates made to the V8 engine in order to easily access asynchronous stack traces, most of the time, we just get errors on the main thread of our applications, which makes debugging a little bit difficult. As well, when our Node.js applications crash, we usually need to rely on some complicated CLI tooling to analyze the core dumps. In this article, we'll take a look at some easier ways to debug your Node.js applications.

**Broccoli: Syncing faster by syncing less**  
https://dropbox.tech/infrastructure/-broccoli--syncing-faster-by-syncing-less  
We will dive into the Broccoli encoding, provide an overview of the block sync protocol, and explain how we are using them in conjunction to optimize block data transfers. All together, these improvements have reduced median latencies by more than 30% and decreased data on the wire by the same amount. We will talk about the principles we kept in mind and what we have learned along the way. We will also touch upon how our new investments can help us in the future. 

**20 YEARS OF EDGE COMPUTING**  
https://blogs.akamai.com/2020/08/20-years-of-edge-computing.html  
Edge computing is not a new idea, just one that for decades was ahead of the market's ability to fully appreciate it. High-speed trading or optimizing and localizing services at branch offices are two long-standing examples of pushing business logic closer to where the action is. Modern technology adds use cases including enabling faster decisions for connected cars and other IoT devices or improving network processing speeds with 5G. 

**Making magic: Reimagining Developer Experience for the World of Serverless**  
https://blog.cloudflare.com/making-magic-reimagining-developer-experiences-for-the-world-of-serverless/  
In building what we believe to be the serverless platform of the future — a promise that feels very magical —  we wanted to bring back that magical feeling to every step of the development journey. If serverless is about empowering developers, then they should be empowered every step of the way: from proof of concept to MVP and beyond. We’re excited to share with you today our approach to making our developer experience delightful. 另附：[Introducing Cloudflare Network Interconnect](https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-network-interconnect/ )

**Think and Develop Serverless Applications as ‘Set-Pieces’**  
https://medium.com/lego-engineering/think-and-develop-serverless-applications-as-set-pieces-4fa36d79ac3f  
In my previous articles on serverless, I used themes such as cooking, growing, fishing, and hiring. In this, I talk about football, movies, and music. “What do they have to do with serverless?”, you might ask. Well, there isn’t anything directly common between these themes and serverless. However, with some imagination and…

**Apple tells app devs to use IPv6 as it's 1.4 times faster than IPv4**  
https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-tells-app-devs-to-use-ipv6-as-its-1-4-times-faster-than-ipv4/  
Company also urges app devs to start using newer web tech like HTTP/2 and TLS 1.3, citing similar performance and speed improvements.

**Code Coverage Best Practices**  
https://testing.googleblog.com/2020/08/code-coverage-best-practices.html  
Every time code coverage is mentioned in any large group of people, seemingly endless arguments ensue. These tend to lead the conversation away from any productive progress, as people securely bunker in their respective camps. The purpose of this document is to give you tools to steer people on all ends of the spectrum to find common ground so that you can move forward and use coverage information pragmatically. We put forth best practices in the domain of code coverage to work effectively with code health.

**Pysa: An open source static analysis tool to detect and prevent security issues in Python code**  
https://engineering.fb.com/security/pysa/  
Pysa is a security-focused tool built on top of our type checker for Python, Pyre. It’s used to look at code and analyze how data flows through it. Analyzing data flows is useful because many security and privacy issues can be modeled as data flowing into a place it shouldn’t. 另附：[Pcicrawler: A Python-based command-line interface tool to debug PCI issues at scale](https://engineering.fb.com/open-source/pcicrawler/), [Django 3.1 Released](https://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2020/aug/04/django-31-released/).

**What is a data lake?**  
https://algorithmia.com/blog/what-is-a-data-lake  
A data lake is a centralized repository of all an organization’s data stored in its raw format. This allows enterprises to store all their data, in its natural or raw state, in one location. This includes structured, relational data with rows and columns, semi-structured data such as CSV or XML files, and unstructured data such as emails, documents, or PDFs.  The data lake holds every file of data within the enterprise so that no files will get lost, and any data can be pulled for analysis, visualization, or machine learning projects.

**Let's build a Full-Text Search engine**  
https://artem.krylysov.com/blog/2020/07/28/lets-build-a-full-text-search-engine/  
Full-Text Search (FTS) is a technique for searching text in a collection of documents. A document can refer to a web page, a newspaper article, an email message, or any structured text. Today we are going to build our own FTS engine. By the end of this post, we'll be able to search across millions of documents in less than a millisecond. We'll start with simple search queries like "give me all documents that contain the word cat" and we'll extend the engine to support more sophisticated boolean queries. 另附：[Hndex.org – a full-text search engine of articles submitted to HN](https://hndex.org/).

**What every developer should know about database consistency**  
https://robertovitillo.com/what-every-developer-should-know-about-database-consistency/  
Imagine assigning some value to a variable, reading it back immediately after, and finding out that somehow the write had no effect at all - madness! This is precisely what can happen when you are using a distributed data store with weak consistency guarantees. “But wait, aren’t databases supposed to take care of consistency issues for me?” I hear you ask. Whether an update becomes visible sooner rather than later depends on the guarantees offered by the database.

**Introducing TensorFlow Recorder**  
https://opensource.googleblog.com/2020/08/introducing-tensorflow-recorder.html  
When training computer vision machine learning models, data loading can often be a performance bottleneck, causing your GPU or TPU resources to be underutilized while waiting for data to be loaded into the model. Storing your dataset in the efficient TensorFlow Record (TFRecord) format is a great way to solve these problems, but creating TFRecords can unfortunately often require a great deal of complex code.

**A Roadmap for Angular**  
https://angular.io/guide/roadmap  
https://blog.angular.io/a-roadmap-for-angular-1b4fa996a771  
At the beginning of 2020 at ng-conf Hardwired, I talked about how we were evolving the team, improving our processes, and working to build stronger connections with the Angular community. One of the most important steps we are taking towards these goals is sharing more about what we’re working on, and some of the projects we’re considering for the future.
Today we’re adding a page on angular.io with our roadmap, which we’ll maintain at least quarterly ongoing.

**Announcing the new TypeScript Website**  
https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-the-new-typescript-website/

**Tech giants let the Web's metadata schemas and infrastructure languish**  
https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1291509746000855040.html  
Google and other tech giants are happy to have control over the Web's metadata schemas, but they let its infrastructure languish. Schema.org offers a great benefit to the tech industry, and Google especially, allowing them to extract rich information for their search engine they might never otherwise get. I’m simply asking all members of the Steering group to either.

**Latest Firefox rolls out Enhanced Tracking Protection 2.0; blocking redirect trackers by default**  
https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2020/08/04/latest-firefox-rolls-out-enhanced-tracking-protection-2-0-blocking-redirect-trackers-by-default/  
Last year we enabled ETP by default in Firefox because we believe that understanding the complexities and sophistication of the ad tracking industry should not be required to be safe online. ETP 1.0 was our first major step in fulfilling that commitment to users. Since we enabled ETP by default, we’ve blocked 3.4 trillion tracking cookies. With ETP 2.0, Firefox brings an additional level of privacy protection to the browser.

**You May Finally Use JSHint for Evil**  
http://mikepennisi.com/blog/2020/you-may-finally-use-jshint-for-evil/  
JSHint is a software tool designed to help developers write JavaScript code. Since its creation in 2011, it has been encumbered by a license which includes the following clause: The Software shall be used for Good, not Evil. That stipulation disqualifies JSHint from the distinction of “free” software and “open source” software. Today, with a release 7 years in the making, we’re removing the clause.

https://isux.tencent.com/articles/art-toys-trend.html  
玩具——「可玩之物」，泛指可用来玩的物品。广义上来讲，它不是只限于市面上售卖的供人玩的东西，凡是可以通过感官（视听触）进行游戏或把玩的东西，都可称之为玩具。也可以是不限材质的自然物体，如沙石泥树枝等非人工东西。本篇将主要围绕通常市面上所能流通的玩具商品做阐述。另附：[腾讯云剪-「企业级产品设计」设计师如何有章法的提升产品体验](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/GMxmrUn9iWNWYOBxDjMDxQ)。

**Design for Coherence, not Consistency**  
https://blog.prototypr.io/design-for-coherence-not-consistency-8d890760dc4c  
If we ask any design system advocate what are the main reasons to build and maintain a design system, chances are ‘Consistency’ will come up as first or second in their list, together with the ‘A single source of truth’ point, which is pretty much saying the same, with different words. This reasoning is valid but incomplete, and it could lead to a wrong product strategy and overall poor results.

**VUI: The Future of Voice Interface Design Explained**  
https://www.uxpin.com/studio/blog/voice-user-interface/  
Voice interface design uses speech recognition to allow users to engage with technology using voice commands. As the world becomes increasingly fast-paced and information-dense, voice technologies are challenging the dominance of the graphical user interface and can make the experience much smoother.  Keyboards can work for text-intensive tasks like writing a blog, but for simple tasks like searches, post updates, adjusting controls, and getting directions, people would rather just talk. They can save many steps, for example, typing in an address on a small screen, but the experience must function flawlessly. In reality, voice interface design works together with tap and swipe technologies to create a better user experience.

**Can You Design A Website For The Five Senses?**  
https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/08/design-website-five-senses/  
While you don’t want to design a website for all five senses — because that would most certainly lead to sensory overload — you can use individual senses to strengthen the experience visitors have. Let’s take a look at five ways you can use the senses to put your visitors in a better headspace when they enter your site and interact with your brand.
