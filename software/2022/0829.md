**Typescript is terrible for library developers**

I love typescript as an end-developer. However, as a library developer, I hate typescript. There are a lot of reasons why typescript sucks for library developers, but at the end of the day it reduces developer productivity. In effect, we are shifting complexity from end-developers to library developers. This places a huge burden on us to be experts with how typescript works.

**The Future of NGINX: Getting Back to Our Open Source Roots**  
https://www.nginx.com/blog/future-of-nginx-getting-back-to-our-open-source-roots/  
Each year at NGINX Sprint, our virtual user conference, we make new commitments for the coming year. This year is no different. Our promises for the next twelve months can be captured in three words: modernize, optimize, and extend. We intend to make sure these are not just business buzzwords; we have substantial programs for each one and we want you to hold us to our promises. 

**Contributing to open source - taking the dive**  
https://blog.scottlogic.com/2022/08/26/contributing-to-open-source-taking-the-dive.html  
Working on open source projects can be a great learning experience for any developer looking to expand their skills. It’s also a good way for newcomers to gain demonstrable, practical skills that could help them land their first developer job. However, getting started can be daunting. As a self-taught developer, despite having toyed with the idea when I first started learning, I never quite found the courage to dive in – being somewhat afraid of exposing my inexperience. In hindsight, it feels like a missed opportunity given that it could have provided me with some of the hands-on experience that I was lacking at the time.

**Using :has() as a CSS Parent Selector and much more**  
https://webkit.org/blog/13096/css-has-pseudo-class/  
https://www.zhangxinxu.com/wordpress/2022/08/css-has-pseudo-class/  
The WebKit team shipped :has() in Safari Technology Preview 137 in December 2021, and in Safari 15.4 on March 14, 2022. Igalia did the engineering work to implement :has() in Chromium, which will ship in Chrome 105 on August 30, 2022. Presumably the other browsers built on Chromium won’t be far behind. Mozilla is currently working on the Firefox implementation.

**Tauri VS. Electron - Real world application**  
https://www.levminer.com/blog/tauri-vs-electron  
In this article I'm going to compare Electron and Tauri using a real world app: Authme. Authme is a Simple cross-platform two-factor authenticator app for desktop. It's not a big app and not very complex, perfect for a little comparison. You can take a look at the source code of the Electron app on GitHub and the Tauri app is also on GitHub. My goal it that the Tauri app eventually replaces the Electron one.

**Meet the top layer: a solution to z-index:10000**  
https://developer.chrome.com/blog/what-is-the-top-layer/  
The top layer sits above its related document in the browser viewport, and each document has one associated top layer. This means that elements promoted to the top layer needn't worry about z-index or DOM hierarchy. They also get a neat ::backdrop pseudo-element to play with. The Fullscreen API spec goes into more details as Fullscreen was a great example of the top layer in use before dialog support came along.

**The minimum TypeScript you need for React**  
https://ente.io/blog/tech/typescript-for-react/  
But TypeScript is also has a learning curve. For some of us, it's a steep one. Everything is well documented, but there is a lot of the said documentation 😅. There are also cheetsheets, say for using TypeScript with React, but they assume a basic understanding of TypeScript. So what is missing (or at least I haven't found) are quick recipes for the most common use cases we run into when trying to introduce TypeScript into an existing React app. Here goes

**Reading Code - GitHub Hotkey**  
https://alexkondov.com/reading-code-github-hotkey/  
A small library that allows you to trigger actions on an element when a sequence of keys is pressed. It works directly with the DOM, it’s small enough to be understood easily and it utilizes interesting data structures that you don’t see every day.This was it.

**如何构建一个在线绘图工具：Feakin 是如何设计与构建的？**  
https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/558803698  
高中，读过几本 3D 图形编程相关的书。怎么说呢，自那以后，图形学相关的东西，都不在我的兴趣范围里了。直到最近，我重新燃起了一点兴趣：架构治理工具 ArchGuard 依赖于「图即代码」，用于生成架构图，以更好的进行架构治理。年初，开源的知识管理工具 Quake中，需要支持「概念构建系统」这样一个理念。需要管理多种不同的图形格式。

**An Introduction to Constraint Based Design Systems**  
https://www.colepeters.dev/posts/an-introduction-to-constraint-based-design-systems  
A design system is, at its core, a unifying tool. Implemented effectively, design systems reconcile an organization’s intent with its artefacts, by creating cohesion between the makers of those artefacts — that is, the organization’s designers and engineers.

**Spark: do you optimize the infrastructure?**  
https://shvbsle.in/do-you-optimize-your-infra/  
If your company is currently scaling up[1] then, you might be very well aware of how costly these experiments are. You probably lie in the pink colored valley. This is where you need to use large GPUs, Spark, BigTable, etc to make sense of data. But at this stage, you don't have the luxury of leaving a 200-node Spark cluster running over the weekend. You are running on a strict budget and you are trying to survive for as long as you can on that budget.

**Inside the Pinecone**  
https://www.pinecone.io/learn/inside-the-pinecone/  
Last week we announced a major update. The incredible work that led to the launch and the reaction from our users — a combination of delight and curiosity — inspired me to write this post. This is a glimpse into the journey of building a database company up to this point, some of the internal debates and decisions we made along the way (bad and good alike), and on-going innovation at the core of Pinecone that I find exciting.

It's not the reason you think. No, it's not that reason either.

Everyone should know why.

**Creativity requires solitude**  
https://dkb.show/post/creativity-requires-solitude  
Authenticity is the hallmark of a great artist, but it’s hard to be yourself when the outer world stifles your inner voice. The famous German-language poet, Rainer Maria Rilke, believed that solitude was the solution. In the following dialogue, I talk to Rilke about creativity, solitude, and patience.

**Vision-oriented and impact-oriented mindsets**  
https://glazkov.com/2022/08/25/vision-oriented-and-impact-oriented-mindsets/  
As one of my colleagues pointed out, an effective team needs a mix of both mindsets. The trick is that this mix has to shift pretty fluidly in complex spaces. It’s tough when a change in team direction suddenly turns the key contributors on your team into ornery naysayers. Or when it becomes hard to see where the team is heading in the chaff of heroic motion. I am not sure I have any great insights here, other than this: someone who can switch from one mindset to another, at least temporarily, is a truly precious find. If you’re gearing up for a long journey, those are the companions you want.

**我的知识加工厂——拒绝搬运**  
https://sspai.com/post/75264  
作为一位工业工程专业的毕业生，「搬运浪费」作为「八大浪费」之一是学习的重点，也是工作的切入点。但是我之前只将其应用于工作的生产过程，却忽略了自己的「知识加工」过程。我突然意识到，在我原本的知识管理流程中，「搬运」占据了很大一部分，而忽略了这是极大的浪费。这种搬运不产生任何附加值，也不会加深知识在自己大脑中的印象，也就不可能在以后需要的时候轻易调用。除了浪费时间和精力，顺便满足了自己内心小小的成就感和虚荣心之外，几乎没有益处。因为从生产的角度讲，「搬运」的知识只是从工厂门口搬运到了加工车间，堆放在角落里，几乎不可能搬上生产设备，更不可能成为有价值的「产品」。在少楠老师的推荐下，我开始接触 《卡片笔记写作法》 一书，尝试使用双链笔记工具重新打造我的「知识加工厂」。

一个项目的成败是一场有限游戏，但是通过短期的共事，增进对于彼此工作能力的了解，则是一场更有价值的无限游戏，这场游戏不仅持续了彼此的情谊，更为未来新的价值创造体系做了准备。

**这个时代比过去任何时候，都更呼唤企业家精神**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/MuBuyIdKaRJkuUGA9RMEfQ  
企业家首先是做好企业，让更多的消费者喜欢你的产品，把成本做得更低，但是质量做得更高，做出新的产品。这是你对社会做出的真正的贡献。当然你说自己有钱了以后或者退休了干什么？就我所知，大部分企业家都想在历史上留名，企业家和守财奴不一样，企业家不是守财奴，企业家不会像地主那样把财富埋在地底下，他会捐给社会。相关文章：[以一座城市的名义致敬-致全市企业家的一封信](https://baijiahao.baidu.com/s?id=1739650960723465501&wfr=spider&for=pc)。
