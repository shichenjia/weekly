**On the lack of open-source low-code tools**  
https://modeling-languages.com/on-the-lack-of-open-source-low-code-tools/  
I started intending to write a post about the best open-source low-code tools. Or at least the best free low-code tools. But I couldn’t find (almost) any. So, what I’m going to do is to share some random thoughts about why I think this is and its (unintended) consequences. And hope that you’ll join the discussion.

**Fetch API has landed into Node.js**

**The Data Visualization Tools Wars**  
https://policyviz.com/2022/02/01/the-data-visualization-tools-wars/  
I thought I would share what I see as the major data visualization tools currently in use (arranged alphabetically). Every tool has its own camp of people who argue their tool is the best, but I’m a believer in just using the best tool for the specific task. As you likely know, I do a lot of my data visualization work in Excel, but I don’t run regressions or create online interactive dashboards in Excel because it’s not the best tool for those jobs. I’m also not going to ask every person I work with to learn JavaScript to create simple line charts.

**Building Infrastructure Platforms**  
https://martinfowler.com/articles/building-infrastructure-platform.html#FindOutWhatYourCustomersNeed  
Infrastructure Platform teams enable organisations to scale delivery by solving common product and non-functional requirements with resilient solutions. This allows other teams to focus on building their own things and releasing value for their users. But nobody said building scalable platforms was easy... In this article Poppy and Chris explore 7 key principles which can help you build the right thing right. Spoiler: don't skip strategy, user experience and research.

**A collaborative hub for infrastructure as code**  https://stackoverflow.blog/2022/02/02/a-collaborative-hub-for-infrastructure-as-code/  
https://spacelift.io/  
Infrastructure as code is growing in popularity, but to adopt it at scale, organizations need better ways to collaborate and automate it.

**Pay attention to WebAssembly**  
https://harshal.sheth.io/2022/01/31/webassembly.html  
WebAssembly is at an inflection point. Over the next few years, I expect to see increased adoption of WebAssembly across the tech sphere, from containerization to plugin systems to serverless computing platforms. The following is a discussion of what WebAssembly is, what makes it a relevant technology, and where it’s being used today. I’ll also describe some potentially high-impact applications and make some predictions about its future.

**Why I Always use Angular**  
https://sam-redmond.com/why-i-always-use-angular-5efcf31d739a  
It’s no secret, at this point, that I’m a fan of the Angular framework. I’ve made a lot of comparisons with React, but today I want to do something a little different. This article will be focused on the things I love about Angular and why I use it for all my projects.

**Go-to-Market in Web3: New Mindsets, Tactics, Success Metrics**  
https://future.a16z.com/go-to-market-in-web3-new-mindsets-tactics-success-metrics/  
Since web3 is still new to so many, yet there’s tremendous building in the space, in this article I share some new frameworks for thinking about GTM in this context, as well as where different types of organizations may exist in the ecosystem. I’ll also offer some tips and tactics for builders looking to create their own web3 GTM strategies as the space continues to evolve.

**design system versioning: single library or individual components?**  https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/design-system-versioning-single-library-or-individual-components/  
You can version a design system’s component library as a single package (e.g. Polaris v8.0), or you can version each component within the library as its own mini package (e.g. Atlaskit Badge v15.0.8) This post breaks down the pros and cons of versioning the whole library vs individual components.

**The Story of React**

This is the story of how React took over the world. Releated: [What You Should Definitely Look Out For In React In 2022](https://www.chakshunyu.com/blog/what-you-should-definitely-look-out-for-in-react-in-2022/)  

**Speeding up VSCode (extensions) in 2022**  
https://jason-williams.co.uk/speeding-up-vscode-extensions-in-2022  
I was curious to know if the functionality of VSCode can catch up with the native speed of some editors, such as Sublime. That led me to seek out where some bottlenecks may be and where time is being spent. In this post I look at both the internals and extensions.

**The complete beginners guide to dynamic programming**  
https://stackoverflow.blog/2022/01/31/the-complete-beginners-guide-to-dynamic-programming/  
Dynamic programming isn't about design patterns; it's a way of thinking that breaks down a problem into individual components.

**WebVM: server-less x86 virtual machines in the browser**  
https://leaningtech.com/webvm-server-less-x86-virtual-machines-in-the-browser/  
We made a server-less virtual Linux environment that runs unmodified Debian binaries in the browser. This is powered by CheerpX, a WebAssembly virtualization platform. Feel free to play with it and report bugs: https://webvm.io

**A Tale of Two Features**  
https://testing.googleblog.com/2022/02/a-tale-of-two-features.html  
I have often been asked, “What is the most memorable bug that you have encountered in your testing career?” For me, it is hands down a bug that happened quite a few years ago. What makes this bug so memorable is that I spent so much time developing a comprehensive suite of test scenarios, yet a failure occurred during such an obvious use case that it left me shaking my head and wondering how I had missed it. Even with many years of testing experience it can be very humbling to construct scenarios that adequately mirror what will happen in the field.

**How AI powers great search results**  
https://blog.google/products/search/how-ai-powers-great-search-results/  
Do you ever wonder how Google understands what you’re looking for? There’s a lot that goes into delivering helpful search results, and understanding language is one of the most important skills. Thanks to advancements in AI and machine learning, our Search systems are understanding human language better than ever before. And we want to share a behind-the-scenes look at how this translates into relevant results for you.

**Competitive programming with AlphaCode**  
https://deepmind.com/blog/article/Competitive-programming-with-AlphaCode  
As part of DeepMind’s mission to solve intelligence, we created a system called AlphaCode that writes computer programs at a competitive level. AlphaCode achieved an estimated rank within the top 54% of participants in programming competitions by solving new problems that require a combination of critical thinking, logic, algorithms, coding, and natural language understanding. In our preprint, we detail AlphaCode, which uses transformer-based language models to generate code at an unprecedented scale, and then smartly filters to a small set of promising programs.

**当我们谈论效率的时候，我们在谈论什么**  
https://sspai.com/post/71159  
「效率」，放置在个人和整体中，这是一个做事的时候皆需要考虑的词。在个人层面上，我们谈论「效率」时，通常它的前面会有一个修饰语，比如「学习效率」、「工作效率」。在我们说提高效率的时候，指的是在做一件事时，能够用更快的速度，更简单的方式实现它。高效也是一个大多数人都关心的话题，而且「如何利用各种效率工具让自己变得更高效」，似乎已经成为了一个预设好的、默认的好的事情。在 2021 年，我也不出意外地使用了很多软件、尝试了很多种工具，主要包括知识的获取和整理，时间和日程的管理。与之前不同，我的一大改变是不再追求更复杂更齐全的功能，更倾向使用简单的、但可以达到核心需求的工具。

**35岁以后，别做职场中的奢侈品**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/vkR26U5JOsHxO6TDvn2avw  
35岁以后，千万别做职场中的“奢侈品”。什么叫“奢侈品”？就是那些又贵又没用的东西。每个进入职场的人，都在从“不吃草的千里马”，逐步变成“又贵又没用的奢侈品”。随着工作年份的增加，职位的升高，资历的增长，你的价格总是越来越贵。但是科技的变化，环境的变化，竞争的变化，导致过去的能力和知识，却在越来越没用。这就像热力学第二定律，在没有外部能量输入的情况之下，走向熵增几乎是必然的。在没有自己刻意改变的情况下，变成职场的“奢侈品”也是必然的。但是市场上在不断涌现那些，刚毕业的，不吃草的千里马。所以每隔一段时间，公司就会把职场上的“奢侈品”换成不吃草的千里马，如此往复。直到这些马，再变成新的“奢侈品”。唯一能改变这个定律的，就是不断输入新的能量，让自己变成“吃草的万里马”。

**The Time Hack Everyone Should Know**

This isn’t to say social economizing — if you haven’t been doing it — will be easy from the start. It takes about 66 days to solidify a habit. But envisioning your life two months from now may be all the motivation you need to make the switch. You might be exercising more, socializing more, and enjoying more time with the humans you adore most.

**Settings are not a design failure**  
https://linear.app/blog/settings-are-not-a-design-failure  
While I was reorganizing my phone, I had a sudden realization: Settings are typically seen as the result of design failure. The thinking goes that as designers, our goal is to create product experiences that don’t require any adjustments by the user. Consequently, offering customization options is interpreted as a failure to make firm product decisions. I think there is a misunderstanding about what settings really are.

**My Fourth Year as a Bootstrapped Founder**  
https://mtlynch.io/solo-developer-year-4/  
Four years ago, I quit my job as a developer at Google to create my own self-funded software company. For the first few years, all of my businesses flopped. They all operated at a loss, and none of them earned more than a few hundred dollars per month in revenue. Halfway through my third year, I created a network administration device called TinyPilot. It quickly caught on, and it’s been my main focus ever since. TinyPilot generated $460k in 2021, its first full year in operation. In this post, I’ll share what I’ve learned from TinyPilot about being a bootstrapped founder.
