**The Foundation of Product**  
https://www.svpg.com/the-foundation-of-product/  
In order for the product team to come up with effective solutions, there are three constituencies that you will need unencumbered access to, in order to have any real hope of success:
- Direct Access To Users and Customers  
- Direct Access to Business Stakeholders  
- Direct Access to Engineers

**The Age of PageRank is Over**  
https://blog.kagi.com/age-pagerank-over  
This process produces self-enforcing monopolies in almost every sphere of online life - search, news, entertainment, social media… All these monopolies have two things in common: They are a product of advertising-based business models; They are unhealthy for our digital society and an antithesis to what the internet was supposed to be - fun, quirky, and exciting. Instead, they attempt to control almost every aspect of our online life and culture. And this is why we built Kagi. We felt a strong need to stop this madness and reverse the direction the web is heading in. The main reason Kagi exists is to offer a radically different view of the web, one close to its original intention and one in which the users and their needs are in the center of the universe. The future of search is user-centric.  

**GitHub Blocks: Reimagine repositories**  
https://blocks.githubnext.com/  
Extend your codebase with custom, interactive blocks. Build rich documentation, enhance your workflows, and bring your repository to life.

**Managing Complex Change**  
https://addyosmani.com/blog/managing-complex-change/  
The "Managing Complex Change model" is an effective framework that can be used in any organization to initiate change. The model was created by Dr. Mary Lippitt, a leadership and management consultant who specializes in helping organizations navigate through change. In this blog post, we briefly examine each step of the model and how it may apply to your organization's unique situation. 

**Mastodon - Decentralized social media**  
https://joinmastodon.org/  
Social networking that's not for sale. Your home feed should be filled with what matters to you most, not what a corporation thinks you should see. Radically different social media, back in the hands of the people. Related:

**Inside the mind of a frontend developer: Hero section**

In this article, I will take you into the journey of building a hero section by showing you my thought process, why I picked a certain solution over another, the pros and cons of it, and if there are any potential challenges or issues along the way.

**Why We Should Have Markdown Rendered Websites**  
https://ipfs.io/ipfs/bafybeid7lt7snuzcvcmfqs5a5hlc5fmk3xmflz4hx2qa7c674vm3rpsdvm/why-we-should-have-markdown-rendered-websites.html  
Stopping to frame the browser as a "user-hosted and abstracted computing platform" towards a presentation-independent data format for text. I think both can co-exist and I don't want to argue away the legit use cases of HTML, CSS and JS. But with HTML5 and since I've professionally joined the movement in 2015, the tools have had such great escape velocity and complexity has increased so dramatically: We really need a new publishing tool for everyone that doesn't require intricate knowledge of how the entire web computing stack functions.

**AWS IAM Roles, a tale of unnecessary complexity**

**The Future of DevOps Is No-Code**  
https://www.infoq.com/articles/devops-future-no-code/  
If you aren’t a DevOps organization already, chances are you soon will be. And you will need as many qualified DevOps team members as you can get your hands on. No-code and low-code DevOps tools are an easy way to build your stable of developers while freeing up your existing developers to focus their time on getting quality products out the door.

**Tulip: Schematizing Meta’s data platform**  
https://engineering.fb.com/2022/11/09/developer-tools/tulip-schematizing-metas-data-platform/  
Schematization of data plays an important role in a data platform at Meta’s scale. These systems are designed with the knowledge that every decision and trade-off can impact the reliability, performance, and efficiency of data processing, as well as our engineers’ developer experience.  Making huge bets, like changing serialization formats for the entire data infrastructure, is challenging in the short term, but offers greater long-term benefits that help the platform evolve over time.
