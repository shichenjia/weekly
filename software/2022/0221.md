**Building for the 99% Developers**  
https://future.a16z.com/software-development-building-for-99-developers/  
It matters to talk about the 99% Developers because these are the developers building the software that powers our lives — insurance, health care, retail, and banking, just to name a few. It’s not only small companies that can’t easily adopt the processes of modern, tech-first companies; it’s most companies that were not built around technology and that have decades of legacy software practices firmly in place. Many of these companies move around quite a bit of money. Many of these companies handle quite a bit of our personal data. If technology innovations are not benefiting these software teams, we’re losing out on a lot of meaningful improvements to everyone’s quality of life. In this piece, I’ll present some truths that both enterprise software buyers and builders can embrace to dispel harmful myths and improve developer experience for all.

**Supercharge your event-driven architecture with new Cloud Functions (2nd gen)**  
https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/serverless/introducing-the-next-generation-of-cloud-functions  
We are introducing Cloud Functions (2nd gen) into public preview, Google Cloud’s next-generation Functions-as-a-Service product.

**Free DataViz Tools & Resources**  
https://policyviz.com/2022/02/14/free-dataviz-tools-resources/  
A colleague recently asked me for any publicly available, free resources they might use to up their data visualization game. There’s obviously a great big world out there of great resources to help you on your way to being an effective data communicator. Personally, there are certain blogs, tools, and resources that bubble to the top and which I regularly suggest to people. I also regularly check out certain news organizations for their data visualization work—I’ll publish a follow-up post soon with those I follow most closely. Releated: [Should we give awards for data visualizations?](https://policyviz.com/2022/02/17/should-we-give-awards-for-data-visualizations/).  

**Thoughts On Markdown**  
https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2022/02/thoughts-on-markdown/  
Markdown in all its flavors, interpretations, and forks won’t go away. However, it’s important to look at emerging content formats that try to encompass modern needs. In this article, Knut shares his advice against Markdown by looking back on why it was introduced in the first place, and by going through some of the major developments of content on the web.

**Some reasons for disliking React hooks**  
https://blog.bitsrc.io/some-reasons-for-disliking-react-hooks-80f1e18eb9b3  
React hooks have been introduced in React 16.8. Their aim is described on the React documentation: They let you use state and other React features without writing a class. Quite soon after the announcement I had a look at them, and I was running through the following cycle since then: I disliked hooks, mainly because they were new and it’s probably people’s nature to be skeptical about new things, although most developers (including me) are probably too skeptical

**Deep dive into React Native’s New Architecture**  
https://medium.com/coox-tech/deep-dive-into-react-natives-new-architecture-fb67ae615ccd  
“2022 is going to be the year of the New Architecture in open source”. Since the release is just around the corner, this is a good time to understand what changes are taking place under the hood and how they might affect your React Native App. This article aims to cover the most important changes bought by the re-architecture. Releated: [Calling Windows APIs from React Native just got easier](https://microsoft.github.io/react-native-windows/blog/2022/02/11/rnwinrt).  

**Why are hyperlinks blue?**  
https://css-tricks.com/why-are-hyperlinks-blue/  
Last year, Elise Blanchard did some great historical research and discovered that blue hyperlinks replaced black hyperlinks in 1993. They’ve been blue for so long now that the general advice I always hear is to keep them that way. There is powerful societal muscle memory for “blue text is a clickable link.”

**Why is Python so Popular?**  
https://blog.sentry.io/2022/02/15/guest-post-why-is-python-so-popular  
But even in the face of these limitations, Python not only survived but thrived. Indeed, nearly 50% of developers use Python in some fashion, a number exceeded only by JavaScript and HTML/CSS. And just last year, Python was named the Programming Language of the Year in the TIOBE Programming Community Index, moving up from the third spot in 2020. So why is Python so popular?

**What does it mean to listen on a port?**

This story explores some concepts in computer networking, inspired by Michael Nielsen’s idea of discovery fiction. Code samples can also be found in [this repo](https://github.com/paulgb/wdimtloap). Excerpts use openbsd-flavoured netcat on Debian Linux; behviour and IPv6 support may vary by version.

**Google Search Is Dying**  
https://dkb.io/post/google-search-is-dying  
There is good discussion on this article on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30347719) and [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/st9ri1/google_search_is_dying/). Reddit is currently the most popular search engine. The only people who don’t know that are the team at Reddit, who can’t be bothered to build a decent search interface. So instead we resort to using Google, and appending the word “reddit” to the end of our queries. Paul Graham thinks this image means Reddit as a social media site “still hasn’t peaked”. What it actually means is that the amount of people using Reddit as a search engine is growing.

https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/cfH1M9k7x0DJaFRYOxcHEg  
分解类的工作或者进度管理类的工作会由不同工具完成的，因为不同工具各有所长。但如果我们只是一个小型的工作项目，或者个人的临时项目，很可能我们不会愿意把事情搞得太复杂，也不想卷入太多工具，这时一个 All-In-One 的管理工具就很有价值。今天我们要介绍的就是这款 多功能的任务分解和管理工具， Taskade

**西方逻辑与东方辩证：逻辑与道的对峙**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/jvOJ6fTY5DEbWuXNJUP5Hw  
一些东西方思维中蕴含的基本原则迥然不同。西方思维是分析式的,强调认同逻辑概念,坚持非矛盾的观点;东方思维是整体式的,鼓励人们认识到变化,接受矛盾。西方思维鼓励将形式从内容中抽离,以便评估论断的效度。结果是西方人避免了东方人会犯的一些逻辑错误。东方思维产生了对于世界诸多方面的更准确的信念,也对人类行为的原因做出了更恰当的解释。东方思维强调关注影响事物和人类行为的情境因素,同样也要求人们认识到事物发展过程和个体都存在变化的可能性。

**谷爱凌你学不了，但你可以去拿下人生中的那个锦州**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/hlkDm9mZfCdwPlcMBgVCjA  
有的人，清醒地看到了他人生中的那座“锦州”城，并且坚决果断地拿下了它；有的人，终其一生，从来就没有意识到有一座“锦州”城池曾经在他生命中那么明确地存在着，而他却没有珍惜；有的人，虽然模糊地意识到了他人生好像有那么一座“锦州”城池，却因为对自己人生的终极目标不甚明了，从而缺乏全局思维，难以拥有穿透性判断力看见他的“锦州”城在何时、何地、乃至是他生命中的何人；有的人，已经明确地意识到了一座“锦州”城出现在他眼前，但出于这样那样的顾虑，他并没有下定全力拿下它的决心，或是一开始就把主要精力浪费到打长春中去了。还有的人，还有其他各种情形可以列出。这个世界依旧一日不息地转个不停，浑浑噩噩者依旧每天睡到自然醒，庸庸碌碌者依旧对现状满心欢喜，中国的进步青年们也依然在全力打拼，而那些追求止于至善者也依旧从未停下划向彼岸的船桨。在这个春天，你有没有看见一座“锦州”城要打下？
