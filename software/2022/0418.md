**Innovating beyond libraries and frameworks**  
https://nilsnh.no/2022/04/09/innovating-beyond-libraries-and-frameworks/  
I believe we should look beyond libraries and frameworks and rediscover the value of patterns and principles, and I’d argue that it would lead us to have less breaking changes and add more longevity to the stuff we build. I have been a big fan of the [write libraries, not frameworks](https://www.brandons.me/blog/libraries-not-frameworks) argument for a while now. Lately, I’ve come to ponder that there might be a fruitful expansion to this argument, that we should start to value principles over patterns, patterns over libraries, and libraries over frameworks.

Lexical is an extensible JavaScript web text-editor framework with an emphasis on reliability, accessibility and performance. Lexical aims to provide a best-in-class developer experience, so you can easily prototype and build features with confidence. Combined with a highly extensible architecture, Lexical allows developers to create unique text editing experiences that scale in size and functionality.

**A modern web experience on Adobe Experience Manager with WorkBox**  
https://web.dev/aem-with-workbox/  
If you are a technical lead or digital marketing analyst interested in providing a modern Web experience to your Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) web application and have been looking for your options in doing so, then you have come to the right article. This will cover what Progressive Web Apps (PWA) are and what you need to create a PWA in AEM leveraging the WorkBox library through configuration, without coding.

**You can automate more than you think**  
https://buttondown.email/hillelwayne/archive/you-can-automate-more-than-you-think/  
I have mild ADHD. I can focus on strenuous mental tasks, but I can’t handle boring or repetitive work. Even something like “manually navigating to a folder” is enough to make procrastinate. I’m always looking for ways to aggressively optimize my workflow. For example, one thing I have to do a lot is type my address into emails and chats and the like. For most people that isn’t a big deal, but for me it’s disruptive. One tool I use, AutoHotKey,1 has “hotstrings”: if you type a hotstring, it replaces the text with a substitute.

**10 Things I (Still) Love About Programming**  
https://www.simplethread.com/10-things-i-still-love-about-programming/  
This post was inspired by my cofounder Justin’s post on [20 Things I’ve Learned in my 20 Years as a Software Engineer](https://www.simplethread.com/20-things-ive-learned-in-my-20-years-as-a-software-engineer/). I don’t have much to add to that list, but reading through those items, I found myself thinking of all the things I still love about software engineering, even after doing it for 20 years. I’ve included 10 items below that still bring me joy.

**Agile and the Long Crisis of Software**  
https://logicmag.io/clouds/agile-and-the-long-crisis-of-software/  
I began to explore the history of Agile. What I discovered was a long-running wrestling match between what managers want software development to be and what it really is, as practiced by the workers who write the code. Time and again, organizations have sought to contain software’s most troublesome tendencies—its habit of sprawling beyond timelines and measurable goals—by introducing new management styles. And for a time, it looked as though companies had found in Agile the solution to keeping developers happily on task while also working at a feverish pace. Recently, though, some signs are emerging that Agile’s power may be fading. A new moment of reckoning is in the making, one that may end up knocking Agile off its perch.

**NodeJS packages don't deserve your trust**  
https://josephg.com/blog/node-sandbox/  
Another week, another [npm supply chain attack](https://github.com/Yaffle/EventSource/blob/de137927e13d8afac153d2485152ccec48948a7a/src/eventsource.js#L1047-L1090). Yikes! People on hacker news are wringing their hands about what should be done. The problem seems dire. Apparently I couldn't help myself. At 2am the other night I woke up, staring at the ceiling. I couldn't stop thinking about this problem. It seems .. frankly, solvable. But how? I think I came up with an answer. Or, the sketch of an answer. Is it any good? Will it work? I think it might... You be the judge.

**One million broken web sites – and a way to prevent that**  https://christianheilmann.com/2022/04/12/one-million-broken-web-sites-and-a-way-to-prevent-that/  
Webaim.org releases an annual report called the WebAIM Million. This is a deep analysis of the one million most visited web sites how accessible they are. And every year the result is pretty grim. Across the one million home pages, 50,829,406 distinct accessibility errors were detected—an average of 50.8 errors per page. This is 1.1% fewer errors than last year, but at the same time home pages of sites have become more complex. On average, home pages have 955 elements and 5.3% of those have accessibility errors. This means that users with disabilities would expect to encounter errors on 1 in every 19 home page elements with which they engage.

**JavaScript function composition: What’s the big deal**  
https://jrsinclair.com/articles/2022/javascript-function-composition-whats-the-big-deal/  
To hear some people talk, you’d think function composition was some kind of sacred truth. A holy principle to meditate upon whilst genuflecting and lighting incense. But function composition is not complicated. You probably use it all the time, whether you realise it or not. Why, then, do functional programmers get all worked up about it? What’s the big deal?

**One year of Preview.js, aka React Preview**  
https://www.indiehackers.com/post/one-year-of-preview-js-aka-react-preview-392157fd92  
It's been a bit more than a year since I started working on Preview.js, so I thought I'd write about my journey so far. Preview.js is an extension/plugin for Visual Studio Code and IntelliJ/WebStorm that helps developers preview any React, Vue or SolidJS component instantly in their IDE, without having to write code or spin up a local server.

**React Folder Structure in 5 Steps [2022]**  
https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-folder-structure/  
After implementing React applications for a few years now, I want to give you a breakdown on how I approach this matter for my personal projects, for my freelance projects, and for my React workshops. It only takes 5 steps, and you decide what makes sense to you and how far you want to push it. So let's get started.

**终端新玩法：技术栈无关的剧本式引导**  
https://tech.meituan.com/2022/03/31/waimai-application-scripted-guidance.html

**The Scoop: Inside the Longest Atlassian Outage of All Time**  
https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/scoop-atlassian?s=r  
Hundreds of companies have no access to JIRA, Confluence and OpsGenie. What can engineering teams learn from the poor handling of this outage?

**Building a WebAssembly-powered serverless platform**  
https://blog.scottlogic.com/2022/04/16/wasm-faas.html  
I’ve written a range of WebAssembly applications using Rust, AssemblyScript and a bit of hand-coding, but haven’t worked directly with a WebAssembly runtime before. I thought it would be fun to create a simple WebAssembly-powered serverless platform, to see what it is like to create a ‘product’ based on WebAssembly. Turns out, it is really quite easy 😀

**How To Practice Sustainable Development Processes In Serverless!**  
https://medium.com/lego-engineering/how-to-practice-sustainable-development-processes-in-serverless-8be695dbd6fd  
In Part I: Think Sustainability While Developing Serverless Applications, we discussed why sustainability is applicable in serverless developments. In Part II: How To Build Sustainable Serverless Applications, we looked at the longevity of applications and ways to sustain them. In this Part III, the focus is on the sustainable development processes that help build our serverless solutions.

**How to build a CMS-powered blog with Nuxt**  
https://blog.openreplay.com/how-to-build-a-cms-powered-blog-with-nuxt  
There are a couple of ways we can add a blog to a site. One way is to use a Headless CMS, which will power the blog. In this tutorial, we’ll be looking at what a Headless CMS is, the options available for us to use, and the front-end framework that will be best for our blog.

**Software Architecture: It Might Not Be What You Think It Is**  
https://www.infoq.com/articles/what-software-architecture/  
Software architecture needs to be wrested from committees of people disconnected from developing, and to put it in the hands of the people who can actually make it real and executable, the developers. Only then will we achieve the resilience and sustainability that we need from today’s applications

**Why the Past 10 Years of American Life Have Been Uniquely Stupid**  
https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2022/05/social-media-democracy-trust-babel/629369/  
http://www.geekpark.net/news/301314  
The story of Babel is the best metaphor I have found for what happened to America in the 2010s, and for the fractured country we now inhabit. Something went terribly wrong, very suddenly. We are disoriented, unable to speak the same language or recognize the same truth. We are cut off from one another and from the past. Babel is a metaphor for what some forms of social media have done to nearly all of the groups and institutions most important to the country’s future—and to us as a people. How did this happen? And what does it portend for American life?

**当我是 flomo 的经营者时，我在思考些什么**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/kmXpvmr3jj2bPagHOXTJLg  
2020 年冬夜，我与少楠在北京望京涮着羊肉火锅，愉快地达成共识——这次做 flomo，不用刻意追逐做到多少用户量、多少营收、多少估值。取而代之，我们希望追求的是——flomo 能够体面地，存在尽可能长的时间。这并非无意义的坐而论道，而是会影响到许多具体且重要的决策。

**一份内针简易保健单，请查收！**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/k13uNz0GFDg3TMWwsAwewg  
夜里1点多，被同小区某户的“夜半歌声”吵醒，习惯性地翻看手机，发现有个上海同学在内针品读会群里求助，大意是她母亲因不便就医，胃痛了两三天，夜里又变严重了，人很虚弱，情况有些糟，但是自己没学过内针，不知道该怎样做。发消息的时候是夜里11点左右，我看到时已过去两个多小时，随即加她微信，但是没有回应。凌晨5点多，我看见杨真海师父也在群里关心她母亲的情况。早晨7点左右，我看见她在群里说，母亲缓过来一点了，感觉没那么危急了，不过人还是很虚弱，吃不了东西。我和她也联系上了。在当下这个特殊时期，居家遇到身体不适怎么办？在及时就医的同时，不妨用内针的一些方法来帮助缓解或改善不适症状。没有学过内针的同学可以吗？“一阴一阳之谓道”，“百姓日用而不知”，知固然好，不知亦能日用，道从未远人，没有系统学习过内针，可以用一些简易方法来应急。
