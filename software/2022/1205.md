**The best leaders are great individual contributors, not professional managers**  
https://www.inc.com/jeff-haden/37-years-ago-steve-jobs-said-best-managers-never-want-to-be-a-manager-science-says-he-was-right.html  
We're going to be a big company, we thought. So let's hire "professional managers." We went out and hired a bunch of professional management, and it didn't work at all. They knew how to manage, but they didn't know how to do anything. Releated:

**Speeding up the JavaScript ecosystem - one library at a time**  
https://marvinh.dev/blog/speeding-up-javascript-ecosystem/  
Most popular libraries can be sped up by avoiding unnecessary type conversions or by avoiding creating functions inside functions.

**Hexagonal-Inspired Architecture in React**  
https://alexkondov.com/hexagonal-inspired-architecture-in-react/  
My grudge against the front-end community is that we’re too focused on improving low-level APIs and building new tools instead of thinking about architecture and patterns. We’ve iterated on state management a thousand times, but we’re yet to translate important programming concepts to the UI. I will try to explain how we can apply the concepts of hexagonal architecture in React.

**Tech predictions for 2023 and beyond**  
https://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2022/12/tech-predictions-for-2023-and-beyond.html  
The next wave of innovators and inventors, a few of whom I was fortunate to have met while filming Now Go Build, are already building solutions to reforest the planet, keep our youth active, and re-imagine the supply chain from the warehouse to delivery. And this is truly just the beginning. As access to advanced technology becomes even more ubiquitous—as every facet of life becomes data that we can analyze—we will start to see a torrent of innovation, and this will proliferate in 2023.

**Introducing a product delivery culture at Etsy**  
https://martinfowler.com/articles/bottlenecks-of-scaleups/etsy-product-delivery-culture.html  
While the cloud migration was happening, Etsy was growing its business and its team. Mike identified the product delivery process as being another potential scaling bottleneck. The autonomy afforded to product teams had caused an issue: each team was delivering in different ways. Joining a team meant learning a new set of practices, which was problematic as Etsy was hiring many new people. In addition, they had noticed several product initiatives that did not pay off as expected. These indicators led leadership to re-evaluate the effectiveness of their product planning and delivery processes.

**How we all develop and support free software**  
https://sfconservancy.org/blog/2022/nov/29/giving-tuesday-pono-appeal/  
Today is Giving Tuesday, and I'd like to share part of my story that brought me to Software Freedom Conservancy. Having started as a donor over 5 years ago, I find myself now with even more passion for our mission as an employee.

**The BBC's 15 Web Principles: 15 Years Later**  
https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2022/11/the-bbcs-15-web-principles-15-years-later/  
There's a fair bit of early-web-2.0 idealism in these 15 principles. In truth, I'm hard pressed to disagree with any of them. Throughout the web - not just on the BBC - they are often observed mostly in the breach. I wonder if the BBC is culturally capable of producing something like this in 2022? And, more importantly, enforcing it on its own sites? What will the next 15 years bring?

**Tailwind is a Leaky Abstraction**  
https://jakelazaroff.com/words/tailwind-is-a-leaky-abstraction/  
Well, I've spent the past few months at work learning Tailwind with an open mind. I can now confidently say that I do, in fact, dislike Tailwind, and I wouldn't use it for any new projects.

**Frontend developers: stop moving things that I’m about to click on**  
https://medium.com/@stephenjayakar/frontend-developers-stop-moving-things-that-im-about-to-click-on-5827bc0409b3  
Please. It’s an insult to my brain. Like, you put the button in one place, and then you’re like “nah, let’s move it somewhere else.” Here are some examples that have annoyed me the most lately.  

**When to use gRPC vs GraphQL**  
https://stackoverflow.blog/2022/11/28/when-to-use-grpc-vs-graphql/  
We dig into two of the most popular API protocols to see where they work best.

**CRDT: Fractional Indexing**  
https://madebyevan.com/algos/crdt-fractional-indexing/  
Collaborative peer-to-peer applications sometimes need to operate on sequences of objects with a consistent order across all peers. For example, a peer-to-peer photo album application might need to sync the order in which photos appear in an album. The algorithm presented here is one way to do this. It comes from a family of algorithms called CRDTs, which I will not describe here. Unlike my original article about this technique, the algorithm presented here uses random offsets to avoid requiring a central server, and works in true peer-to-peer scenarios. Compared to tree-based indexing, fractional indexing is simpler but doesn't prevent interleaving of concurrently-inserted runs, which makes it inappropriate for textual data.

**The Best Go framework: no framework?**  
https://threedots.tech/post/best-go-framework/  
Other languages have established, “default” frameworks. Java has Spring, Python has Django and Flask, Ruby has Rails, C# has ASP.NET, Node has Express, and PHP has Symfony and Laravel. Go is different: there is no default framework. What’s even more interesting, many suggest you shouldn’t use a framework at all. Are they insane?

**Cache invalidation really is one of the hardest problems in computer science**  
https://surfingcomplexity.blog/2022/11/25/cache-invalidation-really-is-one-of-the-hardest-things-in-computer-science/  
My colleagues recently wrote a great post on the Netflix tech blog about a tough performance issue they wrestled with. They ultimately diagnosed the problem as false sharing, which is a performance problem that involves caching. I’m going to take that post and write a simplified version of part of it here, as an exercise to help me understand what happened. After all, the best way to understand something is to try to explain it to someone else.

**Goodbye, Data Science**  
https://ryxcommar.com/2022/11/27/goodbye-data-science/  
So, ultimately I have no regrets having done data science, but I am also enjoying the transition to data engineering. I continue to do data science in the sense that these roles are murkily defined (at both my “data scientist” and “data engineer” jobs I spend like 40% of the time writing downstream SQL transformations), I get to critique and provide feedback on data science work, and, hey, I actually did deploy some math heavy code recently. Hell, you could argue I’m just a data scientist who manages the data science infra at a company.

**Talking to Robots in Real Time**  
https://ai.googleblog.com/2022/12/talking-to-robots-in-real-time.html  
Ideally, robots of the future would react in real time to any relevant task a user could describe in natural language. Particularly in open human environments, it may be important for end users to customize robot behavior as it is happening, offering quick corrections ("stop, move your arm up a bit") or specifying constraints ("nudge that slowly to the right"). Furthermore, real-time language could make it easier for people and robots to collaborate on complex, long-horizon tasks, with people iteratively and interactively guiding robot manipulation with occasional language feedback.

**Photography for geeks**  
https://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/photo_basics/  
Billions of people carry cameras in their pockets and use them to document their lives. Yet, despite the democratization of photo hardware, the knowledge of photographic techniques remains elusive. Countless books, webpages, and YouTube videos purport to offer advice, but tend to dwell on topics of little consequence to most hobbyists - such as shopping for gear or memorizing made-up rules of composition that seldom make for a good shot.

**Proprioceptive writing: a method for embodied self-reflection**  
https://nesslabs.com/proprioceptive-writing  
Expensive and time-consuming options are off the table, so it has been refreshing to learn about a free method for boosting self-awareness: proprioceptive writing. This process combines meditation and writing, two of the most effective ways to tap into the inner self.

宇宙之中，水有一种独一无二的性格。如果给以巨大的压强，把水从一个极小的孔以极快的速度喷射出去，其锋利能够切割钢板。如果散开，自由流动，她们就柔顺无比，浸入无边无际的土壤，滋养一切的生命。有趣的是，很多企业，很多组织，为了生存，会无意中把自己锤炼成像水一样。
