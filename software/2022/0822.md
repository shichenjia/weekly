**Big Changes Ahead for Deno**  
https://deno.com/blog/changes  
We've been working on some updates that will allow Deno to easily import npm packages and make the vast majority of npm packages work in Deno within the next three months. Our goal is to make Deno the fastest JavaScript runtime. For starters, the next release of Deno will include a new HTTP server. It is the fastest JavaScript web server ever built.

**Evolution of low-code platforms**  
https://modeling-languages.com/evolution-low-code-platforms/  
Low-code platforms, a concept first identified in 2014 by Forrester, could be the solution to these challenges. The term low-code emphasizes that these platforms enable the development of software systems with a low effort of coding. They target the citizen developer, professionals without specific software development training, through the introduction of higher-level abstractions such as domain-specific models. An ongoing discussion is if low-code platforms are novel. Are they a rebrand of model-driven development? Or a mixture of model-driven and other techniques? Or do they represent something new? I argue that while from a technology perspective they do not offer something new, the target and focus of low-code platforms is different from model-driven in general.

**No code**  
https://adactio.com/journal/19370  
I’m taking the term at face value to mean a mechanism for creating a website—preferably on a domain you control—without having to write anything in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, or any back-end programming language.

**We need young programmers; we need old programmers**  
https://blog.ploeh.dk/2020/09/14/we-need-young-programmers-we-need-old-programmers/  
We need young people in the software development industry. Because of their vigour and inexperience, they'll push the envelope. Most will fail to do the impossible, but a few succeed. This may seem like a cynical view, but we've all been young, and most of us have been through such a phase. It's like a rite of passage, and even if you fail to make your mark on the world, you're still likely to have learned a lot. We need old people because they're in a position to speak truth to the world. Notice that I didn't make my argument about the experience of old-timers. Actually, I find that valuable as well, but that's the ordinary argument: Listen to old people, because they have experience and wisdom.

**Why (and How) I Write Code With Pencil and Paper**

If the thought of handwriting code seems silly, it might surprise you to know that it’s inevitable. If you’re unsure, think about the last job interview you did, and remember how there was no computer around in the interview room — just your interviewers, a blank sheet of paper, and a blue ball-point pen.

**游牧教室的数字文具盒：主体为本，舒适第一**

题目中提到的「游牧教室」是个人文训练项目，我有若干学生，分别在不同地区，定期在线上或线下参加一个钟头的读书指导课。「游牧教室」所用到的数字文具盒当中，既会有跟训练方法关联较深因而也较为少见的特殊工具，也会有普通教师、学生、知识工作者日常也会触及的常规装备。下面先讲通用的部分：

创造知识地图是一个提醒，用来提醒我们学习知识的内容和理解知识的结构一样重要，而我们往往追求前者而忽略了后者。在这个过程中不需要完美，更不需要有「设计」能力 （这也是我一直很反对所谓的华而不实的视觉笔记的原因），重要的是将不同的知识元素连接在一起思考，而不是发到朋友圈获赞。
