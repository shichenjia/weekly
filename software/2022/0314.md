https://nodesource.com/blog/new-JavaScript-era-coming  
This proposal aims to enable developers to add type annotations to their JavaScript code, allowing those annotations to be checked by a type checker that is external to JavaScript. At runtime, a JavaScript engine ignores them, treating the types as comments.

**How to Upgrade to the React 18 Release Candidate**  
https://reactjs.org/blog/2022/03/08/react-18-upgrade-guide.html  
React 18 introduces features powered by our new concurrent renderer, with a gradual adoption strategy for existing applications. In this post, we will guide you through the steps for upgrading to React 18. Releated: [Automatic batching support in React 18](https://www.dtreelabs.com/blog/automatic-batching-support-in-react-18)

**WebGPU — All of the cores, none of the canvas**  
https://surma.dev/things/webgpu/  
WebGPU is an upcoming Web API that gives you low-level, general-purpose access GPUs. I am not very experienced with graphics. I picked up bits and bobs of WebGL by reading through tutorials on how to build game engines with OpenGL and learned more about shaders by watching Inigo Quilez do amazing things on ShaderToy by just using shaders, without any 3D meshes or models. This got me far enough to do build things like the background animation in PROXX, but I was never comfortable with WebGL, and I’ll explain shortly why.

**Algorithms for Modern Hardware**  
https://en.algorithmica.org/hpc/  
This is an upcoming high performance computing book titled “Algorithms for Modern Hardware” by Sergey Slotin. Its intended audience is everyone from performance engineers and practical algorithm researchers to undergraduate computer science students who have just finished an advanced algorithms course and want to learn more practical ways to speed up a program than by going from O(nlogn) to O(nloglogn).

**Agile Principles: Adaptive Self-Organizing**  
https://www.simplethread.com/agile-principles-11-adaptive-self-organizing/  
The idea of self-organizing teams is at the very heart of Simple Thread. Justin and I started the company as two senior engineers envisioning a place where we’d want to work. What types of clients would we work with? What technologies would we use? What architectures? What UX tools? How would our engineers and designers work together? And so on. In many ways, Simple Thread is the logical extension of a self-organizing team.

**Who says HTML and CSS aren’t real programming? (Ep. 421)**  
https://stackoverflow.blog/2022/03/08/the-new-stack-overflow-podcast-ep-421/  
https://briefs.video/videos/is-html-a-programming-language/  
Welcome to the new Stack Overflow podcast. For our relaunch episode, the home team covers code scanning for security vulnerabilities in open-source registries, whether high-profile skills training programs from Google and Amazon really address systemic inequity in tech (spoiler: probably not), and how a James Bond character sparked Matt’s interest in security.

**The HTML `<meter>` element and its (undefined) segment boundaries**  
https://www.ctrl.blog/entry/html-meter-segment-boundaries.html  
I recently found a use for the `<meter>` element: an element to represent a scalar measurement within a known range. (That’s the unappealing language the HTML Standard uses to describe a horizontal gauge bar.) However, I was dismayed to discover that different web browsers have vastly different interpretations of a vaguely defined aspect of the `<meter>` element. Here’s what I found and the workaround to get the same behavior in all browsers.
	
**Applying Product Thinking to Slack’s Internal Compute Platform**  
https://slack.engineering/applying-product-thinking-to-slacks-internal-compute-platform/  
According to a recent Thoughtworks radar, “the industry is increasingly gaining experience with platform engineering product teams that create and support internal platforms.” They caveated this with a piece of advice: “When creating a platform, it’s critical to have clearly defined customers and products that will benefit from it rather than building in a vacuum.”

**Coda’s ritual of innovation: How we created (almost) 100 Packs in one day**  
https://blog.coda.io/codas-ritual-of-innovation-how-we-created-almost-100-packs-in-one-day-7f7c0a4dbffb  
We recently created (almost) 100 Packs in one day and had a lot of fun doing so.
Here at Coda, we celebrate maker culture — we believe that, with the right tools, everyone can be a maker. Quarterly Hackathons are a central part of that culture for us. And 75% of our best ideas come from Hackathons, including Packs, charts, reactions, and dark mode. (If you want to learn more about this important innovation ritual or want help running your own Hackathon, check out my Hackathon guide.)

**Why does Google get internationalization wrong?**  
https://smaller.fish/posts/language  
And yet, in the alternate reality that we all live in, if you take your laptop from one country to another then suddenly some websites will start serving you content in a different language, based solely on your location having changed. This shouldn’t happen, since the language preferences in your browser haven’t changed when you entered the new country. While clearly there is a general correlation between average audience language and location, it is not true to say that location equals language. It is in fact a fallacy to make that assumption.

**空降，是组织的一场试炼**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/pWuok4sqzGd6vqZmWlkehw  
一个初创公司，刚刚起步，往往只有30%基础，剩下70%呢？任由经理人发挥。自己根基不稳，就随时可能被撼动。而我们常说，一家成熟的公司，应该有70%是基础，只有30%允许经理人发挥。基础，也就是底盘，要占70%，才会稳。把不能变的，像价值观、基本的保障公平的制度，等等，放入基础框架里。这样，你会感觉到，每个空降兵（经理人）来，风格确实不一样，对公司也有影响，但他们不会对公司有颠覆性的改变。可以创新，可以降本增效，但无法撼动大盘。这才是成熟的公司，该有的样子。

**世界的真实格局分析，地球人类社会底层运行原理**

有时候也读读卢克文和其他一些世界格局分析的文章，事例很生动，但总感觉缺少些什么。很小的时候，就特别关心世界，关心社会的组成，很想知道为什么?好多事情百思不得其解，在接触越来越多的信息越来越多的人后，好奇心的驱使下让我不断的探索每一件事情的答案，竟然发现：它们都是一个事情：人类生物属性的荷尔蒙决定人类的底层追求，国家上层建筑只是国家人民利益的集中体现，世界格局的形成，国家与国家之间的合纵连横不过是每个国家大众人民思维方式的自然结合，不可阻挡。
