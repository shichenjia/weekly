**Don’t worry, Nobody is Replacing Node, not Even Bun and Even less Deno**  
https://blog.bitsrc.io/dont-worry-nobody-is-replacing-node-js-not-even-bun-and-even-less-deno-4e7148cff78  
Let’s face it once and for all, Node is here to stay for a long time

**We Don't Need Faster Frameworks, We Need Better Tooling**  
https://alexkondov.com/we-need-better-tooling/  
New projects are coming out in quantities not that different from the frameworks during the notorious JavaScript fatigue. SWC and esbuild are trying to replace Webpack, while Bun and Deno are racing to fix the flaws in Node. But it won’t be enough until we get a tool like Vite or Rome, that manages to encompass the whole toolchain and hide it behind a simple API.Because much like we needed an abstraction over the DOM to work productively, we also need an abstraction over our tools.

**Developers as an audience is a hard sell – part one “developers are influencers”**  
https://christianheilmann.com/2022/09/26/developers-as-an-audience-is-a-hard-sell-part-one-developers-are-influencers/  
When I wrote the developer advocacy handbook and advertised my new role as “Developer Evangelist” to my company one of the main points I made was how developers are an incredibly important audience for any company to covet. Not only do they build your own products, they are also influencers for other people. 

**The Hundred-Year Programming Language**  
http://codefol.io/posts/the-hundred-year-programming-language/  
A certain kind of software developer—or more often, businessperson— likes to talk about a hundred-year programming language, or even a hundred-year framework.

**激荡二十年：HTTP API 的变迁**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/9TAYgS74yVdNmjduRycy4A  
过去二十年，API 的发展从无序走向有序，从自由发挥走向遵循协议，从无拘无束走向谨遵类型安全，每一次进化都让 API 从构建到部署到退休的整个生命周期变得更加成熟，同时 API 撰写的难度和所需要的技巧都在不断下降，自动化程度不断上升。然而，就像金庸武侠的最高境界是「无招胜有招」一样，无论API 代码再如何简洁，只要代码在那里，就会有无穷尽的成本，因此，最好的 API 系统是不用撰写一行代码就能提供服务的 API 系统。

**Optimize long tasks**  
https://web.dev/optimize-long-tasks/  
You've been told to "don't block the main thread" and "break up your long tasks", but what does it mean to do those things?

**Get in Zoomer, We're Saving React**  
https://acko.net/blog/get-in-zoomer-we-re-saving-react/  
Lately, it seems popular to talk smack about React. Both the orange and red site recently spilled the tea about how mean Uncle React has been, and how much nicer some of these next-gen frameworks supposedly are.

**How to Create Wavy Shapes & Patterns in CSS**  
https://css-tricks.com/how-to-create-wavy-shapes-patterns-in-css/  
The wave is probably one of the most difficult shapes to make in CSS. We always try to approximate it with properties like border-radius and lots of magic numbers until we get something that feels kinda close. And that’s before we even get into wavy patterns, which are more difficult.

**100 Days Of More Or Less Modern CSS**  
https://www.matuzo.at/blog/2022/100-days-of-more-or-less-modern-css/  
It’s time to get me up on speed with modern CSS. There’s so much new in CSS that I know too little about. To change that I’ve started #100DaysOfMoreOrLessModernCSS. Why more or less modern CSS? Because some topics will be about cutting-edge features, while other stuff has been around for quite a while already, but I just have little to no experience with it.

**node_modules: How one character saved 50 GB of disk space**  
https://mainmatter.com/blog/2022/09/29/pnpm/  
Have you ever worked with JavaScript? Have you been annoyed by the three hundred copies of left-pad in all of the node_modules folders on your disk? Would you prefer if all of your projects shared their node_modules folders instead of each getting their own copy? If you answered these questions with "Hell, yeah!" then this blog post is for you!

**From Development to Real Users: How to Create a Web Performance Story**  
https://engineering.atspotify.com/2022/09/from-development-to-real-users-how-to-create-a-web-performance-story/  
Some of the most common questions asked when it comes to work with performance are, How do you convince stakeholders that improving the performance of your project is actually worth the investment? How can you prove that the work is necessary to begin with? Or prove that you have shipped improvements? And what is the impact of certain changes on users in different scenarios?

**Regulate web3 apps, not protocols**  
https://a16zcrypto.com/web3-regulation-apps-not-protocols/  
The first generation of the web gave us incredible tools in the form of networking, data exchange, email, and file transfer protocols, all of which made it possible to move information at the speed of the internet. Web3 makes it possible for the transfer of value to occur at that speed, with lending and asset exchange already being available as native functions of this new internet. This is an incredible public good that must be protected. As web3 expands from decentralized finance, or “DeFi,” to video games, social media, creator economies, and gig economies, regulation that creates a level playing field across these sectors will become even more critical. Weighing all the factors, the right approach becomes readily apparent. Apps ought to be regulated, not protocols.

**Why Modern Software is Slow–Windows Voice Recorder**  
https://randomascii.wordpress.com/2022/09/29/why-modern-software-is-slow-windows-voice-recorder/  
I apologize for this title because there are many things that can make modern software slow. Blindly applying one explanation without a bit of investigation is the software equivalent of a cargo cult. That said, this post describes one example of why modern software can be painfully slow.

**Prompt engineering is hard**  
https://xeiaso.net/blog/prompt-engineering  
I've seen a lot of comments on Twitter that seem to completely misunderstand the process of getting a decent result with AI generators like Stable Diffusion and DALL-E 2. People seem to assume that it's just "push button, recieve bacon" without any real creativity in the equation. As someone who has done a lot of this experimentation in the past few months, I'd like to challenge that assertion and show you what the process for getting a decent result actually involves.

**Learning is Remembering**  
https://saveall.ai/blog/learning-is-remembering  
Many also know deep down that forgetting is a major problem but don't want to acknowledge it. They'd rather convince themselves it's fine to forget 90% of what they learn than face the thought that it's holding them back and they can't do doing anything about it. Well, new technologies leveraging techniques like spaced repetition mean it's much easier to remember what you learn so its time to rethink that. You don't have to forget what you learn anymore.

**Get Things Done with Emacs**  
https://www.labri.fr/perso/nrougier/GTD/index.html  
Before I start describing how I organize my professional life using Emacs and org-mode, let me introduce myself. I'm a researcher in computational neuroscience working at the Institute of Neurodegenerative Diseases in Bordeaux (France). As such, my main tasks during a typical day are meetings with my PhD students (physical or online), team and grant meetings (physical or online), development (GitHub), reading (online), reviewing (online) and writing (books, papers, grants, notes, etc).
