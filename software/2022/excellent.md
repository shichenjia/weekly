**Why products should be “slick”, not just viable**  
https://herman.bearblog.dev/mvp-vs-slc/  
I hate the term MVP. Over the past decade, it’s been overused and misunderstood to the point where something labeled as an MVP is automatically assumed to be pretty shit. Most MVPs are unfortunately too M to be V, and the culture of “ship it while you’re embarrassed by it” tends to lead to products providing users with an embarrassingly bad experience. The problem is that your users hate MVPs.

**A clean start for the web**  
https://macwright.com/2020/08/22/clean-starts-for-the-web.html  
The web is in need of some reinvention right now. The web’s evolution over the last decade has mirrored the American economy. All of the essential indicators are going “up and to the right,” a steady stream of fundamental advances reassure us that there “is progress,” but the actual experience and effects for individuals stagnates or regresses.

**Introducing arun.is 2.0**  
https://www.arun.is/blog/arun-is-2-0/  
https://www.arun.is/blog/inside-arun-is-writing/  
Today, I’m announcing the most significant set of improvements to this website since I started it in 2016. I hope this redesign can serve me for another five years or more. If I succeed, I can incrementally add to the system without going to the drawing board again. I still have a long list of potential improvements like search, performance gains, interactive components, etc. They’ll provide plenty of fodder for future weekends of hacking.

**用了十年，你真的看懂朋友圈了吗？**  
http://www.geekpark.net/news/301104  
十年过去，朋友圈本身确实「没怎么变」。今天发布一条朋友圈，或者刷朋友圈的体验，和十年前没有什么本质的区别。从更新频率也能看出变化很小——过去十年，微信日志中关于朋友圈的更新只有 15 条，最近一次停留在 2018 年。但是十年里，朋友圈也「改变」了很多。十年前，我们关心一个人的近况，是打电话嘘寒问暖，而今天不少人的第一选择，是翻一下他/她的朋友圈；十年前，我们表达对一个公共议题的关注，是拉上几个好友青梅煮酒，而今天则是转发一条朋友圈；甚至最近，一个 HR 朋友聊天时和我说，现在了解候选人的性格，加一下微信翻翻他的朋友圈，已经成为 HR 的「基操」…… 今天是朋友圈十岁的生日，值得聊一聊朋友圈的「变与不变」，以及这些细节背后微信团队可能是怎么想的。

**写给想用代码建造新世界的你**  
https://sspai.com/post/72729  
Hello 下一个程序员 a.k.a. 新的上帝！摆在你面前的是一份诱惑：100 小时后，代码能让你成为一个新世界的主宰。很多时候，世界不是你想要的样子。你的生活里，有多少无解的难题；你的工作掌控你，而不是你获得满足感的工具。如果你愿意从现在开始尝试编程，你的条件总不会比盲人更差；如果你在犹豫起步是不是已经比 10 岁的神童晚太多，至少 81 岁还和你相距甚远。

**10 Things I (Still) Love About Programming**  
https://www.simplethread.com/10-things-i-still-love-about-programming/  
This post was inspired by my cofounder Justin’s post on [20 Things I’ve Learned in my 20 Years as a Software Engineer](https://www.simplethread.com/20-things-ive-learned-in-my-20-years-as-a-software-engineer/). I don’t have much to add to that list, but reading through those items, I found myself thinking of all the things I still love about software engineering, even after doing it for 20 years. I’ve included 10 items below that still bring me joy.

**Innovating beyond libraries and frameworks**  
https://nilsnh.no/2022/04/09/innovating-beyond-libraries-and-frameworks/  
I believe we should look beyond libraries and frameworks and rediscover the value of patterns and principles, and I’d argue that it would lead us to have less breaking changes and add more longevity to the stuff we build. I have been a big fan of the [write libraries, not frameworks](https://www.brandons.me/blog/libraries-not-frameworks) argument for a while now. Lately, I’ve come to ponder that there might be a fruitful expansion to this argument, that we should start to value principles over patterns, patterns over libraries, and libraries over frameworks.

**Stabilize, Modularize, Modernize: Scaling Slack’s Mobile Codebases**  
https://slack.engineering/stabilize-modularize-modernize-scaling-slacks-mobile-codebases-2/  
https://slack.engineering/stabilize-modularize-modernize-scaling-slacks-mobile-codebases/  
In the first post about the Duplo initiative, we discussed the reasons for launching a project to revamp Slack’s mobile codebases, and what we accomplished in Duplo’s initial Stabilization phase. This post will explore modularization, and then there will be a third post to describe how we modernized our codebase and the overall results of the project.

**Transitional Architecture**  
https://martinfowler.com/articles/patterns-legacy-displacement/transitional-architecture.html  
Software elements installed to ease the displacement of a legacy system that we intend to remove when the displacement is complete.

**In defense of simple architectures**  
https://danluu.com/simple-architectures/  
Wave is a $1.7B company with 70 engineers1 whose product is a CRUD app that adds and subtracts numbers. In keeping with this, our architecture is a standard CRUD app architecture, a Python monolith on top of Postgres. Starting with a simple architecture and solving problems in simple ways where possible has allowed us to scale to this size while engineers mostly focus on work that delivers value to users. Stackoverflow scaled up a monolith to good effect (2013 architecture / 2016 architecture), eventually getting acquired for $1.8B.

**Remix: The Yang to React's Yin**  
https://kentcdodds.com/blog/remix-the-yang-to-react-s-yin  
React's tagline is: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. And it does a terrific job at that. React has never promised "network chasm management," but every web application needs it. With Remix managing that network chasm, we finally have a yang to React's yin. With a great rendering library and a super network chasm manager, you can build better, faster web applications with fewer bugs, simpler code, and more fun.

**Mozilla’s vision for the evolution of the Web**  
https://webvision.mozilla.org/full/  
Mozilla's mission is to ensure that the Internet is a global public resource, open and accessible to all. We believe in an Internet that puts people first, where individuals can shape their own experience and are empowered, safe, and independent. The Web is an enormous asset to humanity and Mozilla is committed to protecting it and making it better. [..] we believe that we can all work together as a community to make a Web that is truly open and accessible to all.

**反思软件开发：软件本身**  
https://ourai.ws/posts/rethink-software/  
软件是现实世界的映射，通过二进制理论上可以完美复刻现实世界，充满无限可能，但依赖且受限于人们的认知与现实中的条件；对人们的正常生存、生活来说软件不是必需的，软件的存在是为了让人们变得更好；软件提供者不应为了一己私利去恶意利用人性，对用户和社会造成负面影响。回到开头提到的「技术服务于业务」和「你做的事情有什么业务价值」，这两句话实际在说——要先从业务领域和用户需求中分析出问题的确切所在，再根据问题的性质、特点等制定解决方案——毋庸置疑，技术方案是其中的一部分。

**是什么造成了中国软件产业的悲剧**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/O8klxfWDcGqG1E1TUjyjUg  
经历了这么多年的风风雨雨，作为中国软件的从业者，我常常在思考，为什么中国的软件产业还是很低端，并没有太多的优秀的软件问世，反而我们的邻国俄罗斯，最近这二十年完全无法和中国的经济发展相比较，但在软件行业里，前有大家基本上无法离开的 Nginx，后有现在已经大规模被使用中的 Clickhouse，这些都是有能力影响全世界的产品。中国的软件产业虽然也有长足的发展，但现实中，我们没有真正意义上的软件巨头型企业，大量基础软件被外国垄断，这究竟是为什么呢？

**A career ending mistake**  
https://bitfieldconsulting.com/golang/career  
By “the end”, I don't necessarily mean picking your retirement date. What we're really talking about is the aim or goal of your career. Where will you be when you realise that this is where you've always wanted to be? If you love what you're doing now and don't ever want to change jobs, great: you've reached the end of your career, even if it plays out over many decades. If you don't love it, and that's much more likely, then it's worth asking what would make you feel that way, and when it's going to happen. So, where do you want to end up? And is that where you're currently heading? If not, what should you do about it?

**Thoughts On Markdown**  
https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2022/02/thoughts-on-markdown/  
Markdown in all its flavors, interpretations, and forks won’t go away. However, it’s important to look at emerging content formats that try to encompass modern needs. In this article, Knut shares his advice against Markdown by looking back on why it was introduced in the first place, and by going through some of the major developments of content on the web.

**What are the Most Important Statistical Ideas of the Past 50 Years?**  
https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01621459.2021.1938081  
We review the most important statistical ideas of the past half century, which we categorize as: counterfactual causal inference, bootstrapping and simulation-based inference, overparameterized models and regularization, Bayesian multilevel models, generic computation algorithms, adaptive decision analysis, robust inference, and exploratory data analysis. We discuss key contributions in these subfields, how they relate to modern computing and big data, and how they might be developed and extended in future decades. The goal of this article is to provoke thought and discussion regarding the larger themes of research in statistics and data science.

2022 年已经到来，我们是时候反思 Web 开发中的种种过时软件、炒作歪曲和荒谬趋势了。把握这一年，我们也该重新专注于性能与技术运用，把手段和目的重新统一起来。当然，我不是劝大家用汇编或者 C 语言搞 Web 开发，但关于 JavaScript、Ruby on Rails、Python、Django 以及 PHP 框架的疯狂观点也该消停一下了。另附：[Have Single-Page Apps Ruined the Web? | Transitional Apps with Rich Harris, NYTimes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=860d8usGC0o)。
