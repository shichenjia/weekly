**玉伯的产品思考：技术人如何做产品**  
https://www.yuque.com/yuque/blog/kyet95  
技术人除了做技术还能做什么？我想很多人都想过这个话题。 其中的一个答案是「做产品」，因为，每个技术人心目中都会有一个产品梦。今天想跟大家聊一下这个话题：技术人如何做产品，谈谈我在做产品的过程中的一些感受。

**The Forty-Year Programmer**  
https://codefol.io/posts/the-forty-year-programmer/  
I’m not going to tell you what language or framework to learn. If you’re good at the basics you can learn anything you want. Until then, you can be bad at whichever one you want. That’s what I did, anyway. Instead I’ll talk about things that didn’t make sense to me when I started, and now they’re the guiding stars in my sky. That means it’s not about specific technologies. Technologies come and go. Languages come and go. They can’t be your sky. Let’s start with this: software is young. Releated: [30 thoughts on turning 30](https://herman.bearblog.dev/turning-30/).

**Less is more agile**  
https://beny23.github.io/posts/my_take_on_engineering_room_9/  
https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32706548  
Software Engineers have a habit of forgetting the simplicity of agile. All too often are solutions sought in process and technology, when the first thought should echoing the manifesto’s “people over process”. That means talking to people - be that users of the software, stakeholders, team members or colleagues from different teams. The simple solutions are often the most efficient, and that extends to not thinking “We can write a software tool for that” when a few Post-It notes are sufficient.

**Research: quantifying GitHub Copilot’s impact on developer productivity and happiness**  
https://github.blog/2022-09-07-research-quantifying-github-copilots-impact-on-developer-productivity-and-happiness/  
When the GitHub Copilot Technical Preview launched just over one year ago, we wanted to know one thing: Is this tool helping developers? The GitHub Next team conducted research using a combination of surveys and experiments, which led us to expected and unexpected answers.

**Rewriting tests from Cypress to Playwright using GPT3**  
https://contra.com/p/PWBcPYZc-rewriting-tests-from-cypress-to-playwright-using-gpt-3  
Cypress and @playwright/test are two competing integration testing frameworks. We have been using Cypress for a long time but recently made a decision to migrate our Cypress tests to Playwright, all 400 of them. It is absolutely worth it for the speed and reliability gains (a future post)... However, it meant a lot of manual work! Or so I thought...

**Article Series: Continuous Architecture**  
https://www.infoq.com/articles/continous-architecture-article-series/  
In this series of articles, we reframe software architecture in terms of decisions that teams make about how their system will handle its quality attribute requirements (QARs). QARs include things like scalability, security, performance, throughput, sustainability, and the like - things that the system must achieve beyond the functional requirements that it must satisfy. Looking at the code can give a reasonable picture of how the system satisfies its functional requirements, but how it meets its QARs is far more subtle, even hidden. In our view, software architecture, reframed in terms of decisions, completes the picture of how the system works by making clear the choices that the team has made, and why.

**Preact: Introducing Signals**  
https://preactjs.com/blog/introducing-signals/  
Signals are a way of expressing state that ensure apps stay fast regardless of how complex they get. Signals are based on reactive principles and provide excellent developer ergonomics, with a unique implementation optimized for Virtual DOM.

**The 100% Markdown Expedition**  
https://hacks.mozilla.org/2022/09/the-100-percent-markdown-expedition/  
In June 2021, we decided to start converting the source code for MDN web docs from HTML into a format that would be easier for us to work with. The goal was to get 100% of our manually-written documentation converted to Markdown, and we really had a mountain of source code to climb for this particular expedition. In this post, we’ll describe why we decided to migrate to Markdown, and the steps you can take that will help us on our mission.

**Critical CSS? Not So Fast!**  
https://csswizardry.com/2022/09/critical-css-not-so-fast/  
I have long held very strong opinions about the Critical CSS pattern. In theory, in a perfect world, with all things being equal, it’s demonstrably a Good Idea™. However, in practice, in the real world, it often falls short as a fragile and expensive technique to implement, which seldom provides the benefits that many developers expect.

**My Blog is Hilariously Overengineered to the Point People Think it's a Static Site**  
https://xeiaso.net/talks/how-my-website-works  
Speed. Safety. Development experience. Fearless concurrency. These are all things that you associate with programs written in Rust. How about some more buzzwords? Words like elegant? That's a good one. I'm Xe Iaso and I'm going to share the gory details on how my blog works, and why people often mistake it for a static website. Buckle up and kick back, we're going to learn about the internet today.

**Three Developer Mistakes: Schema Design**  
https://www.singlestore.com/blog/three-developer-mistakes-schema-design/  
Modern tech stacks require developers to juggle several different parts of their application: frontend UI, orchestration, APIs and the database.

**Vulnerability Management for Go**  
https://go.dev/blog/vuln  
We are excited to announce Go’s new support for vulnerability management, our first step towards helping Go developers learn about known vulnerabilities that may affect them. This post provides an overview of what’s available today and next steps for this project.

**Viewing the world as a computer: Global capacity management**  
https://engineering.fb.com/2022/09/06/data-center-engineering/viewing-the-world-as-a-computer-global-capacity-management/ Meta currently operates 14 data centers around the world. This rapidly expanding global data center footprint poses new challenges for service owners and for our infrastructure management systems. Systems like Twine, which we use to scale cluster management, and RAS, which handles perpetual region-wide resource allocation, have provided the abstractions and automation necessary for service owners to be machine-agnostic within a region. However, as we expand our number of data center regions, we need new approaches to global service and capacity management. That’s why we’ve created new systems, called Global Reservations Service and Regional Fluidity, that determine the best placement for a service based on intent, needs, and current congestion.

**A bug that was 23 years old or not**  
https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2022/09/05/a-bug-that-was-23-years-old-or-not/  
This is a tale of cookies, Internet code and a CVE. It goes back a long time so please take a seat, lean back and follow along. The scene is of course curl, the internet transfer tool and library I work on.

**Novelty fallacy: why new isn’t always better**  
https://nesslabs.com/novelty-fallacy  
The most recent smartphone, the latest tool, the hottest trend… Humans are naturally attracted to novelty, whether it’s new objects or new ideas. In the modern world, our desire to be on the cutting edge of technology only exacerbates the appeal of adopting the newest innovations. However, there is danger in blindly embracing something new without first examining it with a critical eye. This is known as the novelty fallacy, also known as the novelty bias.

**Biomanufactured materials are coming**  
https://www.tsungxu.com/performance-biomaterials/  
This article is Part Two in a two part series about materials. [Part One](https://www.tsungxu.com/materials-paradigm/) outlined a case on why we need a new materials paradigm. This piece dives into amazing new performance materials leading this seismic shift, how many of them have underpinnings in synthetic biology and how startups can use these materials to engineer products we've never had before.

**The Doing Thinking Flywheel**  
https://herbertlui.net/the-doing-thinking-flywheel/  
In this conceptual model, the Doing Thinking Flywheel, doing and thinking feed each other. Sometimes, a thought can cause an action; other times, an action can cause a thought. New insights emerge from action, doing, and execution. This is how professional artists practice their creative processes; as influential artist Chuck Close says, “Inspiration is for amateurs—the rest of us just show up and get to work.

**作为学校管理者，最应重视一切可能影响教师积极性的事情**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/A46KQbmyMb13x5LQhoMBXg  
新一代的需求并非依据马斯洛需求层次理论从底层开始的，而是从看重顶层，他们要实现自我价值。在这样一个飞速发展的时代里，自我实现已经不再是顶峰。能不能自我实现之后，进一步超越自我，打破自己，把自己清零，重新开始，这将是未来的一个新的挑战。正是因为这些原因，对未来的认识、对未来教育的判断，全世界各个国家从来也没有像今天这样趋向一致。如新加坡“21世纪素养”的框架中，把核心价值观放在正中央，把充满自信的人、主动学习的人、积极奉献的人放在中间。

**是你吗？守护神州的华夏水神**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/IQYhuUNGkY738Gk8Jb_-pg  
最近这段时间，蜀地江边的一座千年石像再次引起网络热议。有人说这石像原本为纪念大禹的塑像，只是后来被改头换面了，成了现在的样子。有人说，官方历史记载着清清楚楚，开凿于开元元年（713年），完工于唐德宗贞元十九年（803年），是经史书认证过的，没什么好争议的。
在直接证据不那么充分的情况下，真正的历史究竟是什么样子的呢？我们不妨从考古遗址、民俗传统与历史记载中去找寻一些蛛丝马迹吧。现在学界普遍认为，把天下划分为九州的《禹贡》成熟于战国时期，虽托名大禹，却并非大禹亲著。然而华夏九州的形成，却与大禹有着深刻的关联，华夏民族最早的大洪水记忆，就与大禹有关。如果这个世界。
