> Leaving the cloud & Moving From React to htmx & Node.js 19 & AI will replace middle management

## 本周热点

**Why we're leaving the cloud**  
https://world.hey.com/dhh/why-we-re-leaving-the-cloud-654b47e0  
Basecamp has had one foot in the cloud for well over a decade, and HEY has been running there exclusively since it was launched two years ago. We've run extensively in both Amazon's cloud and Google's cloud. We've run on bare virtual machines, we've run on Kubernetes. We've seen all the cloud has to offer, and tried most of it. It's finally time to conclude: Renting computers is (mostly) a bad deal for medium-sized companies like ours with stable growth. The savings promised in reduced complexity never materialized. So we're making our plans to leave. Related: [Why we’re moving away from Firebase](https://koptional.com/article/why-we%E2%80%99re-moving-away-from-firebase).

**Moving From React to htmx**  
https://htmx.org/essays/a-real-world-react-to-htmx-port/  
We took the plunge and replaced the 2-year-of-work React UI of our SaaS product with simple Django templates and htmx in a couple of months. We’d like to share our experience with you, with concrete indicators on various aspects, and convince your CTO!

**Node.js 19 is now available!**  
https://nodejs.org/en/blog/announcements/v19-release-announce/  
We’re excited to announce that Node.js 19 was released today! Highlights include the update of the V8 JavaScript engine to 10.7, and HTTP(s)/1.1 KeepAlive enabled by default. Node.js 19 will replace Node.js 18 as our ‘Current’ release line when Node.js 18 enters long-term support (LTS) later this month. As per the release schedule, Node.js 19 will be the ‘Current' release for the next 6 months, until April 2023.

**In-depth Guide to API Management: Benefits & Use Cases**  
https://research.aimultiple.com/api-management/  
APIs have become one of the essential tools for software ecosystems, offering means to promote innovation both within and outside of an organization. It is estimated that 90% of developers rely on APIs. As APIs become more prevalent, API management is becoming crucial. This article explores what API management is, its components, benefits and use cases.

**AI will replace middle management before robots replace hourly workers**  
https://chatterhead.bearblog.dev/ai-will-replace-middle-management-not-hourly-workers/  
Artificial Intelligence is now capable of beating the best humans at chess 100% of the time no questions asked. The Roomba in the corner of my room still gets stuck on things and runs out of power. Which of these two technologies do you think will impact corporate America the most; robots that must be built by robots to perform a specific task once done by a person, or a program capable of making the best possible business decision given historic and currently available data? If you said the latter you're correct. The "robot revolution" is not coming first; the AI decision making paradigm shift will and it is going to save corporations billions of dollars in salary costs per year as middle management disappears.

**Style performance and concurrent rendering**  
https://nolanlawson.com/2022/10/22/style-performance-and-concurrent-rendering/  
I was fascinated recently by “[Why we’re breaking up with CSS-in-JS](https://dev.to/srmagura/why-were-breaking-up-wiht-css-in-js-4g9b)” by Sam Magura. It’s a great overview of some of the benefits and downsides of the “CSS-in-JS” pattern, as implemented by various libraries in the React ecosystem. What really piqued my curiosity, though, was a link to this guide by Sebastian Markbåge on potential performance problems with CSS-in-JS when using concurrent rendering, a new feature in React 18.

**Futuristic CSS**  
https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2022/10/futuristic-css/  
In this article, Sacha Greif tries to anticipate future CSS trends and takes a look at some far-fetched and futuristic CSS features that might one day make their way to the browser.

**CSS Halftone Patterns**  
https://css-irl.info/css-halftone-patterns/  
A little while ago, Ana Tudor created an impressive collection of halftone patterns using only CSS. As I had a little time to spare, I thought I’d dig into the code and see how it was done! Ana’s demos are made using Sass — what better way to learn than to try to produce similar effects using vanilla CSS?

**The programming challenge that is a modern browser**  
https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/web/BrowserProgrammingChallenge  
Writing and maintaining a modern browser is probably one of the most challenging programming projects you could ask for; it has to deal with inherently hard problems and a large scale.

**The Go WebAssembly ABI at a Low Level**  
https://xeiaso.net/talks/wasm-abi  
The Go 1.11 release in mid-2018 added support for compiling Go to WebAssembly. It allows you to take a reasonable subset of Go programs and run them in browsers alongside JavaScript. I'm Xe Iaso and today I'm going to help you understand how this works and the amazingly terrible hacks that power the core of this. This talk is aimed at intermediate to expert audiences, it will likely hit best if you have some familiarity with JavaScript and WebAssembly, and especially if you are a fan of amazingly terrible ideas. To make sure everyone is on the same page, I'm going to give background and context for everything as it is needed.

**What’s the Future of Python Development?**  
https://spin.atomicobject.com/2022/10/17/python-development/  
The main downside of Python is that it can be an incredibly slow programming language. Being an interpreted language, the Python interpreter must run through the program line by line to run rather than building the entire program before running. And, with the global interpreter lock preventing the interpretation from running on multiple threads, this performance impact can have a major effect on large applications. So if Python is so slow, why do so many people still use it? And, will newer languages eventually replace it? Let’s explore where Python is growing and where it is struggling.

**DevOps is Bullshit**  
https://blog.massdriver.cloud/devops-is-bullshit  
DevOps started as a well-intentioned set of practices and culture. Over the years, it has devolved into an unholy beast of division and tunnel vision. Why did we stop dreaming bigger? What happened to tearing down silos, increasing engineering velocity, and adding value? Remember? The things DevOps was supposed to do?

**How to Structure Your Data Team for Maximum Influence**  
https://shopify.engineering/how-to-structure-data-teams

Below, we’ll review these frameworks and their positives and negatives when applied to a data science team. We’ll also share the framework that’s worked best for empowering our data science teams to drive impact.

**How Trying New Programming Languages Helped Me Grow as a Software Engineer**  
https://cichocinski.dev/blog/trying-new-programming-languages-helped-grow-software-engineer  
When you use one programming language daily in your job as a Software Engineer, it's easy to fall into the trap of that language bubble. I want to show you how stepping outside your comfort zone and learning new languages and paradigms helped me grow as a Software Engineer.

**爱自己：为何**  
https://ourai.ws/posts/what-and-why-of-loving-yourself/  
在「爱自己，爱生活，爱他人」这三个「爱」中，「爱自己」体现了「欧雷流」的内敛性，而「爱生活」与「爱他人」则会逐渐体现出外放性。「爱自己」是对自己的尊重，也是对自己的约束，而不是对自己的放纵，其主要目的是让自己开心和让自己变强。虽然「爱自己」强调要重视自己的利益，将自己放在他人他物之上，但这不是自私自利，不是极端的个人主义，不会让人变得狭隘。如果每个人都像我说的那样「爱自己」，那么世界上的每个人都会过成自己想要的样子，呈现出缤纷灿烂的多元性；相互关心的人之间不会为对方担心，不给对方压力，各自安好。现在这个时代，应当是个体觉醒的时代，是开始追求精神财富而非物质财富的时代！
