**Fresh 1.0**  
https://deno.com/blog/fresh-is-stable  
Fresh is a new full stack web framework for Deno. By default, web pages built with Fresh send zero JavaScript to the client. The framework has no build step which allows for an order of magnitude improvement in deployment times. Today we are releasing the first stable version of Fresh.

My experience with a pioneering JavaScript framework.

**SPAs: theory versus practice**  
https://nolanlawson.com/2022/06/27/spas-theory-versus-practice/  
I think the core dilemma between SPAs and MPAs remains unresolved, and will maybe never be resolved. Both SPAs and MPAs have their strengths and weaknesses, and the right tool for the job will vary with the size and skills of the team and the product they’re trying to build. It will also vary over time, as browsers evolve. The important thing, I think, is to remain open-minded, skeptical, and analytical, and to accept that everything in software development has tradeoffs, and none of those tradeoffs are set in stone.

**Things You Should Know About Databases**  
https://architecturenotes.co/things-you-should-know-about-databases/  
This is the first post in a series called Things You Should Know. Think of it as a primer to set you from base principles on various topics. For example, today, we are discussing databases!

**An Engineer’s Best Tips for Writing Documentation Devs Love**

Among others things, Egger spent every Hacktoberfest contributing documentation, and Egger’s slide credits the staff of professional editors employed at DigitalOcean for giving him expert guidance. “If you’ve never seen or used DigitalOcean’s tutorials, they’re fantastic,” Egger told his audience. Indeed, at TNS, we’ve noticed how DigitalOcean’s docs are often much more comprehensible compared to those provided by the larger cloud providers on the same subjects. “There are a lot of great people there that taught me a lot about documentation. “And now I want to share that with you.”

**Apple Is Not Defending Browser Engine Choice**  
https://infrequently.org/2022/06/apple-is-not-defending-browser-engine-choice/  
As penance for this error, and for being short with Miguel, I must deconstruct the ways Apple has undermined browser engine diversity. Contrary to claims of Apple partisans, iOS engine restrictions are not preventing a "takeover" by Chromium — at least that's not the primary effect. Apple uses its power over browsers to strip-mine and sabotage the web, hurting all engine projects and draining the web of future potential.  

**The end of Internet Explorer**

What ending support for Internet Explorer meant for the customers and developers at Maersk.com.

**CSS排版为何强？瞧瞧多牛这换行**

CSS这门语言中有各种各样的CSS属性和值来专门处理与文字排版换行相关的需求

**团队专业建设观察与思考**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/vnKi5v_BwnaKbKfNVoLF1A  
多年来自己工作之一就是想办法将自己的专业积累赋能给团队。当专注与某一个方向探索的时候，总会积累一些个人的感悟和心得，这里就和大家讲讲这些东西。

**社区驱动开发：技术选型的另类浅析**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/fa8d17-gZdKIHxjuKPrvAg  
六月，在探索一些技术选型的发展趋势 —— 除了研究国内的技术趋势，也研究了一部分的国外技术趋势。当然，结果是显而易见的，国外的技术选型上，依旧还是比国内领先的。但是呢，国内也没有那么差，只是受限于基础不够扎实的原因，还处于追赶状态。为了简化大家的理解，我把这种选择趋势称之为：社区驱动开发。简单来说，就是技术社区上流行什么，那么这个区域就会流行什么。也是一种关于技术理念的竞争游戏

**The state of AWS Serverless Development**  
https://dev.to/aws-builders/the-state-of-aws-serverless-development-h5a  
The current problem is that people jump on the Serverless train without understanding what it takes. Many would say that Serverless needs a different mind shift or that it is much harder to learn because you need to connect all the services. I have found all of this not valid for someone like me, whom I have been around for a while and experienced both worlds.

**Effective vs. efficient: why you can choose both**  
https://blog.superhuman.com/effective-vs-efficient/  
When it comes to the efficient vs. effective argument, we don't think you should choose one over the other. Practice both! Businesses need efficiency and effectiveness in high amounts to derive the benefits and promote ongoing growth. This article will discuss efficiency and effectiveness and how to combine them to get the best results for your company.

**WebAssembly and C++**

As promised as a followup to my beginner's notes on WebAssembly, here are some notes on WebAssembly specifically around C/C++.

**Explaining Code using ASCII Art**  
https://blog.regehr.org/archives/1653  
People tend to be visual: we use pictures to understand problems. Mainstream programming languages, on the other hand, operate in an almost completely different kind of abstract space, leaving a big gap between programs and pictures. This piece is about pictures drawn using a text character set and then embedded in source code. I love these! The other day I asked around on Twitter for more examples and the responses far exceeded expectations (thanks everyone!). There are a ton of great examples in the thread; here I’ve categorized a few of them. Click on images go to the repositories

**Code Of Ethics**  
https://sqlite.org/codeofethics.html  
This document was originally called a "Code of Conduct" and was created for the purpose of filling in a box on "supplier registration" forms submitted to the SQLite developers by some clients. However, we subsequently learned that "Code of Conduct" has a very specific and almost sacred meaning to some readers, a meaning to which this document does not conform [1][2][3]. Therefore this document was renamed to "Code of Ethics", as we are encouraged to do by rule 71 in particular and also rules 2, 8, 9, 18, 19, 30, 66, and in the spirit of all the rest.

**Give Up GitHub: The Time Has Come!**

There are so many good reasons to give up on GitHub, and we list the major ones on our [Give Up On GitHub](https://sfconservancy.org/GiveUpGitHub/) site. We were already considering this action ourselves for some time, but last week's event showed that this action is overdue.

**Life Is Not Short**

The most surprising thing is that you wouldn’t let anyone steal your property, but you consistently let people steal your time, which is infinitely more valuable.

**Where Did the Long Tail Go?**

'The Long Tail' was supposed to boost alternative voices in music, movies, and books—but the exact opposite happened

**思维对了，沟通才能事半功倍**

不必马上令人领悟你；探讨不等于争辩；多人会话如何倾听别人；搞清集体讨论的意义。

**波谷**

启动小报童时，在杭州的山中，我曾跟少楠戏言：最差结果是什么？没有其它用户，就我们两人用。自己用用也蛮好。当然，这是一种极端假设。但当我能坦然接受最差结果，我就是不可战胜的。正如孙武的教诲，立于不败之地，然后再持续求胜。 这也是一种不对称性。因而也无执念，愿意尊重客观规律，更能保持诚实、实事求是。

**极少人能活出生命的光**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/qL8pyEu__cNYZ08sccI6Sw
生命的光，其实离我们并不远，就在生命的真滋味里。滋味，就是感受；感受你的感受，就是品味。道不是感受，但经由感受抵达和呈现的“真实”，则近道矣。品味这真滋味，即无异于发光，不异于如来放光。若能守住这真滋味，知道只往这里看，则人生不管如何，便皆是生命的道场，道场中安排了都并不重要。我说过，从没有好的东西与坏的东西，而只有你消化不了和消化得了的东西。能如此，就叫追寻和守护生命的光，直至修炼出自己的“光身”。光身，即是法身。

**下半年，加油！**

诗人说，望着窗外，只要想起一生后悔的事，梅花便落满了南山。给一生作结为时尚早，就说这翻过的上半年，你回头，身后“梅花”寥寥还是落了一地？若是称心，再接再厉！若是不甘，再拼一番！在七月第一天，先给自己打个气！拜拜上半年，2022下半年，你好！
