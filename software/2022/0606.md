**教育最大的危机，是教育质量支撑不了国家对创新的需求**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/pwpq_IGXKunHH0bNQNKIhg  
创新的力量由何而来？中国工程院院士、华东师范大学校长钱旭红教授在采访中谈到，创新的载体是创造性人才，核心是创造性思维的培养，思维教育应该超越知识和技能。钱旭红从老子思想的精妙，谈到量子理论的意义，古今相接，东西相融，让人感受到站在前沿探索事物发展本源的科学家，其思想的深邃和张力。当可以承载自己最深沉的思索，人的思想就带着光芒，通透、自由和清醒。钱旭红便是如此。采访间，光透过他背后的窗，折射进室内，宁静而温暖；窗外，绿叶随风轻摇，一片盎然。另附：[许纪霖：一流的学术成果不是项目、而是闲暇的产物](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/Joqgu85LRShapJOkW1Z1Dg)、[所有的管理都是知识管理](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/MxFa-_H2lxIxYSx67OWs0A)。

**The State of Serverless 2022**  
https://www.datadoghq.com/state-of-serverless/  
Serverless has transformed application development by eliminating the need to provision and manage any underlying infrastructure. The current serverless ecosystem has grown more mature, and it now has considerable overlap with the world of container-based technologies. The wide range of available options has led over half of organizations operating in each cloud to adopt serverless.

In short, when looking back over the last 13 years, Go’s creators believe the language succeeded by training its focus on “the overall environment” where software projects get engineered. “Go’s approach is to treat language features as no more important than environmental ones.” Releated: [What npm Can Learn from Go](https://engineering.hardfin.com/2022/05/npm-mod/), [Rust Is Hard, Or: The Misery of Mainstream Programming](https://hirrolot.github.io/posts/rust-is-hard-or-the-misery-of-mainstream-programming.html).  .

**State is hard: why SPAs will persist**  
https://nolanlawson.com/2022/05/29/state-is-hard-why-spas-will-persist/  
As tempting as it may be to pronounce one set of tools as dead and another as ascendant, it’s important to remain humble and remember that everyone is working under a different set of constraints, and we all have a different take on web development. For that reason, I’ve come around to the conclusion that SPAs are not going anywhere anytime soon, and will probably remain a compelling development paradigm for as long as the web is around. Some developers will choose one perspective, some will choose another, and the big, beautiful elephant will continue lumbering forward. Releated: [SPAs, Shared Element Transitions, and Re-Evaluating Technology](https://css-tricks.com/spas-shared-element-transitions-and-re-evaluating-technology/).

**携程机票前端Svelte生产实践**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/QWwb8PXtdJJUKyicHRmBkw  
整体来说，Svelte 继前端三大框架之后推陈出新，以一种新的思路实现了响应式。因其起步时间不算很长，国内使用程度仍然偏少，目前来说其生态还不够完备。但这不能掩盖其优势：足够“轻”。Svelte非常适合用来做活动页，因为活动页一般没有很复杂的交互，以渲染和事件绑定为主。正如文章最开始说的，一个简单的活动页却要用React那么重的框架多少有点委屈自己。所以对于一些营销团队，想在bundle size上有较大的突破的话，Svelte是绝对可以作为你的备选方案的。另外现在社区对于Svelte还有一个很好的用法是使用它去做Web Component，所以对于想实现跨框架组件复用的团队，用Svelte去做Web Component也是一个很好的选择。另附：[What's new in Svelte: June 2022](https://svelte.dev/blog/whats-new-in-svelte-june-2022)。

**抖音功耗优化实践**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/Sj3hSYpSoGIuNIUpu7ZQeg  
功耗优化是应用体验优化的一个重要课题，高功耗会引发用户的电量焦虑，也会导致糟糕的发热体验，从而降低了用户的使用意愿。而功耗又是涉及整机的长时间多场景的综合性复杂指标，影响因素很多。不论是功耗的量化拆解，还是异常问题的监控，以及主动的功耗优化对于开发人员来说都是很有挑战性的。本文结合抖音的功耗优化实践中产出了一些实验结论，优化思路，从功耗的基础知识，功耗组成，功耗分析，功耗优化等几个方面，对 Android 应用的功耗优化做一个总结沉淀。

**The ‘Form’ Element Created the Modern Web. Was It a Big Mistake?**  
https://www.wired.com/story/form-element-modern-web-mistake/  
A little HTML widget gave us all-powerful Amazon and Facebook. There's no closing Pandora's text box now.

**How we converted our Node.js library to Deno (using Deno)**  
https://www.edgedb.com/blog/how-we-converted-our-node-js-library-to-deno-using-deno  
At EdgeDB, we built and maintain a first-party client library for Node.js that’s available as the edgedb module on NPM. However, Deno uses a totally different set of practices to handle dependencies, namely direct URL imports from public package registries like deno.land/x. We set out to find a simple way to “Denoify” our codebase; that is, generate a Deno-compatible module from our existing Node.js implementation with minimal refactoring. This frees us from the complexity of maintaining and synchronizing two nearly identical codebases.

**You may not need a bundler for your NPM library**  
https://cmdcolin.github.io/posts/2022-05-27-youmaynotneedabundler  
I have seen a couple threads on twitter where people complain about the difficulty with publishing NPM libraries or ask what starter kit they should use (or, people recommended starter packs anyways)

**The Cicada Principle and Why It Matters to Web Designers (updated)**  
https://www.sitepoint.com/the-cicada-principle-and-why-it-matters-to-web-designers/  
Not long ago we looked at the process of making seamless tiles. As super-useful as seamless tiles are, it can be tough to get the balance just right. On one hand, you want to keep the image file dimensions as small as possible to take the best advantage of that tiling effect. However, when you notice a distinctive feature — for instance, a knot in some woodgrain — repeating at regular intervals, it really breaks the illusion of organic randomness. Maybe we borrow some ideas from those cicadas to make our tile feel less repetitive?

**Why science needs more research software engineers**

Ten years after their profession got its name, research software engineers seek to swell their ranks.

**Graph concepts and applications**  
https://engineering.grab.com/graph-concepts  
As the world becomes more interconnected and systems become more complex, it is more important to employ technologies that are built to take advantage of relationships and their dynamic properties. There is no doubt that graphs have sparked a lot of attention because they are seen as a means to get insights from related data. Graph theory-based approaches show the concepts underlying the behaviour of massively complex systems and networks.

**What Makes a Successful Delivery Lead on a Software Project Team?**

At Atomic Object, we have three core maker disciplines: software design, software development, and software delivery. In this article, I’d like to share more about the delivery discipline and the makers responsible for it: our Delivery Leads.

**The Open Future**  
https://engineering.atspotify.com/2022/05/the-open-future/  
What is the future of open source going to look like? At Spotify, we think it’s important to play an active role in helping to preserve what’s best about the community today while fostering the changes necessary for it to continue to succeed tomorrow. From increasing the impact of the projects we open source, to starting a fund for independent maintainers, to partnering with other companies to help ensure open source software is more secure for all of us, we’re investing in a more open future inside and outside of Spotify.

**我们与四位 App Store「独立开发者」，聊了聊他们的作品**  
http://www.geekpark.net/news/303164  
独立开发者，指的是不依赖外部资源来维持项目运营的开发者，仅用自己现有的资源，来保证自己的项目开发。虽然实际生活中，「独立开发者」往往也不是真的以单枪匹马形式出现，但独立开发者较小的团队规模，往往是决定能对自己的作品有更好的「质量控制」的关键：既不需要与各种甲方或营销需求打交道，因此能在较少干扰的同时，按照自己的理想来创作自己的 App。
