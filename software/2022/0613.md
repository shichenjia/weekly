**50 万行代码喂出来的一些编程经验**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/SMxcxWZt4atct0bUHPMO0g  
踏入职场后写代码已经有 14 个年头，保守估计应该垒了有 50 万行的代码。尤其最近 1 年多从 0 开始写起 Bytebase，日常也会 review 同事的代码。趁着端午也总结了一些经验，这些经验聚焦在写代码的具体细节上，在道，法，术，技中更多归之于技。首先声明这些技是用来帮助写出更可维护的代码，而不是更快地写出代码，Enjoy。

**为什么在关于“开发者生产力”的讨论中，却很少听到开发者的声音？**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/oDmSbtXV4-IN_GLmeVzlpg  
为什么我们在关于“开发者生产力”的讨论中却没有听到更多开发者的声音？大多数自诩为开发者生产力专家的人似乎对销售产品更感兴趣，而不是为开发者提供真正有效的指导。这种现象可能会导致我们沉浸在各种缩略术语、神奇的指标和方法论当中，却没能获得严谨的系统性思考。另附：[反思软件开发：人为因素（上）](https://ourai.ws/posts/human-factors-in-software-production-part-1/)。  

**Write HTML Right**  
http://lofi.limo/blog/write-html-right  
Even with a lot of help from a good text editor, writing HTML can be a drag. Nice documents end up as tag-swamps with little bits of content perched atop hills of tabs. Editing them becomes a test of patience and we get sick at the thought of having to look at our once-loved text. It doesn't have to be like this! There's a lightweight, easygoing way to write HTML that's been around since the beginning of the web.

**Kotlin 负责人：我们是如何一步步设计 Kotlin 的？**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/qAtg0rTwg1M9Yb-WF4AHlQ  
真正的编程语言是有生命的，是不断变化和发展的。与任何生产代码一样，它们的设计师的大部分时间都花在了缺陷修复和小改进上，而不是花在激进的新特性上。Kotlin 的独特之处在于：它多年来一直以用例和社区驱动的方式发展，早在 2016 年发布 1.0 稳定版本之前就开始了，即使是在 2011 年上市之前也有一段时间了。

**The collapse of complex software**  
https://nolanlawson.com/2022/06/09/the-collapse-of-complex-software/  
Ultimately, I think whether software follows the boom-and-bust model, or a more sustainable model, will depend on the economic pressures of the organization that is producing the software. A software company that values growth at all cost, like the Romans eagerly gobbling up more and more of Gaul, will likely fall into the “add-complexity-and-collapse” cycle. A software company with more modest aims, that has a stable customer base and doesn’t change much over time (does such a thing exist?) will be more like the humble tribe that follows the yearly migration of the antelope and focuses on sustainable, tried-and-true techniques. (Whether such companies will end up like the hapless Gauls, overrun by Caesar and his armies, is another question.)

Here, Stately founder David Khourshid makes the case for using event handlers and state machines to simplify handling effects in React apps rather than using useEffect which many developers struggle with and isn’t always well suited for the task anyway.

**The Future Of Frontend Build Tools**  
https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2022/06/future-frontend-build-tools/  
This article explores the concept of tooling for frontend development on the web. You will learn why we need frontend tooling, the various stages of evolution it has gone through, and the new developments that will shape the frontend build tools of the future. To follow along with this article, a general understanding of modern frontend development on the web is necessary.

**JavaScript Hydration Is a Workaround, Not a Solution**  
https://thenewstack.io/javascript-hydration-is-a-workaround-not-a-solution/  
In web development, Hydration is a technique to add interactivity to server-rendered HTML. It’s a technique in which client-side JavaScript converts a static HTML web page into a dynamic web page by attaching event handlers to the HTML elements. In this article, I’ll explain why I believe hydration is overhead. It’s not the solution; it’s a hack that consumes memory and slows down startup, especially on mobile. For the sake of this article, let’s define overhead as work that can be avoided and still leads to the same end result.

**When WebAssembly Replaces Docker**  
https://thenewstack.io/when-webassembly-replaces-docker/  
One of the more interesting discussions that attracted some attention during KubeCon + CloudNativeCon was how, due to its design, WebAssembly (also known as Wasm) can replace Docker in many circumstances. But as we’ll see below in this article, over-focusing on that aspect of WebAssembly is missing the point, since what is more important are the business uses that WebAssembly can support, as described below.

**Mobile-First CSS: Is It Time for a Rethink?**  
https://alistapart.com/article/mobile-first-css-is-it-time-for-a-rethink/  
The mobile-first design methodology is great—it focuses on what really matters to the user, it’s well-practiced, and it’s been a common design pattern for years. So developing your CSS mobile-first should also be great, too…right? 

**Mathematical Notation for JavaScript Developers Explained**  
https://runjs.app/blog/mathematical-notation-for-javascript-developers-explained  
Being able to understand and implement mathematics in JavaScript can be very useful. This is particularly true when working with highly visual and interactive applications, something JavaScript is well suited to. However, it can be hard to make sense of it all and how it translates to code without a background in mathematics. In this post, I'll explain some of the most common mathematical concepts and their symbols. I'll also provide examples so you can see how these concepts can be implemented in JavaScript. By the end of this post, you should have a better understanding of what those symbols mean and how you can translate them to code.

**Under the hood: Meta’s cloud gaming infrastructure**  
https://engineering.fb.com/2022/06/09/web/cloud-gaming-infrastructure/  
Enabling cloud gaming at Meta meant developing a new hardware and software infrastructure to address the challenges inherent in cloud gaming. Cloud-based games need low end-to-end latency to provide a fast and smooth gameplay experience where quality video and audio have to be streamed with as little jitter as possible. The infrastructure also needs to be capable of running multiple games on a single cloud gaming server to be economically efficient. And all this has to be secured against various cyberattacks while also remaining robust and efficient.

**Software process modeling with SPEM**  
https://modeling-languages.com/process-software-modeling-spem/  
The Software Process Engineering Metamodel Specification (SPEM) is an OMG’s standard used to describe software development processes or a family of related software development processes. The elements of SPEM can be categorized into method contents or processes. Method content are the roles defining development skills and responsibilities, tasks that those roles perform, and artifacts or work products that are the inputs and outputs of the tasks. The elements of a given method content are then assets to be combined and included into any process. A development process is a sequence of tasks performed by roles and makes explicit how work products are created and evolve over time.

**Announcing “Code” 2nd Edition**  
http://www.charlespetzold.com/blog/2022/06/Announcing-Code-2nd-Edition.html  
My intent in the 2nd edition is the same as the 1st edition: I start with very simple concepts but slowly build to a very deep understanding of the workings of digital computers. Through this steady progression up the hill of knowledge, I employ a minimum of metaphors, analogies, and silly illustrations, and instead use the language and symbols of the actual engineers who design and build computers.

**Plain text. With lines.**  
http://akkartik.name/lines.html  
I like plain text. I also like doodling while I write. Some things are just easier to explain with a picture. But if I need to draw a picture today, I need to stop writing plain text, pick an app, dismiss a couple of dialogs or tours of new features in front of my face, think about all the ways it's acting for its creators rather than for me, copy my text into it, draw my picture—and then I don't have plain text anymore. I end up with some bloated format that only one or two apps can open. Apps that may be well-behaved now, but tomorrow? Who knows?

“学我，不能全像我。化我者生，破我者进，似我者死。”这句话出自晚清著名画家吴昌硕之口，另外一位大画家齐白石也有类似的言论：“学我者生，似我者亡”。纵观中国互联网20余年历史，中小型企业多如牛毛，但世界级的明星企业却屈指可数，在人口红利消失殆尽、模式创新越来越难的情况下，不少企业深陷组织冗余陷阱，裁员风波此起彼伏。另附：
