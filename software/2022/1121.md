**Deno 1.28: Featuring 1.3 Million New Modules**  
https://deno.com/blog/v1.28  
Deno maintains that modern JavaScript should be built with ES Modules and web standard APIs. This release does not change that. Importing npm modules is done through URLs in a standard compliant fashion - we continue to move towards a browser-compatible future, where you're using web APIs such as fetch, Request, and Response. Now, Deno is taking npm a step forward by allowing you to access your favorite modules in a modern, secure programming environment. Releated: [Run npm and Deno anywhere](https://deno.com/blog/npm-and-deno-anywhere), [Build a More Secure Web using npm with Deno](https://deno.com/blog/a-more-secure-npm).  

**The Distributed Computing Manifesto**  
https://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2022/11/amazon-1998-distributed-computing-manifesto.html  
Today, I am publishing the Distributed Computing Manifesto, a canonical document from the early days of Amazon that transformed the architecture of Amazon’s ecommerce platform. It highlights the challenges we were facing at the end of the 20th century, and hints at where we were headed.

**Build the modular monolith first**  
https://www.fearofoblivion.com/build-a-modular-monolith-first  
Even talking about building a monolith today, is a bit taboo. It is all about microservices at the moment, and has been for a few years. But they aren’t a silver bullet…

**What’s so great about functional programming anyway**  
https://jrsinclair.com/articles/2022/whats-so-great-about-functional-programming-anyway/  
This is a sample chapter from my upcoming book: “A skeptic’s guide to functional programming with JavaScript.” Be sure to subscribe if you’d like to know when it’s available. It’s due for release soon. And there will be a discount for people who buy early.

**But, aren't you folks web2?**  
https://nadh.in/blog/web2-web3/  
There is great irony in the fact that a number of popular figures and organisations advocating most vocally for decentralisation, web3, and their crypto cousins have coincidentally amassed huge centralised fortunes from these schemes in a short span of time. Have we collectively become so blind so as to not see that, or is it the gold rush induced cognitive dissonance?

**The evolution of scalable CSS**  
https://frontendmastery.com/posts/the-evolution-of-scalable-css/  
A deep dive into the problems with scaling CSS on large projects. Understand the evolution of CSS best practices.

**43% Less Code With A Better Data Structure**  
https://profy.dev/article/react-junior-code-review-and-refactoring-1  
So here’s your opportunity to learn from these mistakes. On this page, you can find a code review and a step-by-step refactoring journey. By: using a better data structure, removing unnecessary state and a few other refactorings and cleanup. we increase the performance of the code, make it easier to read and maintain, and shorten the component from initially 177 to 102 lines (not that this is a good metric).

**The magical world of Particles with React Three Fiber and Shaders**  
https://blog.maximeheckel.com/posts/the-magical-world-of-particles-with-react-three-fiber-and-shaders/  
In this article, you will find all the tips and techniques I learned regarding particles, from creating simple particle systems with standard and buffer geometries to customizing how they look, controlling their movement with shaders, and techniques to scale the number of particles even further. You'll also get a deeper understanding of attributes, a key shader concept I overlooked in my previous blog post that is essential for these use cases.

**Single-page applications, multi-page applications, the history of Twitter tech, and a failed project**  
https://whitep4nth3r.com/blog/twitter-tech-history-spa/#and-the-cycle-continues  
Whilst deep in my research for the WTF project, I discovered some interesting historical information about Twitter tech and its development over time — and I’ve reached an interesting conclusion. Given that there’s a lot of talk about Twitter’s new ownership and where this might lead the platform right now, I thought it would be a good time to share my findings. But first, let’s take a look at what we mean by a SPA.

**Sapling: Source control that’s user-friendly and scalable**  
https://engineering.fb.com/2022/11/15/open-source/sapling-source-control-scalable/  
We’ve spent the past 10 years building Sapling, a scalable, user-friendly source control system, and today we’re open-sourcing the Sapling client. You can now try its various features using Sapling’s built-in Git support to clone any of your existing repositories. This is the first step in a longer process of making the entire Sapling system available to the world.

**No architecture is better than bad architecture**  
https://rogovoy.me/blog/no-architecture  
I guess the one-line summary is this: If you want to move fast, you have to put off building the architecture, and if some of your code is shit, at least let it be soft. As always, thanks for getting this far.

**Speeding software innovation with low-code/no-code tools**  
https://stackoverflow.blog/2022/11/15/speeding-software-innovation-with-low-code-no-code-tools/  
Low-code/no-code tools can help developers and non-developers alike.

**The Generative AI Revolution in Games**  
https://a16z.com/2022/11/17/the-generative-ai-revolution-in-games/  
There hasn’t been a technology this revolutionary for gaming since real-time 3D. Spend any time at all talking to game creators, and the sense of excitement and wonder is palpable. So where is this technology going? And how will it transform gaming? First, though, let’s review what is Generative AI?

**Ten Steps to “Code” — A Kind of Memoir**  
https://www.charlespetzold.com/blog/2022/11/Ten-Steps-to-Code.html  
The second edition of my book Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software was recently published, and I’ve already discussed the changes for the second edition. But sometimes people are curious about how books come to be written in the first place. Here is that story.

**Focus on high-leverage activities**  
https://addyosmani.com/blog/high-leverage-activites/  
"High Output Management" is a book by Andy Grove, former CEO of Intel, that helps people to understand how they can manage their teams more efficiently towards high-leverage tasks. I found this book relevant for software engineering organizations and thought I'd share some notes on it that may be relevant to others.

Albert Einstein’s ideas about space-time aren’t exactly intuitive, and they aren’t exactly Einstein’s, either.

**楼宇烈教授最新演讲：做中国人（完整实录）**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/Jwx_T92mDcseovMxA1kdvA  
为什么我说这个题目沉重呢？在座的可能会想：做中国人？我们生在中国，长在中国，生长在中国，为什么还提出“做中国人”这样一个题目来呢？我们近百年来，一直向西方学习，可以说学到了很多东西，也推动了我们国家多方面的文化发展；但是，我们有的人也丢失了中国心，有一点开始不像中国人。所以，我感觉这是一个非常大的问题、非常严重的问题。文化的自信、文化的主体精神，是一个民族、一个国家的显著标志，文化首先体现在我们的衣食住行里面。楼老师有一个讲书院和士子精神的视频也非常不错：[书院的启示](https://b23.tv/PHqPdaw)。
