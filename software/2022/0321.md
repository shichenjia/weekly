**Alert: peacenotwar module sabotages npm developers in the node-ipc package to protest the invasion of Ukraine**

On March 15, 2022, users of the popular Vue.js frontend JavaScript framework started experiencing what can only be described as a supply chain attack impacting the npm ecosystem. This was the result of the nested dependencies node-ipc and peacenotwar being sabotaged as an act of protest by the maintainer of the node-ipc package.

**Making WebViews work for the Web**  
https://www.w3.org/blog/2022/03/making-webviews-work-for-the-web/  
I live and breathe Web every day, and I am responsible for ensuring W3C technologies are positioned as well as possible for widespread adoption by developers. Yet I had not realized until a few months ago that the cumulative usage of WebViews – since that’s what I’m referring to here as a source of that usage – had become such a key mechanism to use content on the Web.

This is a story about a lot of things:  
- Fitting a Fortune 20 site in 20kB  
- Diving into site speed so deep we’ll see fangly fish  
- React thwarting my goal of serving users as they are  
- Burning out trying to do the right thing  
- And by the end, some code I dare you to try.

**Migrations Done Well: Typical Migration Approaches**  
https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/typical-migration-approaches/  
Migrations are one of the most overlooked topics in software engineering, especially at high-growth startups and companies. As a company’s operations grow, new systems and approaches are adopted to cope with extra load, more use cases, or more constraints. From time to time, engineers need to migrate over from an old system or approach, to a new one. And this is where things can get interesting, unexpected… and even ugly.

**向死而生：面向失败设计之道、术、技**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/a-RA9hP400qUjcdsXxjSbg  
不同年限的程序员差异到底在哪里？这个问题，我的理解是，除了架构设计能力、项目管理能力、技术规划能力、技术领导力之外，面向失败设计能力也是极其重要的一环。业务开发的新同学有时候可能会有迷之自信，觉得自己写的代码与老鸟们没有什么不同。实际上，编写正常流程的业务代码大家的差异不会太大，但是针对异常、边界、不确定性的处理才真正体现一个程序员的功力。老鸟们往往在长期的训练下已经形成多种肌肉记忆，遇到具体问题就会举一反三脑海里冒出诸多面向失败的设计点，从而写出高可用的业务代码。如何去学习面向失败设计的方法论，并慢慢形成自己独有的肌肉记忆，才是新手向老鸟蜕变的康庄大道。基于这样的考量，我写了这篇文章，对自己这些年来的一些经验和教训做了一些总结，希望能够抛砖引玉，让更多的老鸟们把自己的经验 share 出来，相互学习共同进步。

**Delightful React File/Directory Structure**  
https://www.joshwcomeau.com/react/file-structure/  
React is famously unopinionated when it comes to file/directory structure. How should you structure the files and directories in your applications? Well, there is no one “right” way, but I've tried lots of different approaches in the 7+ years I've been using React, and I've iterated my way to a solution I'm really happy with. In this blog post, I'll share the structure I use across all my current projects, including this blog and my custom course platform.

**Remix vs Next.js**  
https://bejamas.io/blog/remix-vs-nextjs/  
Remix, an edge-first, React-based full-stack framework created by the original team behind react-router, was recently open-sourced - and Next.js just got itself a strong new opponent. Honestly, that's never a bad thing!

The project shipped successfully, with no outages or major issues; error rates went down, and upload performance greatly improved. I

To start with a mental model, internationalisation lays the groundwork that enables localisation. This article will break both these terms down, and then take a look at the role that cultural norms play.

**What Is the Product-Market Fit (PMF) Item?**  
https://measuringu.com/product-market-fit-item/  
Despite their use in customer experience practice and some evidence the NPS is a reasonable proxy for future growth, neither the NPS nor the CES seems to be directly on point for assessing how well a product fits its market. In recent years, however, an item has been proposed to assess product-market fit (PMF). In this article, we describe this item and its use.

**3 Ways Marketing and Product Teams Can Improve Collaboration — And Drive Better Business Outcomes**  
https://www.reforge.com/blog/cross-departmental-collaboration-product-marketing  
Building and growing a business is a team sport that requires everyone to be on the same page. This is especially critical for product and marketing teams, who cannot move the business forward without each other. A product without customers is just a project. Customers without a meaningful product are just an unhappy audience. We’ve seen the evolution of this relationship over the past two few decades. It used to be that the product itself could be subpar so long as marketing could get it off the shelf. Then the pendulum swung: the product should be so good that it can sell itself without marketing.

顾维灏有一个小秘密。每天下班回家的路上，他会慢慢松开方向盘，把身下这台汽车全然交给辅助驾驶系统。代码在芯片里奔流，大块头的机器像水面上的浮叶，滑翔在北京的华灯夜色中。办公室离家9公里，不算远，但路况复杂，辅助驾驶系统不能完全应对。他需要在中途5次手动接管汽车。顾维灏的梦想很简单：用未来几年时间，把自己回家这段路的人工接管次数降到4次、3次、2次。。。想想，好像也没什么。但鲁迅说过：这世上本没有自动驾驶，接管的次数少了，也便成了自动驾驶。

春假时读了 Honeywell ex-CEO 高德威写的《长期主义》，书中他一直提及「同时追求两件互相矛盾的事」。我非常喜欢这个说法。他主要指：长期战略并不代表就要把短期业绩搞砸，短期业绩并不天然和长期业绩互斥。鱼与熊掌可以兼得，且必须如此。为未来布局，才可能赢；为现在努力，才可能活；现在活着却不考虑未来，未来可能活不好。

**健康从正心开始**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/cCZjiEXRXmnjxVG7f83iRw  
《大学》里面讲「正心诚意」，中医里面也讲「正气存内，邪不可干」。这个“正”很大意义上应该指的是心正。那么什么原因会导致心身失正呢？忿懥、恐惧、忧患、好乐等不良的情绪都会使身心偏离，不正便是邪。
