‚ÄúBlockchain protocols may be good for some things but they‚Äôre not good for Solid,‚Äù a web decentralization project led by Berners-Lee, he said. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre too slow too expensive and too public. Personal data stores have to be fast, cheap and private.‚Äù ‚ÄúIgnore the Web3 stuff, random Web3 that was built on blockchain,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not using that for Solid.‚Äù Releated: [Accelerating the energy transition with Web3 technologies](https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/11/02/1062403/accelerating-the-energy-transition-with-web3-technologies/), [Can Web3 beat public cloud?](https://blog.scottlogic.com/2022/10/31/can-web3-beat-the-cloud.html).

**Is Turbopack really 10x Faster than Vite?**  
https://github.com/yyx990803/vite-vs-next-turbo-hmr/discussions/8  
As the author of Vite, I am glad to see a well-funded company like Vercel making significant investments into improving frontend tooling. We may even leverage Turbopack in Vite in the future where applicable. I believe healthy competition in the OSS space eventually benefits all developers. However, I also believe that OSS competition should be based on open communication, fair comparisons, and mutual respect. It is disappointing and concerning to see aggressive marketing using cherry-picked, non-peer-reviewed, borderline-misleading numbers typically only found in commercial competition. As a company built on top of its OSS success, I believe Vercel can do better.

**Design Principles For The Web**  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8q03gUCB690  
Designing and developing on the web can feel like a never-ending crusade against the unknown. Design principles are one way of unifying your team to better fight this battle. But as well as the design principles specific to your product or service, there are core principles underpinning the very fabric of the World Wide Web itself. Together, we'll dive into applying these design principles to build websites that are resilient, performant, accessible, and beautiful.

**When clean code becomes harmful**  
http://blog.wolksoftware.com/when-clean-code-becomes-harmful  
Writing clean code is not what makes a developer a great developer. A great developer should:
- Be obsessed with delivering customer value.
- Have a good judgement for reaching compromises between code quality and customer value.
- Tries to write clean code but knows when to stop pursuing it.
- Knows that not all parts of a solution are equally critical and will only pursue clean code when is worth it. For example, interfaces are much more important than implementations. If you get interfaces right, replacing implementations over time should not be a problem.  
We should aim to write good enough software while remembering that developers don‚Äôt get to decide when software is good enough: Users do.

**A Love Letter to React**  
https://fly.io/blog/love-letter-react/  
My previous attempts at drive-by learning other reactive frameworks of the day were not so successful. Phoenix borrowed a lot from React when we first shipped LiveView in 2018, but only recently have we gone all-in with an HTML-aware component system in Phoenix 1.7. It's hard to imagine building applications any other way. What follows is a heartfelt homage to React's impact on the frontend and backend world, and how Phoenix landed where it did thanks to the revelations React brought almost ten years ago.

**What is a realm in JavaScript?**  
https://weizman.github.io/page-what-is-a-realm-in-js/  
The realms security field is far from being properly addressed, and I hope to gradually fix that starting by introducing the first open source realms security tool - Snow-JS ‚ùÑÔ∏è by LavaMoat üåã (stay tuned). But in order for any of this to make sense, we must first understand what realms are - and apparently that‚Äôs not an easy question to answer in a correct, yet informal and educational way.

**Is There Too Much CSS Now?**  
https://css-tricks.com/is-there-too-much-css-now/  
As front-end developers, we‚Äôve wished for a lot of things over the years ‚Äî ways to center things in CSS, encapsulate styles, set an element‚Äôs aspect ratio, get finer-grained control over our colors, select an element based on its children‚Äôs properties, manage layers of specificity, allow elements to respond to the width of their parents‚Ä¶ the list goes on and on. And now that we got all we wished for and more, some of us are asking ‚Äî do we now have too much CSS?

**5 Mistakes that Kill Collaboration Between Designers and Developers**  
https://www.uxpin.com/studio/blog/mistakes-that-kill-collaboration-between-designers-and-developers/  
We‚Äôve looked at how to make it easier for designers and developers to work together. But what roadblocks and workflows work against this collaboration? We‚Äôve researched common mistakes design teams and product managers make when working with software engineers and how they can collaborate better. Reducing friction and roadblocks creates a smoother product development process while increasing Design‚Äôs value.

**Embedded programming is like web development**  
https://the.scapegoat.dev/embedded-programming-is-like-web-development/  
I have learned a lot from working in both domains and have carried over not just ideas but actual code and tooling. Framing embedded development as low-level systems requiring advanced skills versus web development as a free-for-all, low-hanging fruit obscures how similar they are. Both are hard to get right, both benefit from a holistic systems approach, and actual code and tooling carry over surprisingly easily. I plan this to become a longer series that explores what I learned in my career in web and embedded, so stay tuned!

**Performance: Rust and its relationship with Node.js**

Hello everyone, and welcome to the Sprkl Expert Talk. This time, we‚Äôll discuss Rust and its relationship with Node.js regarding performance. In our expert talks, we host a prominent developer in each episode and explore topics that would bring value to the community. 

**The Real Problem with Go**  
https://vanitynotes.com/posts/20221101-the-real-problem-with-go  
Hint: It‚Äôs not error handling. Excuse the provocative title. I am actually a huge fan of the Go programming language. The real problem is human, and it‚Äôs about human processes. Critically, I do believe that the Go project is healthy enough that this can be solved.

**Reducing Instagram‚Äôs basic video compute time by 94 percent**  
https://engineering.fb.com/2022/11/04/video-engineering/instagram-video-processing-encoding-reduction/  
Instagram creates multiple encoded versions of uploaded videos, each with different characteristics. By repurposing one type of video encoding to help generate another type, we reduced the compute resources we spend on less-watched video encodings by 94 percent. With more resources available, we can produce more advanced encodings ‚Äî allowing more people to experience clearer video with smoother playback.

**Robots That Write Their Own Code**  
https://ai.googleblog.com/2022/11/robots-that-write-their-own-code.html  
Code as policies is a step towards robots that can modify their behaviors and expand their capabilities accordingly. This can be enabling, but the flexibility also raises potential risks since synthesized programs (unless manually checked per runtime) may result in unintended behaviors with physical hardware. We can mitigate these risks with built-in safety checks that bound the control primitives that the system can access, but more work is needed to ensure new combinations of known primitives are equally safe. We welcome broad discussion on how to minimize these risks while maximizing the potential positive impacts towards more general-purpose robots.

https://waxy.org/2022/11/invasive-diffusion-how-one-unwilling-illustrator-found-herself-turned-into-an-ai-model/  
The post sparked a debate in the comments about the ethics of fine-tuning an AI on the work of a specific living artist, even as new fine-tuned models are posted daily. The most-upvoted comment asked, ‚ÄúWhether it‚Äôs legal or not, how do you think this artist feels now that thousands of people can now copy her style of works almost exactly?‚Äù

**Meta Myths**  
https://stratechery.com/2022/meta-myths/  
Zuckerberg does, to be sure, deserve blame for this perception: he‚Äôs the one that renamed the company and committed to spending all of that money, and made clear that it was his vision that dictated that Meta‚Äôs efforts go towards expensive hardware like face-tracking, and the fact that he can‚Äôt be replaced has always been worth its own discount. This, though, feels like a rebrand that was too successful: Meta the metaverse company may be a speculative boondoggle, but that doesn‚Äôt change the fact that the old Facebook is still a massive business with far more of its indicators pointing up-and-to-the-right than its Myspace-analogizers want to admit.

**Cadence is everything: 10x engineering organizations for 10x engineers**  
https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2022/11/03/cadence-is-everything-10x-engineering-organizations-for-10x-engineers/  
Effective organizations are unnatural. The natural state of organizations is bureaucracy and turf wars, and once deprived of effective leadership they revert to their natural state with shocking speed. Similar to organizations in general, development organizations naturally tend toward inefficiency.
