**React I Love You, But You're Bringing Me Down**

Dear React.js, We've been together for almost 10 years. We've come a long way. But things are getting out of hand. We need to talk. It's embarrassing, I know. Nobody wants to have that conversation. So instead, I'll say it in songs. Releated: [React is bad because it's great](https://erock.prose.sh/react-is-bad-because-its-great).

**The Web is Good Now**  
https://2022.cascadiajs.com/speakers/chris-coyier  
There are quite a few things in the world of web design and development that have gotten… easy. It might be time to take a look at how you’re approaching some of the building blocks of your website because evolutions in browser technology and tooling have made many things easier and better. We’ll have a look at browser-level things like things as fundamental as layout, typography, and animation. Then also tooling level things like media handling, serverless concepts, and hosting.  

**26 Things from “101 Things I Learned in Architecture School”**  
https://daverupert.com/2022/09/26-things-from-101-things/  
Last year I read the book 101 Things I learned in Architecture School. It’s a good book. Good enough, I thought I’d share 26 Things I learned from “101 Things I Learned in Architecture School”. Meta. A lot of this will, of course, be applied to web design.

**How Airtable’s Quality Engineers use Airtable (to test Airtable)**  
https://blog.airtable.com/how-quality-engineers-use-airtable-to-test-airtable/  
The Quality Engineering group at Airtable aims to set a high bar for software testing at Airtable, and we frequently use Airtable to track the testing process.

**Remesh 介绍：用以开发大型复杂 Web App 的 DDD 框架**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/Xur4s28bmqGsxV7f4d2GZQ  
Remesh 是一个为开发大型复杂 Web App 服务的 DDD 框架。对 DDD 框架感到陌生的读者，可以暂且理解为状态管理框架（State-Management）。当然，Remesh 不止于此。我们将通过这篇文章，介绍 DDD 的起源和目标，介绍实现 DDD 的方式，推导出使用 DDD 框架的必然性和必要性，介绍 Remesh 的设计理念和使用等。

**Introducing Whisper**  
https://openai.com/blog/whisper/  
Whisper is an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system trained on 680,000 hours of multilingual and multitask supervised data collected from the web. We show that the use of such a large and diverse dataset leads to improved robustness to accents, background noise and technical language. Moreover, it enables transcription in multiple languages, as well as translation from those languages into English. We are open-sourcing models and inference code to serve as a foundation for building useful applications and for further research on robust speech processing.

**Rethinking Low-Code_No-Code and Open Source, Part 1 - NearForm**  
https://www.nearform.com/blog/rethinking-low-code-no-code-open-source-pt-1/  
We spoke with NearForm Field CTO, Paula Paul, about her experience unravelling and re-platforming low-code/no-code solutions that have constrained organizations, to get some insights into how leveraging open source can result in the same kind of rapid delivery but also save organizations from the headaches of re-platforming and modernization.

**How I’m a Productive Programmer With a Memory of a Fruit Fly**  
https://hynek.me/articles/productive-fruit-fly-programmer/  
I hope I have both piqued your interest in API documentation browsers and demystified the creation of your own documentation sets. My goal is to turbocharge programmers who – like me – are overwhelmed by all the packages they have to keep in mind while getting stuff done. My biggest hope, though, is that this article inspires someone to help me adding more formats to doc2dash, such that even more programmers get to enjoy the bliss of API documentation at their fingertips.

**Build your own Svelte**  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwvyKGw2CzU  
We will see how to create a framework like svelte, how to write a compiler, and we will go through "live coding" to actually write it out in less than 300 lines of code.

**Nightdrive**  
https://incoherency.co.uk/blog/stories/nightdrive.html  
I've made a JavaScript simulation of driving at night time on the motorway. It's hard to classify what it is. It's not a video, because it's generated dynamically. It's not a game, because you just watch. It's not a screensaver, because it's not the 90s. Maybe it's a "demo"?

**Why Rust is actually good for your car**  
https://medium.com/volvo-cars-engineering/why-volvo-thinks-you-should-have-rust-in-your-car-4320bd639e09  
This post is an interview made with one of our embedded Rust Pioneers, Julius Gustavsson who is a Technical Expert and System Architect at Volvo Cars Corporation.

**The Dead End**  
https://redmonk.com/sogrady/2022/09/23/dead-end/  
Open source was once the industry default, and developers and users alike benefitted immensely. Proprietary software took that all away in less than twenty years for more than twenty years, and it was only through an immense and unlikely set of events that proprietary software’s grip on the industry was rolled back.

**We hate Scrum and Agile…when it’s done wrong**  
https://stackoverflow.blog/2022/09/23/we-hate-scrum-and-agile-when-its-done-wrong-ep-488/  
When it's done wrong, it becomes punitive micromanagement. When it's done right, it empowers everyone to tackle the problems they handle best.

**Aging programmer**  
https://world.hey.com/jorge/aging-programmer-d448bdec  
Back in college, they told me that I would start my career writing code, but eventually, I would move to a position where I would ask others to code my designs. To celebrate that this turned out to be completely false, here are some assorted reflections as a 40-year-old programmer that looks back. Releated: [A Software Developer’s Most Important Skill?

**“If you don’t make it beautiful, it’s for sure doomed”: putting the Vault in GitHub’s Arctic Code Vault**  
https://github.blog/2022-09-20-if-you-dont-make-it-beautiful-its-for-sure-doomed-putting-the-vault-in-githubs-arctic-code-vault/  
GitHub this month installed a massive steel vault, etched with striking AI-generated art, deep within an Arctic mountain, finalizing its Arctic Code Vault. This vault contains the 188 reels of hardened archival film which will preserve the 02/02/2020 snapshot of every active public GitHub repository for 1,000 years. It also now includes a Tech Tree, a human-readable selection of works describing software, computers, and their foundational technologies, along with full-text copies of Wikipedia, Stack Overflow, and other data sources.

**Changing How You Decide Which Problems To Solve**  
https://www.svpg.com/changing-how-you-decide-which-problems-to-solve/  
This is the third of the three-article sequence diving into what is meant by meaningful transformation. So far we’ve talked about the need to change how you build, and the need to change how you solve problems.  But we haven’t talked about how you decide which problems are the most important to solve.

**The New Art of Making Books**  
https://thereader.mitpress.mit.edu/the-new-art-of-making-books-on-bookworks/  
In an advertisement for the space, he called them “non books, anti books, pseudo books, quasi books, concrete books, visual books, conceptual books, structural books, project books, statement books, instruction books,” a list suggestive of his vexed relationship with the marketplace. Ultimately, he would coin a new term to describe the kind of artists’ publications he championed: bookworks. In part, Carrión’s was a clarion call for authors to be more attuned to the book’s materiality and impact on meaning, but it was also a demand for a breakdown of the system that privileged writing as intellectual labor and denigrated the physical aspect of book production.

**我如何搭建自己的全链路知识系统**  
https://sspai.com/post/74992  
我是一名大二在读的本科生，经过大学一年的摸索，自认为对知识管理方面有一定的心得，想和各位分享一下。首先讲一下我的使用知识管理软件的理念：不盲目追求 all in one，专业的事要交给专业软件去做。好的软件应该有助于思维方式的培养，而不是束缚自己的思考。我将这个系统分为「输入-暂存-整理-输出」四部分，涵盖了知识的获取到内化的全流程，每个流程我基本都使用了不同的工具，思维导图如下。

**一个钉钉怎么面对「一千个哈姆雷特」**  
http://www.geekpark.net/news/308660  
一千个读者心中有一千个哈姆雷特，更何况是千行百业中的大客户，他们每一个需要钉钉帮助解决的问题都不尽相同。但钉钉只有一个，它怎么低成本、高效率地解决那一千个各式各样的需求？目前钉钉上百万人以上的企业组织超过已经超过 30 家，10 万人以上的企业组织已经超过 600 家。所以做大客户成功，钉钉有什么方法论？

**优越欲望：终其一生，我们都在为「优越感」而活**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/KDNBuer_wj7FUGzzgmEzZw  
人的很多行为，其背后的动机都来自优越感。可以说，我们每个人终其一生，都在为追求优越感而活。理解了优越感，你便理解了「人际关系」和「商业世界」的核心秘密。这是我今年对人性最大的感悟之一，分享给你。
