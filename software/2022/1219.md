**What I learned at GitLab that I don't want to forget**  
https://boleary.dev/what-i-learned-at-gitlab-that-i-dont-want-to-forget/
I hope that I can take even a small portion of that to my next adventure—but I wanted to be more specific to both myself and all of you about the things I think are most important to remember. It's hard to pick a "favorite" value or sub-value, so I've tried my best to summarize those life lessons that I've learned in three categories here:  
- Write down everything  
- Give and accept: ownership, agency, and responsibility  
- Be transparent with a low level of shame  

**Announcing SvelteKit 1.0**  
https://svelte.dev/blog/announcing-sveltekit-1.0  
SvelteKit is a framework for building web applications on top of Svelte, a UI component framework that developers love for its performance and ease of use. Releated: [Announcing SWR 2.0](https://swr.vercel.app/blog/swr-v2), [Htmx in a Nutshell](https://svelte.dev/blog/announcing-sveltekit-1.0).

**Avoiding web app duplication with React Native**  
https://blog.standardnotes.com/40921/no-react-native-is-not-the-future  
Standard Notes has seen its codebase evolve many times through the years. When we first launched in late 2016, we started with three codebases: our web app (which our Electron desktop app contained), a native Swift iOS app, and a native Kotlin Android app. This was immediately untenable. Coordinating bug fixes across three platforms was hard enough, but building new features? Out of the question. We had to call our app "simple" because we literally couldn't make it anything else.

**Correcting Overengineering**  
https://alexturek.com/2022-12-16-Correcting-Overengineering/  
Ultimately, overengineering isn’t about technical skills. It’s about hubris: believing that you can anticipate the distant future’s needs, better than somebody closer to the moment they need the thing. Less experienced engineers believe that in a positive sense; thinking that adding code now is cheaper than later. More experienced engineers learn that adding things to a system is cheap compared to maintaining and removing things.

框架界如今发生了不少你大概还不了解的、奇妙的事。如果你在想，“该死！真的需要又一个 JavaScript 框架吗？”那就错了，我不是来让你再去尝试另一个新框架的。我们为什么要为了不用某个东西而去用呢？我会在这篇文章中分享一些网页框架的神奇创新。我们值得更好的，不是吗？这些框架都默默无闻地存在了一段时间，目前都有很大进展，是时候关注它们了。如果你还不了解，那就太可惜了。

This is the 2nd article of my series of digging into the mind of a frontend developer. I will try to think aloud about how I should build an article layout by using CSS techniques like grid, flexbox, comparison functions, and more.

**Five Challenges to Building an Isomorphic JavaScript Library**  
https://doordash.engineering/2022/12/06/five-challenges-to-building-an-isomorphic-javascript-library/  
For context, Isomorphic JavaScript, also known as Universal JavaScript, is JavaScript code that can run in any environment — including Node.js or web browser. The alternative to Isomorphic JavaScript is creating separate, targeted libraries for each environment, for instance one for Node.js and one for the browser. Having a single library across environments offers straightforward benefits — if you can tackle the challenges involved in building one.

**Shipping Spotify’s Culture: 5 Plugins (and 4 Principles) for Supercharging Developer Experience at Scale**  
https://engineering.atspotify.com/2022/12/shipping-spotifys-culture-5-plugins-and-4-principles-for-supercharging-developer-experience-at-scale/  
ICYMI Spotify officially began selling enterprise software today: the Spotify Plugins for Backstage bundle subscription. Some of these commercial plugins began life as internal tools, built by Spotify developers, for Spotify developers. Other plugins in the bundle are brand new to the Backstage platform. But they all embody our ways of working — our secret sauce for improving developer experience at scale. And now that we’re sharing these plugins with the world, you don’t have to work at Spotify to see those principles in action. They’re right there in the plugins themselves, in how they work and how they were built.

**The GPT-3 Architecture, on a Napkin**  
https://dugas.ch/artificial_curiosity/GPT_architecture.html  
There are so many brilliant posts on GPT-3, demonstrating what it can do, pondering its consequences, vizualizing how it works. With all these out there, it still took a crawl through several papers and blogs before I was confident that I had grasped the architecture. So the goal for this page is humble, but simple: help others build an as detailed as possible understanding of the GPT-3 architecture. Releated:

**Self-Motivation: how to build a reward system for yourself**  
https://nesslabs.com/self-motivation  
Building a reward system is a powerful way to boost your productivity, reducing the need to rely on intrinsic motivation to complete the work you need (and want) to do. However, the rewards you choose must appeal to you, and for maximum impact, they need to be perfectly timed.

Y Combinator has funded well over 100 climate tech startups, and together they are worth over $10B. Many of the best ideas we’ve funded were ones that surprised us, so don’t feel like you need to work on one of these ideas in order to apply to the batch. That said, here are areas and ideas we find most interesting, and tarpit ideas you might consider avoiding.

能否理解和明白人生的无可奈何只能无可奈何，也是衡量一个人是否成熟标志。成熟的人会懂得，世界上的事并非是仅靠自己努力就能达成的。成熟的人知道，任何人都有力所不及的地方。一个人只能尽自己的力量朝成事的方向去努力，至于最后的结果，只能是“尽人事，听天命”。就人类而言，也是如此。

**睡个好觉可以预防新冠，其中有深刻的中医原理**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/-TSXYqwzXZl6BwQ9tWs7xQ  
疫情期间，好好养生培养正气，是最好的预防方式。什么是养生呢？简单来说，首先要治神，也就是要养精神，保持精神平和愉悦。第二点，就是健康作息，好好吃饭，好好睡觉。其中好好睡觉是至关重要的一个环节。熬夜的危害，我们整个社会是比较有共识的。很多人都知道熬夜危害大，但又不明白其中的原由。而中医对此有十分完备的理论解释，下面我们来谈谈这个话题。睡个好觉可以预防新冠，其中有深刻的中医原理。另附：[感染新冠的经历](https://coolshell.cn/articles/22341.html)、[后疫情时代，做自己心态的第一责任人](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/ASxnFKrC3YG1h65aS2rkiw)。

https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/YlK-0yYbZt4-MCfkXTs42Q  
如果说这一年最大的收获，便是在合伙人 @Light 的影响下，重新理解了「实事求是」：更加追求「真」，而非「美」，尤其是叙述意义上的「美」；可以客观地讨论「事实」，而不让自己情绪参与其中；以工程的视角来做事，而非像艺术家一样依赖灵感。
