https://www.yuque.com/tianzhou/bb/devops-tool-2022  
同时当下开源社区百花齐放，DevOps 团队在选择工具时也难免陷入眼花缭乱的选择障碍。本文尝试整理一套研发工具集，帮助 DevOps 团队搭建起一套最基本的研发工具体系。

**The new wave of React state management**  
https://frontendmastery.com/posts/the-new-wave-of-react-state-management/  
Understand the core problems state management libraries need to solve. And how the proliferation of modern libraries address them in new ways. Releated: [Simplify your full-stack applications with XState](https://blog.theodo.com/2022/07/simplify-your-applications-with-xstate/).  

**Why DRY is the most over-rated programming principle**  
https://gordonc.bearblog.dev/dry-most-over-rated-programming-principle/  https://gordonc.bearblog.dev/more-dry-talk-responding-to/  
DRY was the first programming principle I encountered and probably the only one I was aware of for the first year that I was a developer. It's also probably one of the simplest principles to understand. If you see two things in your code that are the same, maybe they should just be one thing. Hard to argue with that. But, I think that DRY is just like every other principle out there - it has its place, but it's best taken in moderation. And I think that, due to its ubiquity and simplicity, we tend to take DRY too far, far too often. So without further ado, let's dive into my three criticisms of DRY.

**How Stack Overflow is leveling up its unit testing game**  
https://stackoverflow.blog/2022/07/04/how-stack-overflow-is-leveling-up-its-unit-testing-game/  
We neglected unit tests for a long time because our code base made them difficult. But now we're putting in the work to change that. Releated: [How Platform Engineering Accelerates Software Delivery](https://www.nearform.com/blog/why-you-need-a-platform-engineering-team/).

**Decentralized Apps, the Metaverse, and the “Next Big Thing”**  
http://blog.archive.org/2022/07/05/decentralized-apps-the-metaverse-and-the-next-big-thing/  
In the fifth session of “Imagining a Better Online World: Exploring the Decentralized Web” – a joint series of events with Internet Archive, METRO Library Council, and Library Futures – “Decentralized Apps, the Metaverse, and the ‘Next Big Thing,’” Internet Archive Director of Partnerships Wendy Hanamura took a deep dive into the metaverse and NFTs through an exploration of virtual worlds with pioneering metaverse developer Jin.

**Why the HTML Outlining Algorithm was removed from the spec – the truth will shock you!**  
https://brucelawson.co.uk/2022/why-the-html-outlining-algorithm-was-removed-from-the-spec-the-truth-will-shock-you/  
So it’s good that this is removed from the WHATWG specification (now that the W3C specs are dead). I wish that you could use one generic heading everywhere, and its computed level were communicated to assistive technology. But browsers vendors ignored both Sir Uncle Timbo, and me (the temerity!) and never implemented it, so removing this from the spec will actually improve accessibility.

**Reimagining front-end web development with htmx and hyperscript**  
https://nomadiq.hashnode.dev/reimagining-front-end-web-development-with-htmx-and-hyperscript  
In recent years, a few mavericks and renegades have started to turn away from the world of JS frameworks and the inevitable bloated node_modules folders. But what if you want a smooth single-page app experience, rather than waiting for the whole page to render every time you click a button? Of course, nobody wants to write a load of boilerplate JS for every little interaction. This is where hypermedia in the form of htmx and hyperscript come in.

**BODY MARGIN 8PX**

The origin story for a style no one wants

**Holograms, light-leaks and how to build CSS-only shaders.**  
https://robbowen.digital/wrote-about/css-blend-mode-shaders/  
I've said it before, but it bears repeating: modern CSS is such an amazing tool to work with and I'm consistently impressed with the level of fidelity you can achieve. That said, It's time to address the potential elephant in the room. Depending on the device or browser you've used to read this article, your scroll performance might be on the floor and your fans may have kicked up a notch.

**Executing shell commands from Node.js**  
https://2ality.com/2022/07/nodejs-child-process.html  
In this blog post, we’ll explore how we can execute shell commands from Node.js, via module 'node:child_process'.

**Serverless Introspection Is Not Just For Machines**  
https://medium.com/lego-engineering/serverless-introspection-is-not-just-for-machines-5cc90dcd52ba  
There is a fundamental shift between thinking about UI layouts and interactions to the architectural and infrastructure based thinking that comes when working with Serverless.

**Guidelines for Quality Management of Research Artifacts in Model-Driven Engineering**  
https://modeling-languages.com/guidelines-for-quality-management-of-research-artifacts-in-model-driven-engineering/  
Artifact sharing is known to be helpful for researchers and practitioners to build upon existing knowledge, adopt novel contributions in practice, and increase the chances of papers receiving citations. In MDE research, there is an urge for artifact sharing and large open datasets and confidence measures about their quality, especially with the broader interest of the MDE community in AI-based techniques. This blog post briefs the finding of a MoDELS’21 paper that introduces a set of quality guidelines specifically tailored for MDE research artifacts.

**以太坊——Web3 的「黄埔军校」是怎么炼成的**  
http://www.geekpark.net/news/304894  
Web3 如风暴一般，迅猛地席卷全球科技互联网行业。以太坊是这场风暴的正中央，几年来，它掀起了 Web3 世界里一波又一波热潮——从 ICO，NFT，到 Defi、IDO 等概念。甚至就连 Web3 的概念，都是来自于以太坊的一名联合创始人。以太坊诞生的基石，是理想主义者 Vitalik（V 神）和一群理想主义者建立的对于去中心化的共识。但在社区壮大的过程中，有着太多非共识的部分难以调和，以太坊和 V 神每前进一小步，都伴随社区思想的分裂和团队成员的离开。

**飞书出品！如何举办一场别具特色的「线上虚拟发布会」？**  
https://www.uisdc.com/feishu-2022  
2022 年 5 月 25 日，「2022 春季飞书未来无限大会」如期举行。“Emoji 动效好可爱”、“发布会怎么能开得如此高级”、“年轻人喜欢飞书是有道理的”——这些来自用户的肯定让我们欢欣鼓舞。同时，我们也收到了一大波的提问：“直播间的效果是如何实现的”、“嘉宾是如何和场景互动的”、“PPT 的切换是如何控制的”等等。作为发布会的核心主创团队，本篇文章想仅就视效维度来跟大家聊一聊：如何诠释一场别具特色的「飞书线上虚拟发布会」。

**向前兼容：微软在多个领域后发先至的秘密**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/QOB2sYVWDMZVVopMGfzvOg  
想要占领一个市场，必须解决每一个进入障碍。如果忘记了 50% 的潜在市场障碍，那么你不可能得到超过 50%的市场份额，你将不会替代主导者，然后陷入鸡与蛋的问题。多数人其实并不愿意将精力花在导出与兼容上，而是希望能把潜在用户留在产品内。但成熟的战略方法不是强迫潜在用户接受，而是在你弱小的时候，通过兼容巨头的功能，消除迁移障碍。这样人们才会涌入，尝试你的业务。

**从马化腾到张一鸣: 缘起性空**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/DKApzPBILCDKTXagdABUwg  
马化腾用缘起性空的方式做产品，张一鸣用缘起性空的方式做企业，连接两个人的是张一鸣说过另一句话，“像做产品一样做企业”。相对于领导一家企业成功，通过打造一个机制然后由这个机制带动一家企业成功，后者可能更具挑战性。

**施一公：清华70%的高考状元都去哪了？**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/F3dhIYPSMvB-tfjXqdSkPA  
我受中国传统教育很深，作为一个敢担当的读书人，不仅应该风声雨声读书声，声声入耳，也需要家事国事天下事，事事关心。只可惜自己的时间精力实在太有限，总想找一些志同道合的朋友做点事情，总想有机会回家乡给父老乡亲做点什么。我挺惭愧的，其实我既没有照顾好我的母亲，也没有照顾好妻子和孩子。我们缺什么？我们缺这份对社会的责任感，我们缺这份回报父老乡亲的行动。在清华大学，我每次给生命科学学院的新生做入学教育的时候，我都告诉他们：千万不要忘了，你来到清华，你不止代表自己和个人，你也同时代表一个村，一个县，一个地区，一群人，一个民族。千万不要忘了，你肩上承担了这份责任。我真的希望，不管是我自己，我的学生，还是我的同道，我们每个人真的要承担一点社会责任，为那些不像我们一样幸运的人和乡亲们，尽一点义务。
