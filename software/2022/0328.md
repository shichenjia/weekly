**Remix: The Yang to React's Yin**  
https://kentcdodds.com/blog/remix-the-yang-to-react-s-yin  
React's tagline is: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. And it does a terrific job at that. React has never promised "network chasm management," but every web application needs it. With Remix managing that network chasm, we finally have a yang to React's yin. With a great rendering library and a super network chasm manager, you can build better, faster web applications with fewer bugs, simpler code, and more fun.

**是什么造成了中国软件产业的悲剧**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/O8klxfWDcGqG1E1TUjyjUg  
经历了这么多年的风风雨雨，作为中国软件的从业者，我常常在思考，为什么中国的软件产业还是很低端，并没有太多的优秀的软件问世，反而我们的邻国俄罗斯，最近这二十年完全无法和中国的经济发展相比较，但在软件行业里，前有大家基本上无法离开的 Nginx，后有现在已经大规模被使用中的 Clickhouse，这些都是有能力影响全世界的产品。中国的软件产业虽然也有长足的发展，但现实中，我们没有真正意义上的软件巨头型企业，大量基础软件被外国垄断，这究竟是为什么呢？另附：[反思软件开发：软件本身](https://ourai.ws/posts/rethink-software/)。

**Tao of Node - Design, Architecture & Best Practices**  
https://alexkondov.com/tao-of-node/  
To this day, it’s hard to find two Node applications that are structured similarly. In this post, I will summarize the set of principles that I’ve established about building Node applications. Take everything here as an opinion, not an absolute. There’s more than one way to build software.

**ModelRunner: an Open Source, No-Code, NLU and voice ready Data Platform**  
https://modeling-languages.com/modelrunner-open-source-no-code-nlu-voice-modeling-data-platform/  
ModelRunner is a complete data management platform which acts as a semantic layer above structured databases. It interprets information models which are basically a mix between ER models and UML diagrams in that they describe Entities and Attributes but also include a few extra artefacts like Applications, Packages, Actions etc and support all UML relationships (plus Back References) as well as formulas which can be expressed in object notation like Person.Name and can include functions like Sum(OrderLines.Amount).It also leverages workflow models where you can specify what happens when a data object is created or deleted or when a pre-requisite condition, expressed as a formula, becomes true.

**Fleek: A Web3 Developer Hub on IPFS**  
https://blog.ipfs.io/2022-04-24-fleek/  
Fleek is a development platform that allows developers to host dapps, websites, or other frontends and power their storage and data needs using Web3 protocols. It acts as an orchestrator of services such as IPFS, Filecoin, and ENS to provide an alternative to the traditional Web 2.0 hosting and storage infrastructure dominated by AWS, DNS, and others.

**What is the Web?**  
https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2022/what-is-the-web/  
I like Bohn’s working definition, however vague it might be in the details. “Be linkable and accessible to any client” is a provocative test for whether something is “of the web”.

**Hooks Considered Harmful**  
https://labs.factorialhr.com/posts/hooks-considered-harmful  
After several years of using them, I would love to share the dangers I encountered using hooks. I do not exaggerate when I claim that I find a dozen of hooks-related problems every single week while reviewing code. Most of those issues never manifest to the end-user, but incorrect code that is not a bug today will, eventually.

**一次关于架构的“嘴炮”**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/SJ6CNHo0CgiprbC1zQc9lg  
文章标题很随意，些微有一些骗点击的“贼意”；但内容却是充满了诚意，想必你已经感受到了。这是一次源于头条 Android 客户端软件架构问题的探讨，之所以冠上“嘴炮”之名，是因为它有一些务虚；同时又夹杂了一些方法论，不仅适用于客户端软件架构，也适用于其他工作场景，希望对大家有所帮助。为了拉满读者的带入感，且以“我们”为主语，来看架构的挑战、判断和打法。

**Application security: Cloudflare’s view**  
https://blog.cloudflare.com/application-security/  
The breadth and diversity of the sites we protect, and the billions of browsers and devices that interact with them, gives us unique insight into the ever-changing application security trends on the Internet. In this post, we share some of those insights we’ve gathered from the 32 million HTTP requests/second that pass through our network.

**Go: An Introduction To Generics**  
https://go.dev/blog/intro-generics  
Generics are a way of writing code that is independent of the specific types being used. Functions and types may now be written to use any of a set of types. Generics adds three new big things to the language:  
- Type parameters for function and types. 
- Defining interface types as sets of types, including types that don’t have methods. 
- Type inference, which permits omitting type arguments in many cases when calling a function.

**Adopting the practice of SRE**  
https://newrelic.com/blog/best-practices/adopting-sre-practices  
In this post, we’ll dive into what it takes to get into site reliability engineering, how to adopt it within your own organization, and some of the core principles and best practices you’ll need to keep in mind as you move forward in your SRE maturity journey.

**Authorization in a microservices world**  
https://www.alexanderlolis.com/authorization-in-a-microservices-world  
But how do you actually go from a simple flag to Role Based Access Control (RBAC) and then to Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC), especially in a microservices environment? In the following post I hope to help you get there.

**RPA vs Intelligent Automation: What is the Difference?**  
https://research.aimultiple.com/intelligent-automation-vs-rpa/  
As the adoption rates of automation technologies is increasing in the enterprise, different types of process automation technologies such as RPA, intelligent automation, cognitive automation, or hyperautomation in the market can cause confusion among business users or leaders. With this in mind, this article is intended as a guide for business leaders to understand the key differences between these tools in order to make sense of them.

**HTML and CSS in Emails: What Works in 2022?**  
https://designmodo.com/html-css-emails/  
Arguably, one of the most exciting aspects of web development in recent years has been a significantly more consistent level of support for new HTML, CSS, and ECMAScript (JavaScript) standards amongst web browsers. However, the same cannot be said for email clients despite the introduction of fresh features such as media queries, flex, rem units, and more. Let’s take a look at some of these features and how we can make them work for all email clients, in 2022.

**Auto-generated Summaries in Google Docs**  
https://ai.googleblog.com/  
We recently [announced](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/workspace/delivering-new-innovations-in-google-workspace-with-smart-canvas) that Google Docs now automatically generates suggestions to aid document writers in creating content summaries, when they are available. Today we describe how this was enabled using a machine learning (ML) model that comprehends document text and, when confident, generates a 1-2 sentence natural language description of the document content. 

**AI and nanotechnology are working together to solve real-world problems**  
https://stackoverflow.blog/2022/03/21/ai-and-nanotechnology-are-working-together-to-solve-real-world-problems/  
AI and nanotechnology are often seen as science fiction. But together they are finding real-world applications.

**Real Time Facial Animation for Avatars**  
https://blog.roblox.com/2022/03/real-time-facial-animation-avatars/  
In this post, we will describe a deep learning framework for regressing facial animation controls from video that both addresses these challenges and opens us up to a number of future opportunities. The framework described in this blog post was also presented as a talk at SIGGRAPH 2021.

**Introducing Swift Async Algorithms**  
https://www.swift.org/blog/swift-async-algorithms/  
As part of Swift’s move toward safe, simple, and performant asynchronous programming, we are pleased to introduce a new package of algorithms for AsyncSequence. It is called Swift Async Algorithms and it is available now on GitHub.

**Data50: The World’s Top Data Startups**  
https://future.a16z.com/data50/  
To help cut through the noise after a record-breaking 2021 in which data companies received tens of billions in venture capital investment — and an already strong 2022 — we’ve compiled the inaugural class of the Data50. These are the bellwether companies across the most exciting categories in data. In aggregate, these 50 companies are valued at more than $100B and have raised approximately $14.5B in total capital, with 20 having reached unicorn status by 2021. Without further ado, we’re excited to introduce the Data50 of 2022.

**企业家应有哲学修养，否则只能叫老板**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/zzYtFiAgYGrCf5FDmMyYpQ  
企业家同时也应该是社会贤达，否则只能叫老板。在中国社会历史上，农业社会中的社会贤达是乡绅，他们担当着社会责任的德行，他能够做其他人的榜样，是中国社会稳定的基本要素。而在今天这样的市场经济社会，工业乃至后工业时代，唯有企业家能扮演社会贤达的角色。但社会贤达不是一夜之间能够成为的，因为担当社会责任的能力与你拥有的资本能力并非成正比。社会贤达就像精神贵族，是几代人修养出来的。年青一代有为企业家应该充分意识到这一点，从现在开始学习修养起来，至少要在有限的社会生活范围里，做贤达人。
