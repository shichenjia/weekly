**Git’s database internals**  
https://github.blog/2022-09-02-gits-database-internals-v-scalability/  
This blog series will examine Git’s internals to help make your engineering system more efficient. Part I discusses how Git stores its data in packfiles using custom compression techniques.

**Why are you so busy?**  
https://tomlingham.com/articles/why-are-you-so-busy/  
You and your team should never be so busy that you can't do your job properly or that you begin to hate your work. Especially if you're a leader or a leader-of-leaders, then you should actually (yes you should, I'll die on this hill) have free time to think alone, and to talk and ideate organically with peers. Contrary to popular belief: back-to-back meetings isn't a badge of honour, it's a red flag.

**Be good-argument-driven, not data-driven**  
http://twitchard.github.io/posts/2022-08-26-metrics-schmetrics.html  
Data has its place. Metrics are a useful tool for making a certain class of persuasive arguments in certain domains. But they are only a tool for making good arguments. Data is not an end in itself. A weak argument founded on poorly-interpreted data is not better than a well-reasoned argument founded on observation and theory. Stop going all googly-eyed (tee hee) at statistics. Metrics are tempting. They promise easy answers. Resist! Be skeptical! Have no tolerance for poor arguments made with data. Keep intrinsic motivation alive.

**Announcing Flutter 3.3 at Flutter Vikings**

https://medium.com/flutter/wonderous-explore-the-world-with-flutter-f43cce052e1  
Today we’re announcing Flutter 3.3. This release is focused on refinements and performance improvements that reinforce the features shipped in Flutter 3. It expands support for the evolving Material 3 specification with several new components and a number of bug fixes, and it includes new features aimed at tablet and desktop developers including Scribble handwriting support on iPad, selectable text grouping, and trackpad support. This release also includes Dart 2.18, which introduces FFI support for libraries and code written in Swift or Objective-C. Apps that are built against this release will experience improved performance across desktop, web, and mobile, so we encourage you to run flutter upgrade to get the latest on all your developer workstations!

**Why React Contexts Are Great and Why We Didn’t Use Them**  
https://spin.atomicobject.com/2022/08/24/react-contexts/  
We found React Contexts enabled easy data sharing. However, this tool requires discipline to effectively control what is on the context and what can edit it. Did my team miss an opportunity by not making use of React contexts? Were the issues we bumped into a problem of our understanding or problems inherent in the tool? Let me know in the comments, and always experiment to find the right patterns for each project.

**CSS Classes considered harmful**  
https://www.keithcirkel.co.uk/css-classes-considered-harmful/  
There are many great ways we express states and parameters of a component without having to shoehorn them into an archaic system like the class attribute. We have mechanisms today to replace it, we just need to unleash ourselves from our own shackles. Upcoming standards will allow us to express ideas in powerful new ways.

**Building an aircraft radar system in JavaScript**  
https://charliegerard.dev/blog/aircraft-radar-system-rtl-sdr-web-usb/  
A few years ago, I came across this awesome talk by Thomas Watson in which he talks about how he built AirplaneJS, a web app that picks up ADS-B radio signals from airplanes and plots them in real time on a map in the browser. I had no idea this was possible in JavaScript so I started looking into it. I played around with the project and started wondering if there was a way I could push it a little bit further.

**[译]JavaScript框架大战已结束，赢家只有一个**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/vMA3x-a-663sN9Yqa3qBHQ  
框架之战是 JavaScript 社区中的热门话题，也是业界众多圣战之一。一开始，jQuery 崭露头角，接下来 AngularJS 初露锋芒，再到现代框架混战，战争一直很激烈。然而现在框架之战已经结束，是谁赢得了最终的胜利，它又是凭什么取胜，且看本文分解。

**从转系生到终身教授：十二年图形学物理模拟的自我回顾**  
https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/560415998  
最近评上tenure，有人来祝贺：”Now you can freely decline review requests!”。我想了想，似乎对心态上的改变确实如此而已。又想到也许可以写个什么纪念一下。那这19岁到31岁，有什么拿来回味的没有？好像有很多，但不整理一下的话，又不知从何说起。那还是直接写一点吧。从物理本科，到CS PhD，CS教职，又在数学tenure，这看似曲折的十二年竟是在做同样的研究，一年都没有浪费。一路走来，有很多东西值得缅怀和总结，也许能帮助思考未来。顺便把这一路干过的牛逼的事，和遇到过的牛逼的人都写下来，看着应该很舒爽。

**北大数学天才柳智宇下山还俗，主动要求降薪至 2 万，不买房买车，也不准备生孩子，如何理解他的人生选择？**  
https://www.zhihu.com/question/551205351/answer/2656718052  
这个十二年前在出家后震惊全国的数学天才，终于回归熙攘的人世间了。据九派新闻报道，现在，他在中关村的一家心理咨询公司担任事业部部长，带领小团队开发心理学课程。公司承诺给3万月薪，但他主动要求降至2万，觉得应该把钱留给「更需要的人」。

**BASIC UX Framework – Definition, Benefits, and Application**  
https://www.uxpin.com/studio/blog/basic-ux-framework/  
BASIC UX is an acronym describing five essential user experience design principles for building “usable products.” It’s unclear who developed the framework, but it surfaced around 2016.

**Why your website should be under 14kB in size**  
https://endtimes.dev/why-your-website-should-be-under-14kb-in-size/  
What is surprising is that a 14kB page can load much faster than a 15kB page — maybe 612ms faster — while the difference between a 15kB and a 16kB page is trivial. This is because of the TCP slow start algorithm. This article will cover what that is, how it works, and why you should care. But first we'll quickly go over some of the basics.

**Software Mimicry**  
https://www.hillelwayne.com/post/software-mimicry/  
Mimicry is when software X reimplements at a higher level a core feature of software Y. The produced facsimile has some, but not all, of the same properties, enough to “look like” it’s the same thing but missing many of the nuances. This exists in every kind of software. One language can mimic another, a library can mimic a language, a database engine can mimic a product, etc.

**SQL will never die**  
https://blog.sqlizer.io/posts/sql-will-never-die/  
Entitled “The Rise of SQL”, it’s a fascinating glimpse into how a query language invented in the 1970s is more relevant today than ever, and it’s the “second progamming language” every developer should know.

**Devops: An Idea so Good, No One Admits They Don’t Do It**  
https://wagslane.dev/posts/no-one-does-devops/  
The ideas behind the DevOps movements undeniably changed the software development world for the better - but by now, the term “DevOps” has lost all meaning. Sometimes an idea is so good, that you can’t argue with it. I’m not saying that the original idea behind “DevOps” was perfect - I’ve written about some of the specific issues I’ve seen. That said, I think there is enough data and research behind the core ideas by now that there are very few companies willing to admit they don’t “do DevOps”. They’re afraid they’ll look like they’re behind the times. Releated: [Why - and how - DevOps roles are changing](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2022/08/31/the-changing-roles-in-devsecops/).

**The Scoop: Netflix’s historic introduction of levels for software engineers**  
https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/netflix-levels/  
Netflix introducing levels marks the end of the longest policy of “one level” for everyone. I’m impressed the company was able to scale to close to 2,000 software engineers with one, single level, and no internal levels, for so long. While it’s not uncommon for companies to operate with a single level up to around 100 software engineers, Netflix was able to run this setup successfully for far longer.

**Don’t think to write, write to think**  
https://herbertlui.net/dont-think-to-write-write-to-think/  
Writing is the planning process and the final product: You don’t design a final piece of writing the same way you might design a computer on paper. No writing emerges complete; everything has a starting point, and it’s usually a really crummy first draft. (It might also appear as an interview, a note, etc.)

**The sum of all knowledge**  
https://christianheilmann.com/2022/08/29/the-sum-of-all-knowledge/  
Last week my mother died. After we put her urn into the ground next to my father’s we went back to their flat to talk about next steps and dividing up their belongings amongst us three children. One thing I immediately called dibs on were my father’s two books.

https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/N1jnLNY-9jDLoAz_sxX7kA  
如果世界上果真有张三这个人，他真的拒绝了大哥做黑产的邀请，接下来，他的命运会如何呢？他会不会继续精进技术，甚至有机会加入某家公司，成为技术团队的一员，去做反诈呢？而回头看，蚂蚁这群技术超群的老师傅，是否也在某一时刻曾面对过诱惑，只是遵从了内心的良善，才用十年的时间细细铸就了一尊门神？我猜，在佛眼中，众生终究平等，技术并无善无恶，正邪也非泾渭。真正使人不同的，无非是渺小的你我在每个十字路口做出的庄重抉择。

**有生活才能做好产品吧**

别的产品不好说。至少很难想象小红书这样的产品，是由一些每天哭丧着脸忧愁明天的汇报怎么交代、在会议室里天天拍桌子瞪眼、除了工作没有任何个人志趣的人做出来的。最后摘录这么一句话吧，是看到他们活动的一张照片里的：去和真实世界链接，去投入生活，去交几个朋友，去治愈自己，去拥抱不确定性。另附：[快手: 人到中年，转身决战](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/n6Cs7pH0569nRqzWEFU8zA)、[就算雷军，也要“认命”](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/t7621n4GZmJzNrUjzRBsJg)、[做产品，别做产品经理](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/PMK1P4OQicMhTjTJQBxWXQ)。
