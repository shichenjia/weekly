**In defense of simple architectures**  
https://danluu.com/simple-architectures/  
Wave is a $1.7B company with 70 engineers1 whose product is a CRUD app that adds and subtracts numbers. In keeping with this, our architecture is a standard CRUD app architecture, a Python monolith on top of Postgres. Starting with a simple architecture and solving problems in simple ways where possible has allowed us to scale to this size while engineers mostly focus on work that delivers value to users. Stackoverflow scaled up a monolith to good effect (2013 architecture / 2016 architecture), eventually getting acquired for $1.8B.

**这群程序员为何坚持30年“免费”写代码？**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/NUh9Irom16fPVedjoybS4w  
近年来，中国开发者已经成为全球开源体系中的重要力量。公开信息统计显示，中国的代码在全球开源社区的比重已占40%左右，目前全球6000多万开发者中，至少有2000多万来自中国。但我们也好奇，相比国外，中国的开源历史也只有短短三十年时间，这三十年，到底是哪些人在默默推动开源环境的变化？而从“一无所有”到“繁花似锦”，中国又是如何逐渐走出自己技术自主的道路的？本期显微故事找到了那些在中国开源进程中默默贡献的程序员们，希望从他们身上，看到中国开源的跌宕三十年。

**Functions, Objects and the Principles I Follow**  
https://alexkondov.com/functions-objects-and-the-principles-i-follow/  
Resources on structure and design are usually implemented in context so you need imagination and creativity to turn them into more generic rules. Each time I find myself navigating an implementation without known patterns to help me, I rely on some fundamental programming principles. In chess, if you follow the basic ideas you will naturally end up in good positions. The same is true in software. Like chess players put their knights out before the bishops, here are the software development principles that I follow.

**Integrating Content Management Systems in model-driven processes**  
https://modeling-languages.com/content-management-system-modeling-generation/  
We know very well how to model databases as input/output artefacts in a model-driven development process. We know how to extract their schema, query their data or, conversely, generate the SQL code that will create them. We even know how to do this for NoSQL databases. But nowadays, many companies do NOT acces their data via a database but through a Content-Management System (CMS). In this post, we show how to integrate CMS as input data source in a modeling project.

**Tweaking In The Browser**  
https://ishadeed.com/article/tweaking-in-the-browser/  
When we have an already implemented design in the browser, then it’s so much easier to tweak it, and eventually, we might “design” something different from what we started with. I like the term “tweaking” better for that context. The question is, what do we need to be able to design in the browser? And what we can do in the browsers with the current developer tools?

**Airtable: What is a database? Everything you need to know.**  
https://blog.airtable.com/what-is-a-database/  
A database is a collection of data that is organized so the information within can be easily accessed later. Your data will be more accurate, reliable, and easy to use if you have a database. Releated: [What is scripting?](https://blog.airtable.com/what-is-scripting/).

**Decentralization for Web3 Builders: Principles, Models, How**  
https://future.a16z.com/web3-decentralization-models-framework-principles-how-to/  
The promise of decentralization has been heavily discussed and debated, from why it matters to the bigger question of who will control the software that powers the internet. These questions are critical, because as we have seen, when control is held in the hands of a very few, encroachments on personal freedom, choice, and privacy are inherent. “Don’t be evil” is very different than “can’t be evil” when a CEO decides one course or another.

**Migrating from Apollo Server v2 to v3 — Part 2: Server Upgrade**  
https://medium.com/lego-engineering/migrating-from-apollo-server-v2-to-v3-part-2-server-upgrade-e9a9b7cafad5  
In the last section, I wrote about how we upgraded our tooling in preparation for our full Apollo Server 3 upgrade. In the final article on this topic, I’ll talk about the steps we took to mitigate and resolve all the breaking changes in v3, as well as how we upgraded the live server in place.

**How Kafka Connect helps move data seamlessly**  
https://engineering.grab.com/kafka-connect  
Grab’s real-time data platform team a.k.a. Coban has written about Plumbing at scale, Optimally scaling Kakfa consumer applications, and Exposing Kafka via VPCE. In this article, we will cover the importance of being able to easily move data in and out of Kafka in a low-code way and how we achieved this with Kafka Connect.

**Comparing Go vs. C in embedded applications**  
https://stackoverflow.blog/2022/04/04/comparing-go-vs-c-in-embedded-applications/  
Impossibly tight deadlines, unrealistic schedules, and constant pressure to develop and release applications on time, while at the same time achieving excellent quality. Sound familiar?

**Becoming a Full-Time Creator as a Software Engineer: Controversial Advice**  
https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/how-to-become-a-full-time-creator/  
With remote work becoming more common in tech, I get more and more messages from people asking the same: how can they do what I do? Despite being considered a successful creator, I don’t think that “creator” is a real thing - at least not a category anyone can or should aim for. This post collects my thoughts on how to become a full-time creator. Or, as I prefer to think of it, run a one-person, bootstrapped, profitable startup.

**The business of design**  
https://medium.com/dropbox-design/the-business-of-design-359499a64c57  
Core design principles are undervalued and overlooked in most of today’s business operating practices. Complementing design principles with business operational practices will bring more empathy, connection, innovation, and financial returns to any team or company.

**阿里巴巴的十三载计算力大突围**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/1I86gXdgNSAKUve9CVvc4A  
“分布式计算系统”，在今天有了更朗朗上口的名字——云计算。而王坚带领的这群人，就是如今的阿里云众将。历史的转捩点前，王坚壮怀激烈，为起航的阿里云计算镌刻一行使命：为了无法计算的价值。可叹彼时，空有凌云之志，周身尚无爪牙。粗略来说，“无法计算的价值”要想实现，起码包含两个步骤：“造云”和“上云”。

**What are you doing, WordPress.com?**

https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30894980  
https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30896807  
I recently wrote that I’ve stuck with WordPress.com for so long, for all its purported limitations, because its features fully suffice the committed blogger whose content is textual for the most part and because the company behind WordPress.com is running a good business, with the right ideals. (To the uninitiated, here’s an explanation of the differences between WordPress.com and WordPress.org.) But in the last two or three days, WordPress.com has jolted both these beliefs with a surprisingly wide-ranging rejig of its paid plans.

**The Next Google**  
https://dkb.io/post/the-next-google  
DuckDuckGo and Bing are not true alternatives – they’re just worse versions of Google. The next Google can’t just be an input box that spits out links. We need new thinking to create something much better than what came before. In the last few years, different groups of people came to the same conclusion, and started working on the next generation of search engines. For this new generation, privacy is necessary, and invasive ads are not an option. But that’s where the commonalities end. Beyond that, they’ve all taken the idea of a search engine in very different directions.

笔者之前做了2年半的BI产品建设，基于自己的工作经验，来跟大家聊聊：如何从0-1搭建产品的完整路径。整个内容从产品规划、产品设计和整合资源三个模块来讲。产品规划，是要让我们做一个定位正确的产品；产品设计，讲究的是一个正确的过程；而整合资源呢，则是要有合适的人和正确的文化。

**一院士给博士生的一封信：每天工作12小时，这仅是一个下限！**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/M0VQ8Ep35K5lXrRkOPIbGw  
有人说是没有时间，我看是不愿投入时间。对博士生而言，每天工作12小时是正常的，少于这个时间就不正常了；每周工作六天半以上是正常的，少于六天半就不正常了。我这里是基于美国PhD四年学制所得到的概念。在我们目前三年学制还要强制性学半年英语的情况下，上述时间的投入充其量也只是一个下限。
