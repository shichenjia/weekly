**Chrome, 10 years later**  
https://neugierig.org/software/blog/2022/12/chrome.html  
It's been around 10 years since I worked on Chrome. Here are some stories that have surely been embellished by my own memory over that decade of distance. Treat them all as only maybe 60% true. I figured I could at least write them down before I totally forget them.

**First Principles Thinking for Software Engineers**  
https://addyosmani.com/blog/first-principles-thinking-software-engineers/  
First principles thinking can be helpful for solving complex problems because it allows you to break down a problem into its core elements and then systematically build up a solution from there. This can be a more effective approach than trying to solve a problem using preconceived notions or by making assumptions about the problem based on your past experiences.

**A debugging manifesto**  
https://jvns.ca/blog/2022/12/08/a-debugging-manifesto/  
Hello! I’ve been working on a zine about debugging for the last 6 months with my friend Marie, and one of the problems we ran into was figuring out how to explain the right attitude to take when debugging. We ended up writing a short debugging manifesto to start the zine with, and I’m pretty happy with how it came out. Here it is as an image, and as text (with some extra explanations). Releated: [Tips for analyzing logs](https://jvns.ca/blog/2022/12/07/tips-for-analyzing-logs/).

**Vite 4.0 is out!**  
https://vitejs.dev/blog/announcing-vite4.html  
Today, the Vite team with the help of our ecosystem partners, is happy to announce the release of Vite 4, powered during build time by Rollup 3. We've worked with the ecosystem to ensure a smooth upgrade path for this new major. Vite is now using Rollup 3, which allowed us to simplify Vite's internal asset handling and has many improvements. 

**We're breaking up with JavaScript frontends**

https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33934580  
Unpoly enables fast and flexible frontends for server-rendered HTML views. It has no dependencies and plays nice with existing code. Releated: ['Stop Writing Fake React Code'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-lumOeD2fk).

**Can AI Write Authentic Poetry?**  
https://thereader.mitpress.mit.edu/can-ai-write-authentic-poetry/  
Cognitive psychologist and poet Keith Holyoak explores whether artificial intelligence could ever achieve poetic authenticity. Releated:

**Is Prisma better than your 'traditional' ORM?**  
https://practica.dev/blog/is-prisma-better-than-your-traditional-orm/  
Surely use Prisma under these scenarios - If your data needs are rather simple; when time-to-market concern takes precedence over the data processing accuracy; when the DB is relatively small; if you're a mobile/frontend developer who is doing her first steps in the backend world; when there is a need for business-class support; AND when Prisma's long term business continuity risk is a non-issue for you

**You might not need a CRDT**  
https://driftingin.space/posts/you-might-not-need-a-crdt  
In this post, I’ll first give some high-level context on CRDTs, and then talk about why we often find other approaches used in practice.

**AWS re:Invent 2022 - Keynote with Dr. Werner Vogels**  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfvL_423a-I  
Dr. Werner Vogels, Amazon.com VP and CTO, talks about the benefits of building asynchronous, loosely coupled systems and how event-driven architecture enables global scale. He then explains how the cloud is enabling customers to build more immersive experiences using 3D and how simulation is empowering customers to experiment and innovate in new ways. 

**A Look Back at 2022 for Go Gamedev with Ebitengine™**  
https://ebitengine.org/en/blog/2022.html  
It's been 9 years since I started to develop Ebitengine. This article is a retrospective of Ebitengine in 2022.

**Personalization Pyramid: A Framework for Designing with User Data**  
https://alistapart.com/article/personalization-pyramid/  
After completing dozens of personalization projects over the past few years, we gave ourselves a goal: could you create a holistic personalization framework specifically for UX practitioners? The Personalization Pyramid is a designer-centric model for standing up human-centered personalization programs, spanning data, segmentation, content delivery, and overall goals. By using this approach, you will be able to understand the core components of a contemporary, UX-driven personalization program (or at the very least know enough to get started). 

**What Do Libraries Have To Do With Building a Better Internet?**  
http://blog.archive.org/2022/12/09/what-do-libraries-have-to-do-with-building-a-better-internet/  
When thinking about how to build a better internet—one that is focused on the public interest and promoting meaningful participation for everyone—libraries are key players. And to fulfill that role, libraries need to have policies that allow them to thrive online. Releated: [Internet Archive Scholar](https://scholar.archive.org/).  

**EBPF 介绍**  
https://coolshell.cn/articles/22320.html  
很早前就想写一篇关于eBPF的文章，但是迟迟没有动手，这两天有点时间，所以就来写一篇，这文章主要还是简单的介绍eBPF 是用来干什么的，并通过几个示例来介绍是怎么玩的，这个技术非常非常之强，Linux 操作系统的观测性实在是太强大了，并在 BCC 加持下变得一览无余。这个技术不是一般的运维人员或是系统管理员可以驾驭的，这个还是要有底层系统知识并有一定开发能力的技术人员才能驾驭的了的。

**How to make time for learning in tech**  
https://stackoverflow.blog/2022/12/08/how-to-make-time-for-learning-in-tech/  
Everybody wants to learn more. But then sprints happen and you don't make time for it.

**A year of new avenues**  
https://www.robinsloan.com/lab/new-avenues/  
In this newsletter, I want mainly to offer an exhortation. Then, because I can’t help myself, I’ll comment on an item of current interest. I’ll conclude with a technical question, because I know the right nerds are reading. This message was emailed to lab newsletter subscribers. The assumed audience is subscribers who feel invested in the future of the internet who also have the capacity, and/or curiosity, to tinker on new projects. (Here’s more about assumed audiences.) Here’s my exhortation: Let 2023 be a year of experimentation and invention! Let it come from the edges, the margins, the provinces, the marshes!

做事，得了解动机之德。什么动机，自己知。下学而上达，善人往上，最后与天地合其德。中国人管中国事，必要用中国方法。中国管好了，世界就有望，将来中国是一条猛龙。得往“公”的路子走，则愈走愈合民心。历史上各朝代，最后都因为私心加重、德能日低，而覆亡了。智日弱、德日衰，愈无能的愈把持。学科技到西方，但政术必得是中国。另附：[《论语》在今天的意义](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1g4411G7VK/)、[假如你正与病毒斗争，假如你感到孤独苦闷](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/77nbL_szc_t66pCjreEQ9A)、[成为自己](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/qjvks8jEZRvb_MvyzgIVyQ)。
