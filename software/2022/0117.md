**深入浅出 tnpm rapid 模式 - 如何比 pnpm 快 10 秒**  
https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/455809528  
作为一名老前端，不得不感慨，前端变得越来越复杂，依赖安装的速度很慢很慢。前几天我们也在 蚂蚁 SEE Conf 2022 发表了主题演讲：《一种秒级安装 npm 的方式》。本文从另一个角度来阐述下关于前端依赖安装提速 整个优化工作的背景、思考、结果以及未来。黑魔法和黑科技的区别在于：前者用"又不是不能用"的脏活来实现目的，后者用跨领域的知识来实现降维打击。这是我们坚持在知乎做了 5 年的 Node.js 科普的第 100 篇文章，如果对你有帮助，请点赞。

**不优雅的 React Hooks**  
https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/455317250  
时至 2021 年年底，React Hooks 已在 React 生态中大放异彩，席卷了几乎所有的 React 应用。而其又与 Function Component 以及 Fiber 架构几近天作之合，在当下，我们好像毫无拒绝它的道理。诚然，Hooks 解决了 React Mixins 这个老大难的问题，但从它各种奇怪的使用体验上来说，我认为现阶段的 Hooks 并不是一个好的抽象。红脸太常见，也来唱个黑脸，本文将站在一个「挑刺儿」的视角，聊聊我眼中的 React Hooks ~

**Software Is Automating Design. What Does That Mean For Designers?**  
https://future.a16z.com/automated-design-apps-design-systems/  
We’ve reached a tipping point: As more and more traditional design tasks become automated, the role of the designer must shift. Beyond adding a slew of new software fluencies to their resumes, the coming era will require that designers take on new, expanded roles – ones that go well beyond what we’ve traditionally filed under the umbrella of design.

**JavaScript dev deliberately screws up own popular npm packages to make a point of some sort**

Faker.js and colors.js sabotaged by maker. Two popular open-source packages were recently sabotaged with mischievous commits, creating confusion among those using the software and exacerbating concerns about the fragility of the open-source software supply chain.

**How we ship GitHub Mobile every week**  
https://christianheilmann.com/2022/01/11/offline-no-dice/  
Since we’re a small team, repeating this release process every week would mean less time spent writing code or building new features. In order to focus on product development, we use a number of tools to automate the release process. In this post, I’ll share how we automate the build release process by using the iOS pipeline as an example.

**5 Front-End Development Trends for 2022**  
https://www.browserlondon.com/blog/2022/01/10/5-front-end-development-trends-for-2022/  
I’ve approached the creation of this list of front-end development trends with a little trepidation – most change is incremental, and the observations here are all patterns that are already happening and will likely still ring true in 2023. You could take a look at our 2021 front-end predictions, and they would still be completely valid. Nevertheless, here are some thoughts on five front-end development trends coming our way in 2022.

**Publishing and consuming ECMAScript modules via packages – the big picture**  
https://2ality.com/2022/01/esm-specifiers.html  
The ecosystem around delivering ECMAScript modules via packages is slowly maturing. This blog post explains how the various pieces fit together:  
- Packages – JavaScript’s units for software distribution  
- The three kinds of ECMAScript module specifiers  
- Providing and using packages via module specifiers in Node.js, Deno and web browsers

**A Unified Theory of Web Performance**  
https://calendar.perfplanet.com/2021/  
In a recent Perf Planet Advent Calendar post, Tanner Hodges asked for what many folks who work in this space would like for the holidays: a unified theory of web performance. I propose four key ingredients:  
- Definition: What is “performance” beyond page speed? What, in particular, is “web performance”?  
- Purpose: What is the purpose of web performance as a discipline? What are its goals?  
- Principles: What are this discipline’s guiding principles?  
- Practice: What does it look like to practice web performance? How do we do it?  

**The Optional Chaining Operator, “Modern” Browsers, and My Mom**

Reminds me of this line, which I love, from the W3C’s design principles: The internet is for end users: any change made to the web platform has the potential to affect vast numbers of people, and may have a profound impact on any person’s life.

**Could Rust be the Future of JavaScript Infrastructure?**  
https://thenewstack.io/the-case-for-rust-as-the-future-of-javascript-infrastructure/  
Rust is now replacing parts of the JavaScript web ecosystem like minification (Terser), transpilation (Babel), formatting (Prettier), bundling (webpack), linting (ESLint) and more. Let’s take a deep dive into why this trend is gaining popularity and wider adoption. Releated: [2021 年 Rust 生态版图调研报告](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/458046979).  
 
**Rethinking errors, warnings, and lints**  
http://neugierig.org/software/blog/2022/01/rethinking-errors.html  
Programming language ecosystems often involve tools that process code and produce errors or warnings, such as compilers and linters. Different programmers have widely different opinions on how to treat these systems. This culminates in disagreements around questions like: Should I treat all warnings as errors? Why is X an error and not a warning? Can I ignore lint warnings? In this post I aim to give you a framework for how to reason about these systematically, with lessons learned from my recent years of work on programming language tooling for thousands of engineers at Google.

作为一个产品经理，我们最离不开的一个词，就是“需求”。能传达我们对需求的理解与定义的工具就是产品需求文档。而产品需求文档也是贯穿于整个产品设计研发过程中的一个关键指导纲领。在工作期间，我撰写了不少需求文档，同时在理解需求、表述需求、实现需求的过程中不断磨练自己的产品思维。因而撰写此篇文章，尝试通过具体经验反思总结，形成系统化、可实践复用的关于产品需求文档撰写的方法论。希望这篇文章能帮助同样是产品新人的同学们学会用产品思维撰写需求文档，并运用到其他的策划工作中。本文将围绕是什么、为什么、怎么写产品需求文档以及用产品思维讲述如何写好需求文档，让需求文档助力产品落地上线。
