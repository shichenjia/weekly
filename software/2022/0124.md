**Becoming a Better Writer in Tech**  
https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/becoming-a-better-writer-in-tech/  
Writing is an increasingly important skill for engineering leaders. Indeed, poor writing can hamper career progression, above a certain level. Tactics for more clear, more frequent and more confident.

**Open source creates value, but how do you measure it?**  
https://github.blog/2022-01-20-open-source-creates-value-but-how-do-you-measure-it/  
Open source software has transformed our lives. Using someone else’s running code allows developers to focus efforts on unsolved problems without reinventing the wheel—accelerating innovation at scale. To developers, this is obvious. But too often, it is not as clear to policymakers. This matters, because while governments often provide public goods, digital infrastructure can be overlooked. And it’s not just missed opportunities to do more: policies may inadvertently endanger open source collaboration. One of our primary goals on the GitHub Policy Team is to help policymakers understand the value of open. Releated:

**The Truth About Starting With Microservices**  
https://arnoldgalovics.com/truth-about-microservices/  
Starting a greenfield project with microservices is easy. The promises are wonderful but often they are far from reality. This time I’ll share my experience on the truth about microservices when starting a project from scratch. This is the second article in this topic. You can read the previous one here: [Don’t start with microservices – monoliths are your friend](https://arnoldgalovics.com/microservices-in-production/).  

**前端领域的 “干净架构”**  
https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/458410158  
大家好，我是 ConardLi，前端有架构吗？这可能是很多人心里的疑惑，因为在实际业务开发里我们很少为前端去设计标准规范的代码架构，可能更多的去关注的是工程化、目录层级、以及业务代码的实现。今天我们来看一种前端架构的模式，原作者称它为“干净架构（Clean Architecture）”，文章很长，讲的也很详细，我花了很长时间去读完了它，看完很有收获，翻译给大家，文中也融入了很多我自己的思考，推荐大家看完。

**区块链、元宇宙、Web3、数字货币，泡沫之下的时代大幕正在缓缓升起**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/HpHSvQKRlKE42XXrLTl9_g  
我也算是一个区块链从业者，除了自己本质工作和区块链紧密相关外平时也会接触到一些“币圈”的消息，是革命还是泡沫？我确实有自己的一些思考，这些思考也渐渐明晰。希望本文可以让那些对区块链不是很了解的朋友对区块链有一个初步的认识，也希望可以让对区块链相关已经熟悉的朋友可以看到一个有趣有意思的思考角度。今天就从我的角度畅聊一下，和大家交流交流。本文将会从四个点阐述我的观点：  
- 比特币等虚拟货币是不是泡沫？有没有价值？  
- 区块链构建下的 Web3 里的理想主义。  
- 数字人民币背后的货币战争，国家之间的对抗可能比我们想象得更剧烈。  
- 我们能否生活在元宇宙中？时代浪潮下的个人抉择。

**TypeScript Features to Avoid**  
https://www.executeprogram.com/blog/typescript-features-to-avoid  
This post lists four TypeScript features that we recommend you avoid. Depending on your circumstances, there may be good reasons to use them, but we think that avoiding them is a good default. TypeScript is a complex language that has evolved significantly over time. Early in its development, the team added features that were incompatible with JavaScript. Recent development is more conservative, maintaining stricter compatibility with JavaScript features.

**NoJS - Creating a calculator with only pure HTML and CSS. No Javascript!**  
https://blog.scottlogic.com/2022/01/20/noJS-making-a-calculator-in-pure-css-html.html  
Recently, I have been expanding my CSS knowledge and couldn’t think of a more practical way of using what I learned than to make something that any reasonable person would probably involve JavaScript for. I have created this pixel art app and this calculator. Here is how I made the calculator.

**Plan for tradeoffs: You can’t optimize all software quality attributes**  
https://stackoverflow.blog/2022/01/17/plan-for-tradeoffs-you-cant-optimize-all-software-quality-attributes/  
An essential part of requirements analysis is understanding which quality characteristics are the most important so that designers can address them appropriately.

**Roblox Return to Service 10/28-10/31 2021**  
https://blog.roblox.com/2022/01/roblox-return-to-service-10-28-10-31-2021/  
We’re sharing these technical details to give our community an understanding of the root cause of the problem, how we addressed it, and what we are doing to prevent similar issues from happening in the future. We would like to reiterate there was no user data loss or access by unauthorized parties of any information during the incident. Roblox Engineering and technical staff from HashiCorp combined efforts to return Roblox to service. We want to acknowledge the HashiCorp team, who brought on board incredible resources and worked with us tirelessly until the issues were resolved.

**Improving Web Vulnerability Management through Automation**  
https://eng.lyft.com/improving-web-vulnerability-management-through-automation-2631570d8415  
Vulnerability management is important, but can be incredibly time consuming. We have to scan our systems and then fix the vulnerabilities that we’ve discovered. In a large software engineering organization this becomes more challenging — service owners are responsible for fixing vulnerabilities in their systems along with all their other work, and security has to track this work, nudge engineers to actually fix things, and report to CISO/compliance/etc. Fortunately much of this work lends itself to automation, letting security engineers focus on understanding and fixing vulnerabilities! In this post we’ll focus specifically on web vulnerabilities, and some of the fun automation challenges this process poses.

**Stop paying tech debts, start maintaining code**  
https://blog.testdouble.com/posts/2022-01-20-stop-paying-debts-start-maintaining-code/  
To that end, I want to accomplish a few things in this article. I want to provide a frame shift on tech debt. I use frame shift as a way to say stop using the term Tech Debt! I also want to break down some meaningful, practical, day-to-day ways to discuss and practice software maintenance.

**Event-driven architecture and reactive programming**  
https://retool.com/blog/event-driven-architecture-and-reactive-programming/  
This article will look at the terminology of event-driven architecture and reactive programming, and the problems they are trying to solve. In the next article in this two-part series, we will provide a real-life example architecture, putting the concepts into practice. 

**Patterns of Legacy Displacement**  
https://martinfowler.com/articles/patterns-legacy-displacement/  
Effective modernization of legacy software systems. When faced with the need to replace existing software systems, organizations often fall into a cycle of half-completed technology replacements. Our experiences have taught us a series of patterns that allow us to break this cycle, relying on: a deliberate recognition of the desired outcomes of displacing the legacy software, breaking this displacement in parts, incrementally delivering these parts, and changing the culture of the organization to recognize that change is the unvarying reality.

**企业最重要的产品是什么**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/x76QiHtLa_Jx_Ao4SMKe-w  
万般结果，皆归结于系统。系统接纳偶然，但不依赖偶然。人和人、企业和企业之间的巨大鸿沟，不是来源于天赋和努力，而是来源于是否理解系统并且依赖系统。每家企业都有两种产品，一个是面向客户的产品，另一个就是组织本身。这两个产品，都可以用系统驱动的方式去构建、运营和迭代升级。而面向客户的产品，本质上是组织的产物。所以，卓越企业都是使用架构组织的方式实现业务的长期目标。
