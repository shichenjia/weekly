**RenderingNG deep-dive: BlinkNG**  
https://developer.chrome.com/en/blog/blinkng/  
Blink began life as a fork of WebKit, which is itself a fork of KHTML, which dates to 1998. It contains some of the oldest (and most critical) code in Chromium, and by 2014 it was definitely showing its age. In that year, we embarked on a set of ambitious projects under the banner of what we're calling BlinkNG, with the goal of addressing long-standing deficiencies in the organization and structure of the Blink code. This article will explore BlinkNG and its constituent projects: why we did them, what they accomplished, the guiding principles that shaped their design, and the opportunities for future improvements they afford.

**The absurd complexity of server-side rendering**  
https://gist.github.com/Widdershin/98fd4f0e416e8eb2906d11fd1da62984  
I don't think that SSR apps are fundamentally a bad idea. That said, the way we're going about it right now is terrifyingly complex and error-prone. If you're considering using one of these frameworks, I would recommend you carefully consider if the complexity is worth it, especially for less-experienced members of your team. For those who do pursue SSR, I advise you to work towards better static analysis to help manage these problems. Rust has built a career by explicitly recognising that lifetimes exist and that we need better tools to work with them. A similar opportunity exists here for SSR apps.

**语雀文档编辑器将开源：始于但不止于Markdown**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/0WPwPhcvBlwOmPB9Z7zwGQ  
阎王透露团队计划将语雀文档编辑器的代码开源，期望在社区的开放合作模式下，让语雀编辑器变得更好更强。写作对于每一个开发者来说都是非常好的习惯，能够帮助我们实现终身学习的目标，而一款好用的文档工具能够帮助我们将所学所想建立成知识库，并受益终生。另附：[开源，真有源头活水来吗？](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/oku6uCvrb_YFkUIVhQm7l)。

**用了十年，你真的看懂朋友圈了吗？**  
http://www.geekpark.net/news/301104  
十年过去，朋友圈本身确实「没怎么变」。今天发布一条朋友圈，或者刷朋友圈的体验，和十年前没有什么本质的区别。从更新频率也能看出变化很小——过去十年，微信日志中关于朋友圈的更新只有 15 条，最近一次停留在 2018 年。但是十年里，朋友圈也「改变」了很多。十年前，我们关心一个人的近况，是打电话嘘寒问暖，而今天不少人的第一选择，是翻一下他/她的朋友圈；十年前，我们表达对一个公共议题的关注，是拉上几个好友青梅煮酒，而今天则是转发一条朋友圈；甚至最近，一个 HR 朋友聊天时和我说，现在了解候选人的性格，加一下微信翻翻他的朋友圈，已经成为 HR 的「基操」…… 今天是朋友圈十岁的生日，值得聊一聊朋友圈的「变与不变」，以及这些细节背后微信团队可能是怎么想的。

https://microservices.io//post/microservices/2022/04/23/ten-years-of-microservices.html  
This week is the 10th anniversary of my first talk about the microservice architecture. In April 2012, I was in Kiev, Ukraine (see note below) as part of the Cloud Foundry Open Tour 2012 (Kiev, Moscow and London). At the Kiev event, I gave a new presentation Decomposing applications for deployability and scalability.

**Addressing the last mile problem with MySQL high availability**  
https://engineering.linkedin.com/blog/2022/addressing-the-last-mile-problem-with-mysql-high-availability  
MySQL is the first database choice for applications at LinkedIn that require a relational database store. Managing a large number of databases involves handling numerous complexities; the MySQL SRE team at LinkedIn is responsible for maintaining 99.99% uptime for the service provided to our internal customers. Over the years, we have made many changes to the way we operate our databases to bring down the Mean Time to Recover (MTTR).

**How Retool upgraded our 4 TB main application PostgreSQL database**  
https://retool.com/blog/how-we-upgraded-postgresql-database/  
Retool’s cloud-hosted product is backed by a single beefy 4 TB Postgres database running in Microsoft’s Azure cloud. Last fall, we migrated this database from Postgres version 9.6 to version 13 with minimal downtime. How did we do it? To be frank, it wasn’t a completely straight path from point A to point B. In this post, we’ll tell the story and share tips to help you with a similar upgrade.

**Introducing arun.is 2.0**  
https://www.arun.is/blog/arun-is-2-0/  
Today, I’m announcing the most significant set of improvements to this website since I started it in 2016. I hope this redesign can serve me for another five years or more. If I succeed, I can incrementally add to the system without going to the drawing board again. I still have a long list of potential improvements like search, performance gains, interactive components, etc. They’ll provide plenty of fodder for future weekends of hacking.

**Should I Open Source my Company?**  
https://supabase.com/blog/2022/03/25/should-i-open-source-my-company  
Supabase has been open source from day one. This is one of the best decisions we've made. It didn't feel like a difficult decision at the time, since kiwicopple and I are long time users and advocates of great open projects like PostgreSQL, Python, Bitcoin, React, [... insert long list]. Open-sourcing Supabase ended up surprising us in many ways. Many people imagine that maintaining your business in public might be burdensome - but the opposite is true. There are many unexpected upsides that have made building Supabase - the product and the company - easier.

Hello 下一个程序员 a.k.a. 新的上帝！摆在你面前的是一份诱惑：100 小时后，代码能让你成为一个新世界的主宰。很多时候，世界不是你想要的样子。你的生活里，有多少无解的难题；你的工作掌控你，而不是你获得满足感的工具。如果你愿意从现在开始尝试编程，你的条件总不会比盲人更差；如果你在犹豫起步是不是已经比 10 岁的神童晚太多，至少 81 岁还和你相距甚远。
