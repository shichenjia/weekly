**Computational notebooks research at CHI 2022**  
https://austinhenley.com/blog/notebooksatchi2022.html  
Last week I attended the ACM CHI 2022 conference in New Orleans, the premier research conference in human-computer interaction. My goal was to attend as many presentations about data science and human-AI collaboration as possible. Below are my notes about a handful of the presentations on computational notebooks, including my summary and links to the presentation video, short preview video, and paper for each.

**Language packs: Meta’s mobile localization solution**  
https://engineering.fb.com/2022/05/09/android/language-packs/  
Language packs enable us to provide a high-quality user experience that’s localized for people around the world. With this infrastructure, engineers have the ability to create and deliver gendered translations in a simple and intuitive way. This infrastructure has already been adopted by Facebook and Workplace, and we are exploring integrating it into our other Meta apps. With language packs, we have reduced the IPA size of Facebook for iOS by 16.6 MB, which helps it stay fast and responsive for the people who use it.

**MVC frameworks aren't dinosaurs but sharks**  
https://www.david-dahan.com/blog/10-reasons-mvc-frameworks-arent-dinosaurs-but-sharks  
I think there is a serious shark in web sea: the monolithic MVC framework. Rails (Ruby), Django (Python), Laravel (PHP) and many others. They've been here for a long time, and even they're kind of boring, they still do the job very well. Of course, they're not the right solution for every use case. Like any piece of tech, there are always trade-offs to consider. But I'd like to explain, in an opinionated way, why I think this piece of tech should not be discarded so easily just because of its age. If you acknowledge with many of the points bellow, odds are an MVC framework could be the right tool for your project, even in 2022. Releated: [Bud - The Fullstack Go Framework for Prolific Web Developers](https://github.com/livebud/bud), [Why We Depend on Rails for Many Projects](https://www.simplethread.com/why-we-depend-on-rails-for-many-projects/).

**Building a Musical Instrument with the Web Audio API**  
https://www.taniarascia.com/musical-instrument-web-audio-api/  
I hope you liked my write-up for the Keyboard Accordion app! Of course, the full code is available on GitHub. There are a few little bugs here and there, such as if you use keyboard shortcuts while also pressing other keys, it will get stuck on a note forever. I'm sure if you try to find more bugs you'll be able to.

**Divs are bad!**  
https://www.matuzo.at/blog/2022/divs-are-bad/  
The issue with divs is not the quantity, although a large DOM can affect performance negatively, and an unnecessarily large document is harder to read and debug. The real problem is the placement. If you put a div in the wrong place, it can have serious negative side effects.

**How To Use Google CrUX To Analyze And Compare The Performance Of JS Frameworks**  
https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2022/05/google-crux-analysis-comparison-performance-javascript-frameworks/  
Google collects performance information from millions of opted-in Chrome browsers around the world and uses this information as a performance ranking factor for its search engine. But it also makes this information freely available so that anyone can use it to check the real-world performance of individual websites. Even more significantly, it’s possible to segment this data according to the technologies used in the websites. In this article, Dan Shappir leverages this information to analyze and compare the performance of leading JavaScript frameworks. Along the way, he uncovers unexpected behaviors and solves a web performance mystery.

**Present and Future of the Microservice Architecture**  
https://www.infoq.com/presentations/present-future-microservices-architecture/  
The panelists reflect on various microservices topics. Releated: [Wave: a Case Study for Low Architectural Complexity](https://www.infoq.com/news/2022/05/wave-low-architecture-complexity/).

**I'm All-In on Server-Side SQLite**  
https://fly.io/blog/all-in-on-sqlite-litestream/  
I'm Ben Johnson. I wrote BoltDB, an embedded database that is the backend for systems like etcd. Now I work at Fly.io, on Litestream. Litestream is an open-source project that makes SQLite tenable for full-stack applications through the power of ✨replication✨. If you can set up a SQLite database, you can get Litestream working in less than 10 minutes.

**A Generalist Agent**  
https://www.deepmind.com/publications/a-generalist-agent  
Inspired by progress in large-scale language modelling, we apply a similar approach towards building a single generalist agent beyond the realm of text outputs. The agent, which we refer to as Gato, works as a multi-modal, multi-task, multi-embodiment generalist policy. The same network with the same weights can play Atari, caption images, chat, stack blocks with a real robot arm and much more, deciding based on its context whether to output text, joint torques, button presses, or other tokens. In this report we describe the model and the data, and document the current capabilities of Gato.

**Goodbye Facebook. Hello Decentralized Social Media?**  
http://blog.archive.org/2022/05/13/goodbye-facebook-hello-decentralized-social-media/  
The pending sale of Twitter to Elon Musk has generated a buzz about the future of social media and just who should control our data. Wendy Hanamura, director of partnerships at the Internet Archive, moderated an online discussion April 28 “Goodbye Facebook, Hello Decentralized Social Media?” about the opportunities and dangers ahead. The webinar is part of a series of six workshops, “Imagining a Better Online World: Exploring the Decentralized Web.” 

**The Other Kind of Staff Software Engineer**  
https://earthly.dev/blog/line-staff/  
Let’s talk about a career in tech, but not the usual boring stuff about salary or how to pass the interview process at the place with the most oversized comp packages. Instead, let’s talk about how your relationship to how the company accomplishes its goals influences what your job is like and what skills and strengths you’ll develop there.

**Focus on Impact, Respect and Hospitality: Product culture at Lyft**  
https://eng.lyft.com/focus-on-impact-respect-and-hospitality-product-culture-at-lyft-6a6259782fed  
The TL;DR of Lyft’s PM culture is: Focus on impact above everything else. Take care of each other and create an inclusive environment. Go above and beyond to serve our users with high quality products and hospitality that they can rely on.

**The Making of A New Kind of Science**  
https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2022/05/the-making-of-a-new-kind-of-science/  
https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/  
I Think I Should Write a Quick Book… In the end it’s about five and a half pounds of paper, 1280 pages, 973 illustrations and 583,313 words. And its creation took more than a decade of my life. Almost every day of my thirties, and a little beyond, I tenaciously worked on it. Figuring out more and more science. Developing new kinds of computational diagrams. Crafting an exposition that I wrote and rewrote to make as clear as possible. And painstakingly laying out page after page of what on May 14, 2002, would be published as A New Kind of Science.

**The origins of product design**  
https://prototypr.io/post/the-origins-of-product-design/  
If you had asked me last year when industrial design first began, I would’ve said approximately the Stone Age. If something can be made well, then something can be made better, and we know that rudimentary stone tools evolved over time to improve their functions, ergonomics, convenience, and durability. For what it’s worth, I still stand by this assertion. But it wasn’t until I read the book The Evolution of Useful Things by Henry Petrosky earlier this year that I learned of one very specific catalyst for the modern industrial design we know: Raymond Loewy.
