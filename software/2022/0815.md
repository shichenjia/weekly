**语雀的源起、定位与世界观**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/xd7uAsivYE1PJRfKKfeTBw  
本期播客我们关注的产品是语雀，邀请到的嘉宾是语雀的总负责人玉伯和产品负责人镜同。语雀是蚂蚁集团旗下一款想做下一代文档和知识库的产品，我跟语雀的两位话事人聊了语雀的发展来由、产品定位和世界观。重点放在了语雀跟内外部关系的八卦和拷问上了。要知道，语雀面临这个外部的关系可不止是跟文档类、协同类产品竞争的问题，还包括在阿里生态这个体系内跟钉钉是什么样的关系，明明现在集团对钉钉的投入更大，语雀还是一个技术中台发起而非业务团队发起的项目，为什么语雀没被钉钉收编。以及语雀跟蚂蚁集团和支付宝的关系，一个文档和知识库产品，蚂蚁为什么要持续砸钱，跟主要做支付和理财工具的支付宝又是什么关系？包括语雀说要「为每一个人，为每一个团队，提供优秀的文档和知识库工具」，那语雀到底是2B还是2C的，怎么看待文档类产品天花板和频次问题，都是灵魂拷问。但好在玉伯和镜同两位同学非常坦诚，完全没有回避这些问题，聊得非常透彻，推荐从业者、产研同学还有想在大厂内部创业的朋友关注这次对话。

**Cloud IDE 的迷茫与希望**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/AJTGkBqbKAOIAcH0slsrDg  
软件工程的下一个大时代是什么？人工智能写代码吗？Copilot 很成功，但依然是辅助。人工智能写代码就跟全自动驾驶一样，我持保留意见。我更相信软件工程的下一步是云端开发，Cloud Development。我们一定需要一个 Cloud IDE，但目前 Cloud IDE 的问题跟 PDA 类似，杂糅了太多当前 IDE 的特征。我相信未来云端开发的 IDE 一定不是现在 IDE 的样子。微软收购 Github 以后做的一个跟云结合的大动作是 CodeSpace。你说 CodeSpace 算不算 Cloud IDE？Github 这么大的用户量，事实上 CodeSpace 的用量也就一般。而且 CodeSpace 还可以对接桌面版的 VS Code，也就是 Web 形态的 IDE 并不是核心。这里多说一句，只要还是人类在写代码，就需要编辑器。目前的编辑器技术都是国外团队做的，比如 Monaco，ACE，Code Mirror。我们去年找遍了没有在国内找到一个做编辑器的团队。另附：[Will low and no code tools ever truly disrupt tech development?](https://stackoverflow.blog/2022/08/10/will-low-and-no-code-tools-ever-truly-disrupt-tech-development/)、[加条斜杠，一起成为独立开发者 | 706 无代码共学招募](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/bPu9XPL85aZpz0PvsOYmug)。

**The State of end-to-end testing with Angular**  
https://blog.angular.io/the-state-of-end-to-end-testing-with-angular-d175f751cb9c  
In the Angular v12 release blog post we announced plans to investigate the future of Protractor. Based on community feedback via the RFC process, we’ve decided to deprecate Protractor, while working with the community to find a long term support option for active projects that wish to continue using Protractor.

**如何打造伟大的产品与公司 - 《Build》读书笔记**  
https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/549795452  
https://github.com/zijie0/HumanSystemOptimization  
最近读了 Tony Fadell 2022 年的新书《Build》，很受震撼。Tony 本身就是一个业界传奇人物，主导了 iPod，iPhone 的打造，后来还一手创办了 Nest，引领了智能家居市场的诞生发展。在《Build》这本书里，大佬从个人职业发展开始聊起，再讲到打造极致的产品，杰出的团队和组织，创办建设一家世界级的公司，成为 CEO 的各种心路历程和经验总结，可谓是精彩纷呈。看完这本书，还特地把手机换成了 iPhone，向伟大的产品和公司致敬！这本书的信息量实在非常大，其中穿插了很多很有意思的故事，不同的人读或者在不同的职业阶段读可能都会有很不一样的感受和收获，相信我自己后面也会反复重读。这里先简单记录一下本次阅读的一些读书笔记，与大家一起分享讨论。另附：[Learnings of a CEO: Wade Foster, Zapier](https://www.ycombinator.com/blog/learnings-of-a-ceo-wade-foster-zapier/)。

**How and why we removed jQuery from GOV.UK**  
https://insidegovuk.blog.gov.uk/2022/08/11/how-and-why-we-removed-jquery-from-gov-uk/  
For a long time our frontend code on www.gov.uk - the publishing domain for GOV.UK - has been dependent on an outdated version of jQuery, a library designed to make writing JavaScript easier. Here’s how and why we decided to remove jQuery, and what the results have been.

**What is Component-Driven Prototyping?**  
https://www.uxpin.com/studio/blog/what-is-component-driven-prototyping/  
Component-driven prototyping is the next iteration of user experience design. Designers no longer design from scratch, and engineers write less code. The result? Better cross-functional collaboration, faster time-to-market, superior consistency, fewer errors, better testing, meaningful stakeholder feedback, and smoother design handoffs.

**How we made the Vercel Dashboard twice as fast**

We were able to confirm that our improvements had a real impact on our users over time using Vercel Analytics, noting that our Vercel Analytics scores went from 90 to 95 on average (desktop). Let’s review the techniques and strategies we used so you can make a data-driven impact on your application.

**How To Use Multithreading in Node.js**  
https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-multithreading-in-node-js  
In this tutorial, you’ll create a Node.js app with a CPU-intensive task that blocks the main thread. Next, you will use the worker-threads module to offload the CPU-intensive task to another thread to avoid blocking the main thread. Finally, you will divide the CPU-bound task and have four threads work on it in parallel to speed up the task.

**How Instagram suggests new content**

**Recreating “The Effects of Nuclear Weapons” for the Web**  
https://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2022/08/09/recreating-the-effects-of-nuclear-weapons-for-the-web/  
In my previous post, I wrote about a way to center elements based on their content, without forcing the element to be a specific width, while preserving the interior text alignment.  In this post, I’d like to talk about why I developed that technique.

**Why the future of serverless databases is distributed document-relational.**  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AHUt8xIwp8  
https://redmonk.com/jgovernor/2022/08/10/a-redmonk-conversation-why-the-future-of-serverless-databases-is-distributed-document-relational/  
https://docs.fauna.com/fauna/current/learn/introduction/document_relational  
We recently spoke to Fauna about what the company is seeing in terms of flexible database services for modern application development, and why it’s calling its approach Document-relational. As we move to a world where developers increasingly build applications using cloud-based managed services with clean APIs the database is, as ever, up for grabs as a strategic and tactical choice. Managed databases are becoming ever more sophisticated, and relational databases are undergoing a renaissance.  GraphQL, Data Governance, ACID compliance with schema flexibility - are becoming table stakes.

**How to design an effective relational database [Updated 2022]**

**Why Does gRPC Insist on Trailers?**  
https://carlmastrangelo.com/blog/why-does-grpc-insist-on-trailers  
gRPC comes up occasionally on the Orange Site, often with a redress of grievences in the comment section. One of the major complaints people have with gRPC is that it requires HTTP trailers. This one misstep has caused so much heartache and trouble, I think it probably is the reason gRPC failed to achieve its goal. Since I was closely involved with the project, I wanted to rebut some misconceptions I see posted a lot, and warn future protocol designers against the mistakes we made.

**how to stop being "terminally online"**  
https://nights.bearblog.dev/how-to-stop-being-terminally-online/  
the general consensus lot of these popular sites these days seems to be acknowledge things like tracking and content aggregation while wanting to not pay it any mind. continued users of these sites put on a face of pseudo self-awareness at their continued use of a site they claim to hate while flinging unintentionally self-deprecating accusations to those concluded to be engaging in overly serious use. at the end of the day, this mindset is one of begrudging acceptance of the circumstances. "this website is so bad, but we're still on it, because this is where everything is, and there's nothing we can really do about it."

**I replaced all our blog thumbnails using DALL·E 2 for $45: here’s what I learne**  
https://deephaven.io/blog/2022/08/08/AI-generated-blog-thumbnails/  
I found that once I found ones I liked, I tended to reuse a lot of the same stylistic modifiers along the way. It made me wonder if we should develop a consistent style for our blog, so all our images look like a related set, or have a signature style. But how do you even have a signature style when it is the AI generating your images? How will this change art? Will it make news photos impossible to trust? I don’t know the answer to any of those questions. Releated: [I spent $15 in DALL·E 2 credits creating this AI image, and here’s what I learned](https://pub.towardsai.net/i-spent-15-in-dall-e-2-credits-creating-this-ai-image-and-heres-what-i-learned-52f352912025).

“Projects” was one of the core themes of our 2022 roadmap planning session and we spent a lot of time discussing what features we should work on to meaningfully improve this part of the Linear experience. Project Updates wasn’t part of our initial list of things to build. It slowly emerged as a problem space that we should tackle as we were building other things. Here’s what happened.

**左脚游民，右脚定居**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/Ubus1G6odol7QC4j8gEFNQ  
数字游民之所以来势汹汹，必然是符合了人性中广泛且永恒的一部分真理，那就是对自己生活的掌控。互联网工具使得越来越多的人意识到八小时固定地点工作制像是一场雇主和社会合谋的骗局：你本来就不需要那么多的工作时间，你也不需要每天去同一个地方才能工作。从通勤和做饭等琐事中省出来的时间被愉快地用到了闲聊上。可别小看闲聊，这正是社区的催化剂：埋头做事的只能是个体，只有开始交流了，群体才质变成为社区。

**我们如何对自己进行自我管理**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/GS5SjC1LNVZGWA5V2yYfMw  
知识工作者必须成为自己的 CEO，因为多数公司并不怎么在乎员工的发展。要干出好成绩，不仅仅是需要清楚自己的优缺点，也要知道怎么学习新知识，如何与别人共处，以及自己的价值观和擅长点。我们很少会像父辈一样 20 多岁开始工作，用一门手艺在一家公司待到终老。我们的年龄往往比许多组织年龄都长，这就意味着我们必须投资自己的未来，以确保下半生能持续的获得良好的收益。
