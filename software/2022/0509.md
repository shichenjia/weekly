**Why I don't miss React: a story about using the platform**  
https://www.jackfranklin.co.uk/blog/working-with-react-and-the-web-platform/  
This blog post should be read as the musings of someone who went from working with React every day to not touching it, and the experiences of doing so. I am writing this post because I have been pleasantly surprised on how much I've enjoyed working more closely with the web platform. Releated:  
- [The Story of Concurrent React](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZoRlVi3MjQ)  
- [How I fell in love with low-js](https://edofic.com/posts/2022-01-28-low-js/), https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31249181   
- [You Don’t Need A UI Framework](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2022/05/you-dont-need-ui-framework/)  
- [I Love Ember. Our Team Decided to Switch To React. And I’m Ecstatic](https://medium.com/ashtech/i-love-ember-our-team-decided-to-switch-to-react-and-im-ecstatic-3eef66f01bd)

**JavaScript Containers**  
https://tinyclouds.org/javascript_containers  
The more we can remove unnecessary abstractions, the closer we can get to the concept of “The Network Is the Computer”. Cloudflare Workers is essentially an implementation of this concept in the Cloudflare network. Deno Deploy is a new implementation of this idea (on the GCP network). In this post I’ll describe how I think about JavaScript Containers and speculate about how this technology will unfold over the next couple years.

**Third Age of JavaScript - Three Years In**  
https://www.swyx.io/third-age-2022  
For the first time, I presented an updated version of my Third Age of JS talk at Reactathon 2022 this past week. The full talk is available on livestream and I will update this post when the separate video is out.

**Xilem: an architecture for UI in Rust**  
https://raphlinus.github.io/rust/gui/2022/05/07/ui-architecture.html  
Like most modern UI architectures, Xilem is based on a view tree which is a simple declarative description of the UI. For incremental update, successive versions of the view tree are diffed, and the results are applied to a widget tree which is more of a traditional retained-mode UI. Xilem also contains at heart an incremental computation engine with precise change propagation, specialized for UI use.

**React Native Skia—For Us, For You, and For Fun**  
https://shopify.engineering/react-native-skia-shopify  
Our goal with this project is twofold. First we want to provide React Native, which is notorious for its limited graphical capabilities, with a set of powerful 2D drawing primitives that are consistent across iOS, Android, and the Web.  Second is to bridge the gap between graphic designers and React Native: by providing the same UI capabilities as a tool like Figma. Everyone can now speak the same language.

**GraphQL is a Trap?**  
https://xuorig.medium.com/graphql-is-a-trap-e83ca380aa8f  
GraphQL doesn’t need terrible SQL queries. In fact I’m very curious to how the author got there. That’s not typically the kind of queries a GraphQL execution results in. If anything, naively implemented, GraphQL results in a ton of small queries for every resolver. With dataloader, it looks like a smaller set of queries (a lot of them being SELECT ... WHERE ... IN queries). Nested queries in queries and unbounded joins is what I’d expect if someone was trying to build resolvers that look ahead or using some sort of GraphQL-to-SQL auto generation. Just not something I’ve seen often in real life.

**[译]微前端的未来**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/NeKJ4EPnhrJ-GnTGs9MakA  
从 2021 年年底到 2022 年最初的几周里，我花了一些时间来研究微前端到目前为止的发展情况。我分析了让团队陷入挣扎的不同挑战，长期以来导致耦合的反模式，以及用于解决这些问题常用的模式。在这篇文章中，我将分享一些想法和趋势，它们可能会在微前端社区引发一些有趣的讨论。

**Embracing a Docs-as-Code approach**  
https://engineering.grab.com/doc-as-code  
The Docs-as-Code concept has been gaining traction in the past few years as more tech companies start implementing this approach. One of the most widely-known examples is Spotify, that ​​uses Docs-as-Code to publish documentation in an internal developer portal. Since the start of 2021, Grab has also adopted a Docs-as-Code approach to improve our technical documentation. Before we talk about how this is done at Grab, let’s explain what this concept really means.

**The Thing About Fastify**  
https://hire.jonasgalvez.com.br/2022/may/02/the-thing-about-fastify/  
On the surface, there aren't many practical differences between setting up web servers in Express and Fastify — they both let you register handlers for specific URLs, they both let you chain middleware functions inbetween requests. But there's a whole lot more Fastify can do, things like logging, validation and serialization, that's all offered out of the box. The articles I linked above are good starting points on learning about them, and they also cover some of the various smart things Fastify does when it comes to performance. I won't go over all of them again. I'll focus instead on the things that are the most significant to me, that really make a difference, followed by some closing thoughts.

**Porting Zelda Classic to the Web**  
https://hoten.cc/blog/porting-zelda-classic-to-the-web/  
I ported Zelda Classic (a game engine based on the original Zelda) to the web. You can play it here–grab a gamepad if you have one! It's a PWA, so you can also install it. I've written some background information on Zelda Classic, and chronicled the technical process of porting a large C++ codebase to the web using WebAssembly.

**A vision for Decentraland's next 5 years**  
https://maraoz.com/2022/05/04/decentraland-vision/  
The following are my personal views (again, I’m not part of the Decentraland Foundation). I’ll be candid and straightforward, tackling the platform’s main problems head on. Some ideas are mine. Some ideas are spoken in hushed tones among Decentraland community members, afraid to risk proposing crazy stuff. I hope that sharing my 5 year vision sparks strategic discussions and inspires our community to take Decentraland to the next level. After that, we can use the DAO to vote popular proposals into protocol rules.

**What are your Most Used Self Hosted Applications?**  
https://noted.lol/what-are-your-most-used-self-hosted-applications/  
A question that comes up quite a bit in the Self Hosted communities is "What Self Hosted applications do you use most?" This question alone has been the reason I discover so many new applications I never knew I needed. Perhaps I can do the same for you by sharing my most used self hosted applications.

**The Go Programming Language and Environment**  
https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2022/5/260357-the-go-programming-language-and-environment/fulltext  
Go is a programming language created at Google in late 2007 and released as open source in November 2009. Since then, it has operated as a public project, with contributions from thousands of individuals and dozens of companies. Go has become a popular language for building cloud infrastructure: Docker, a Linux container manager, and Kubernetes, a container deployment system, are core cloud technologies written in Go. Today, Go is the foundation for critical infrastructure at every major cloud provider and is the implementation language for most projects hosted at the Cloud Native Computing Foundation.

**Lerna has gone. Which Monorepo is right for a Node.js BACKEND now?**  
https://medium.com/autodesk-tlv/lerna-has-gone-which-monorepo-is-right-for-a-node-js-backend-fc075cad51b0  
This post is concerned with backend-only and Node.js. It also scoped to typical business solutions. If you’re Google/FB developer who is faced with 8,000 packages — Sorry, you need special gear. Consequently, monster Monorepo tooling like Bazel is left-out. We will cover here some of the most popular Monorepo tools including Turborepo, Nx, PNPM, Yarn/npm workspace, and Lerna (although it’s not actually maintained anymore — it’s a good baseline for comparison).

**Delta: A highly available, strongly consistent storage service using chain replication**  
https://engineering.fb.com/2022/05/04/data-infrastructure/delta/  
In this post, we will discuss the goals for Delta, the main concepts that govern Delta’s architecture, Delta’s production use cases, its evolution as a recovery provider, and future work items.

**Distributed Systems Shibboleths**  
https://jolynch.github.io/posts/distsys_shibboleths/  
Shibboleths are historically a word or phrasing that indicate membership in a particular group or culture. I was introduced to the term in the West Wing where the President needed to verify the veracity of a person’s claims of religious persecution. I am still a relatively new engineer in the field of distributed systems, having only studied and worked in the field for around a decade, but in that time I believe I have learned to recognize some key “distsys shibboleths” that help me recognize when I can trust what a vendor or other engineer is telling me.

**Rethinking Human-in-the-Loop for Artificial Augmented Intelligence**  
https://bair.berkeley.edu/blog/2022/05/03/human-in-the-loop/  
How do we build and evaluate an AI system for real-world applications? In most AI research, the evaluation of AI methods involves a training-validation-testing process. The experiments usually stop when the models have good testing performance on the reported datasets because real-world data distribution is assumed to be modeled by the validation and testing data. However, real-world applications are usually more complicated than a single training-validation-testing process. The biggest difference is the ever-changing data.

**7GUIs: A GUI Programming Benchmark**  
https://eugenkiss.github.io/7guis/  
There are countless GUI toolkits in different languages and with diverse approaches to GUI development. Yet, diligent comparisons between them are rare. Whereas in a traditional benchmark competing implementations are compared in terms of their resource consumption, here implementations are compared in terms of their notation. To that end, 7GUIs defines seven tasks that represent typical challenges in GUI programming. In addition, 7GUIs provides a recommended set of evaluation dimensions.

Calling our company Basecamp just doesn't make a lot of sense when we make more than just Basecamp. We're headed back to a different time — one where we invented more, created more, and carved new marks into tired markets. And with that, we need a new name. Or, rather, an old one.

**The future of the web: policy pathways to an online world for everyone**  
https://webfoundation.org/2022/05/the-future-of-the-web-policy-pathways-to-an-online-world-for-everyone/  
This was also the day that the United States and 60 governments chose to launch their Declaration for the Future of the Internet, for online spaces that are “open, free, global, interoperable, reliable, and secure” and, we would respectfully include, are affordable and provide meaningful access for everyone. The web should be a place where creativity flourishes and innovation thrives; but far too frequently, our online world is a space that brings harm to vulnerable communities. As a research-driven policy organization, we at the Web Foundation are encouraged by this Declaration, and by other legal frameworks proliferating around the world. Here’s a look at initiatives that seek to drive the future of the web toward its intended goal of being for everyone.  

**Preserving Wilmington History on the Web**  
http://blog.archive.org/2022/05/03/preserving-wilmington-history-on-the-web/  
Why is Community Webs important? Because it will help to remember when we cannot keep up with the information overload. Because there is so much happening that we miss a good deal of what is around us – or can’t bear to face it for long. Because so very very much of our lives are now online – and can be erased with a keystroke. Because we are seeing, painfully, that those who do not learn from the past will be/are condemned to re-live it.

**苹果「大统一」是如何破产的**  
http://www.geekpark.net/news/301829  
早在乔布斯时代，苹果一直崇尚用简洁易懂的方式满足用户需求。面对问题，苹果更愿意提供一个「标准答案」，而不是多个「可行解」。这种宗旨，即「用相同方式设计不同产品」，被称为苹果产品的「大统一理论」（The Grand Unified Theory）。2015 年前后，苹果曾对外透露了这样一个「理论」的存在。但这套理论已经破产，最近出版的书《After Steve》（乔布斯之后）提供了一些新的内幕。故事的主角，就是前苹果首席设计官，Jony Ive。Ive 将一个美妙的理想，带进了死胡同，并最终迷失在时代的浪潮里

“哲学是每个时代最庄严的守护，守护在价值的根基处。”杨立华说，当今这个时代最缺的是沉静的、深入的思考。而思考已成为他的一种习惯——随时随地都在思考，看电影时、读小说时、看球赛时、听音乐时，甚至教育孩子时。也因为此，在家人眼中，他总是心不在焉，和他说话常常驴唇不对马嘴。“在重要的地方，我都要有道理来安顿，不然会心有不安。这就要持续不断地追问和思考，尝试着以思考来面对一切问题。”杨立华说。
