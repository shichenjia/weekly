**Four Eras of JavaScript Frameworks**  
https://www.pzuraq.com/blog/four-eras-of-javascript-frameworks  
Today the debates rage on: Has the web grown too bloated? Does the average website really need to be written in React? Should we even use JavaScript at all? I don’t think we can see into the future here, and in the end I suspect we’ll probably discover that once again, we were talking past each other and missing the bigger picture. But maybe getting a bit of perspective from the past will help us to move forward.

**Noto emoji, a new black and white emoji font with less color**  
https://developers.googleblog.com/2022/04/what-is-black-and-white-and-read-all.html  
In 1999 — back when Snake 🐍 was the best thing about your phone 📱 — there were three phone carriers in Japan 🗾 . On these phones were tiny, beautiful pictures called emoji (meaning “picture” and “character” in Japanese 🥰). These 176 images were very simple — think 8-bit tech — and as a result were exquisitely abstract and tremendously useful when texting ✨ Twenty years later 👶🕛🕐🕑🕒🕓🕔🕕🕖🕗🕘🕙🕚🧓, emoji are a global phenomenon 🌎. Now, our phones have fancy retina screens and somewhere along the way an important part of what made emoji so handy was left by the wayside: their simplicity. That’s why we’ve created a new emoji font: a monochrome Noto Emoji (a black and white companion to Noto Emoji Color).

**The Future of Search Is Boutique**  
https://future.a16z.com/the-future-of-search-is-boutique/  
I believe the opportunity in search is not to attack Google head-on with a massive, one-size-fits-all horizontal aggregator, but instead to build boutique search engines that index, curate, and organize things in new ways.

**Towards Access Control Models for Conversational User Interfaces**  
https://modeling-languages.com/chatbot-access-control-conversational-user-interfaces/  
Our work, to be presented at EMMSAD’22, proposes to enrich CUI definitions with access-control primitives to enable the definition of more secure CUIs. Our solution is based on the use of model-driven techniques to raise the abstraction level at which the CUIs (and the access-control extensions) are defined. This facilitates the generation of such secure CUIs on top of different development platforms. In particular, we extend our generic CUI language with new access-control modeling primitives adapted to the CUI domain and show how this extended models can be enforced as part of a policy evaluation component.

**Design-First Approach to API Development: How to Implement and Why It Works**  
https://www.infoq.com/articles/design-first-api-development/  
With this rapid growth of the API industry, it follows that more developers and technology leaders both need to know how to make these efforts successful. Increasingly, folks in these essential roles need to understand what it takes to build out a solid, successful, scalable API program that will drive business value. Where do you start? What are the most important factors to consider? There is complexity for sure, but I'm here to tell you that the most important factor to consider is getting started with a design-first approach to your API strategy. As developers, we can have the next API masterpiece at our fingertips; we just have to design it first.

固有的思维依然在人们的脑海挥之不去，但世界却在笃定变化着。人们从互联网、金融、艺术等行业“涌进”这一赛道，把区块链技术融进产品，把DAO的思维放进公司，将Web3文化接入数字社会。这是一场已经持续了10年的“迁徙”，而大部队才刚刚动身。

**How We Reduced Startup Time by 80% With Webpack**  
https://www.rudderstack.com/blog/how-we-reduced-startup-time-by-80-with-webpack/  
An example of this not-so-good developer experience is when deployment times for Control Plane's primary backend service got excessively long. It used to take 5 minutes to deploy in production. More importantly, it took anywhere from 40-90 seconds, depending on hardware, to restart during development. This became a major pain point, slowing progress for our team, so we knew it was time to refocus and solve the problem. Here’s how we did it.

**Opinion: When should a software engineer switch into management?**  
https://www.etsy.com/codeascraft/opinion-when-should-a-software-engineer-switch-into-management  
Alot of talented management bloggers before me have focused on who should make the transition to engineering management, and what that job entails, and how to be successful once you’ve made the switch. But recently a team member came to me with a different spin on the question: if you already know that management is for you, when should you make the switch from software engineer to manager? To help answer this question, your level of interest in programming is actually a more useful indicator than your level of interest in management.

**11 Principles of Engineering Management**  
https://acjay.com/2022/03/11/11-principles-of-engineering-management/  
More than 2 years ago, I decided to try to create a brief, digestible manual on the expectations of management for senior engineers at my company who are considering making the shift. At the time, I had about 3 years of management experience, including two prior companies. Enough to feel like I knew how to do the job, but not enough to feel like I should be some kind of authority on management. After letting this marinate for a couple years, I’m ready to share what I have learned.

**一位嵌入式前辈 8 年的工作总结**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/sGd4-qrMuK3UXjOTSyUvzg  
今年终于从大菊花厂离职了，离职前收入大概60w不到吧！在某乎属于比较差的，今天终于有空写一下自己的职场故事，也算是给自己近8年的工作做个总结复盘。近8年有些事情做对了，也有更多事情做错了，在这里记录一下，希望能够给后人一些帮助吧。文笔不好，见谅，有些细节记不清了，如果有出入，就当是我编的这个故事吧。

推荐是忠诚度最好的指标之一，因为客户愿意拿自己的声誉去冒险。当我们只有 NPS 值的时候，下一步做什么就很明确了：那些愿意推荐的人是为什么狂热，而那些贬损的人为何不满意，如何将贬损者减少，让推荐者增加，便成了明确的行动方向。

**真正的养生是养什么？**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/kdvAXf1scuAKtYpUqHF-Sg  
养生要破局，首先是从有涯里面突破出来才能看到，才能体会到无涯，我们才能知道为什么要做日行一善，为什么讲德。德养不了身体，但它能养性，它能养生命的本原，也只有到这个层面我们才有可能谈薪火相传。我们为什么要为人民服务？因为生命的这个层面是需要为人民服务的。你付出的越多，反过来你得到的越多。跟身体层面完全相反，身体的层面你给人家越多，你就越少，对不对？而在心性的层面你付出得越多，你的心一定会越来越安，你才有可能去体证到这个生命的本原。另附：[世间最好的养生：善忘、少怨、不比、寡思](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/2fQsOhEmWWjWJqT6RnG35A)。
