**What’s next for AI**  
https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/12/23/1065852/whats-next-for-ai/  
Get a head start with our four big bets for 2023.

**The End of Programming**  
https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2023/1/267976-the-end-of-programming/fulltext  
Programming will be obsolete. I believe the conventional idea of "writing a program" is headed for extinction, and indeed, for all but very specialized applications, most software, as we know it, will be replaced by AI systems that are trained rather than programmed. In situations where one needs a "simple" program (after all, not everything should require a model of hundreds of billions of parameters running on a cluster of GPUs), those programs will, themselves, be generated by an AI rather than coded by hand.

**From models-to-code to models-to-prompts: the next MDE revolution?**  
https://modeling-languages.com/models-to-code-models-to-prompts/  
As all of you, I’ve also been playing with ChatGPT. I’ve tried it to generate code and models from simple prompts. With impressive but mixed results. ChatGPT will NOT definitely replace programmers. Even less modelers. But it still may revolutionize software development, especially, model-driven software development. In this post, I explain how.

**The Year in Computer Science**  
https://www.quantamagazine.org/the-biggest-discoveries-in-computer-science-in-2022-20221221/  
Computer scientists this year learned how to transmit perfect secrets, why transformers seem so good at everything, and how to improve on decades-old algorithms (with a little help from AI).

**Apple, Google, and Mozilla are teaming up to make a next-gen browser benchmark**  
https://www.theverge.com/2022/12/16/23511461/apple-google-mozilla-chrome-safari-firefox-browser-speedtest-3  
Apple, Google, and Mozilla, the makers of Safari, Chrome, and Firefox, are teaming up to create a next-gen browser benchmark called Speedometer 3, according to tweets from all three companies. This means that the major players in the web browser and rendering engine space will have a say in a benchmark that’s meant to test how their apps perform with the latest tech that websites may be using.

**Dangerous examples of technical debt in rich text editors**  
https://www.tiny.cloud/blog/technical-debt-examples/  
In an ideal world, the technical debt in your project is intentional and controllable. But rich text editors are complex beasts that exist in an ever-changing environment – which means one of the biggest dangers to rich text editor development is environmental tech debt.

**2022 Roundup of Web Research**  
https://css-tricks.com/2022-roundup-of-web-research/  
Last year, it seemed the overarching trend was around remote work and its impact on developer productivity and workplace environments. We also saw TailwindCSS continue to explode in usage, dismal accessibility on the top 1 million websites, and a massive growth in API usage, among other findings. So, what’s in store for this year? Read on to find out.

**Bad performance is bad accessibility**  
https://brucelawson.co.uk/2022/bad-performance-is-bad-accessibility/  
What is “accessibility”? For some, it’s about ensuring that your sites and apps don’t block people with disabilities from completing tasks. That’s the main part of it, but in my opinion it’s not all of the story. Accessibility, to me, means taking care to develop digital services that are inclusive as possible. That means inclusive of people with disabilities, of people outside Euro-centric cultures, and people who don’t have expensive, top-the-range hardware and always-on cheap fast networks.

**WebAssembly: Docker without containers!**  
https://wasmlabs.dev/articles/docker-without-containers/  
This article will explain what is WebAssembly, why it is relevant to the Docker ecosystem and provide some hands-on examples to try on. We assume you are familiar with the Docker tooling. We will be using our work on the WebAssembly port of PHP to demonstrate how to build a PHP interpreter, package it as part of an OCI image and run it using Docker.

**Comprehensive Rust**  
https://google.github.io/comprehensive-rust/  
This is a four day Rust course developed by the Android team. The course covers the full spectrum of Rust, from basic syntax to advanced topics like generics and error handling. It also includes Android-specific content on the last day.

**Circuit Breakers**  
https://architecturenotes.co/circuit-breakers/  
Circuit breakers are a vital component of any distributed system, helping to improve reliability and resilience by preventing failures from cascading and causing widespread damage.

**Copilot Internals**  
https://thakkarparth007.github.io/copilot-explorer/posts/copilot-internals.html  
In this post, I try to answer specific questions about the internals of Copilot, while also describing some interesting observations I made as I combed through the code. I will provide pointers to the relevant code for almost everything I talk about, so that interested folks can take a look at the code themselves.

**Product vs. Policy**  
https://www.svpg.com/product-vs-policy/  
Most people today know that when we refer to “product,” we mean that in a very holistic sense.  It’s not just the code.  It’s not just the user interface.  It’s not just the app.  It is meant to reflect the full customer experience.  Online and offline.  Customer facing and customer enabling.

**How top companies are handling virtual wellness**

https://www.niemanlab.org/2022/12/this-is-the-year-of-the-rss-reader-really/  
With using Twitter becoming increasingly like smoking — a habit you can’t quit but know you should — there’s a chance that a better RSS reader will finally, finally take hold and scale.

**New Wave: Second Brain Note-Taking**  
https://blog.standardnotes.com/41254/new-wave-second-brain-note-taking
https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34034414
As a company that provides a simple and secure note-taking app, Standard Notes has often been lumped in with the various "second brain" or productivity tools that have become popular in recent years. While these tools can certainly be useful for some people, we have always taken a different approach.  Our philosophy is simple: the first step to getting things done is to simply start doing them. We don't claim to have any magic solution or secret cure for productivity. We just offer a simple and secure platform for you to do your best work.

张仲景在自己写的《伤寒卒病论集》里说的话，和我们现在的社会现实多么的相似，简直就是现在的翻版，一模一样。
