It’s an exciting time for CSS! It feels like new features are being added every day. And yet, through it all, CSS has managed to remain an accessible language for anyone making websites. Is this an inevitable part of the design of CSS? Or has CSS been formed by chance? Let’s take a look at the history—and some alternative histories—of the World Wide Web to better understand where we are today. And then, let’s cast our gaze to the future!

**Reading Source Code: React**  
https://alexkondov.com/readint-source-code-react/  
Before you continue reading, I have to mention that this is not meant to be an exhaustive overview of how React works under the hook. In fact, some of my assumptions about that will probably be wrong. I will focus on the design of the codebase instead. We’ll see what practices and patterns the React core team has applied to a piece of software used by countless engineers. Hopefully, we can draw inspiration from their decisions.

**Comparing the Effort of Developing Enterprise Applications with Programming and with Domain-Specific Modeling**  
https://modeling-languages.com/comparing-the-effort-of-developing-enterprise-applications-with-programming-and-with-domain-specific-modeling/  
The result of the comparison shows over 500% productivity for domain-specific modeling compared to manual programming: A week’s workload could thus be reduced to less than one working day. This result is similar to what other companies have reported across a variety of domains, showing that the same results apply to the domain of web-based enterprise applications.

**JavaScript SDK “Package Size is Massive” - So we reduced it by 29%**  
https://blog.sentry.io/2022/07/19/javascript-sdk-package-reduced  
Developers started to notice just how big our JavaScript package was and yeah, we knew. We weren’t ignoring the issues; after all, we don’t want the Sentry package to be the cause of a slowdown. But to reduce our JavaScript SDK package size effectively we had to account for shipping new capabilities, like being able to manage the health of a release and performance monitoring, while maintaining a manageable bundle size. After all, new features == bigger package - usually.

阿里妈妈前端快爆从 2017 年开始，已坚持更新到 2022 年。过去 5 年间，我们致力于传达前端业界的更迭，也慢慢分化出来了重客观信息的新闻版块、重知识聚合的专题板块、重碎片化分享的百宝箱板块。2021 的年度盘点我们选择了一个特别的形式，把时间范围拉长到 10 年，梳理前端工具链里的 12 个重要的包的发布和版本更新时间，结合 npm 下载数据，看看前端的工具链在这十年间有怎样的演变。

**CSS font-palette与彩色字体显示**  
https://www.zhangxinxu.com/wordpress/2022/07/css-font-palette/  
所谓彩色字体，指的是那些内部自带彩色字形的字体，例如 Adobe 出品的 Gilbert 字体。彩色字体实际上浏览器很早就支持了，如果当前字体采用的是 COLR/CPAL(v0) 标准制作的，则包括 IE9（需要 Windows 8.1+） 在内的浏览器均是支持的。

**工程效能CI/CD之流水线引擎的建设实践**  
https://tech.meituan.com/2022/07/14/cicd-pipeline.html  
经过3年左右的建设打磨，流水线引擎完成了服务端的基建统一，涵盖到店、到家、大众点评、美团优选、美团平台、自动配送车、基础研发平台等几乎所有的业务，支持Java、C++、NodeJS、Golang等多种语言。在性能和稳定性方面，引擎每日支撑近十万次的流水线执行量（作业调度峰值每小时达上万次），系统成功率保持在99.99%以上（排除业务代码自身原因和第三方工具的问题）。下面我们主要介绍下我们在自研引擎建设上遇到的挑战以及对应的解决方案。

**Design patterns for asynchronous API communication**  
https://stackoverflow.blog/2022/07/21/event-driven-topic-design-using-kafka/  
An event-driven architecture can reduce dependencies, increase safety, and make your application easy to scale. But designing your systems and topics is a non-trivial task

**Soft Deletion Probably Isn't Worth It**  
https://brandur.org/soft-deletion  
The concept behind soft deletion is to make deletion safer, and reversible. Once a record’s been hit by a hard DELETE, it may technically still be recoverable by digging down into the storage layer, but suffice it to say that it’s really hard to get back. But this technique has some major downsides.

**I Regret My $46k Website Redesign**  
https://mtlynch.io/tinypilot-redesign/  
Two years ago, I created a website for my business. By combining my terrible design skills with a decent-looking template, I created a site that looked okay. I told myself that if the business took off, I’d hire a real designer to make it look professional.

**Advocate, educator, and authorial stance**  
https://martinfowler.com/articles/authorial-stance.html  
Whenever I'm working with someone who's spending a lot of time explaining the problems of an established approach, I try to nudge them into the trade-offs or merits stances instead. Which direction to go depends on what author wants to produce, and what they are up for - but either is a step up from the advocate stance.

**Thoughts on RSS**  
https://matt-rickard.com/thoughts-on-rss/  
No technology other than RSS has had more think pieces written proclaiming the death of RSS (2006, 2009, 2010, 2012, 2013) and the rebirth of RSS (2009, 2010, 2011, 2018, 2018, 2019). Really Simple Syndication (RSS) is a protocol that lets you subscribe to website updates – e.g., new blog posts, podcasts, or anything else. Today, most podcasts are distributed via RSS.

**Perspective (角度)**  
https://www.yuque.com/tianzhou/bb/perspective  
优秀的产品设计者可以一秒变傻，讲的就是要切换到用户的角度。但这不仅仅是去脑补用户的使用行为，还要推演用户表现这种使用行为背后的原因。比如 Bytebase 从国内用户里偶尔会收到的一个反馈是设计不符合国人习惯，这个反馈的背后就要去分析，背后的原因可能是：1. 产品本身设计有问题，但这个不分国内外。2. 产品本身设计合理，但确实是没有符合用户习惯。碰到 2 就要再进一步思考，是不是要向用户妥协，还是说坚持自己，去引导用户。这个把握比较的艰难，需要从不同的 Perspective 反复看这个问题，而能找到不同的 Perspective，靠的又是长期积累的行业经验。

**Linus 这 6 件鲜为人知的趣事**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/wHwud62qW_nS-x5dmFuzww
Linux 能取得今天的成功，最主要的原因是我们最终获得了所有的商业利益，而技术社区常见的一种心态——被极客创造、为极客服务、只提供给技术用户，会阻碍获取商业利益。对一个项目进行「技术价值与商业利益」的一体化考量是大有益处的。一个只考虑商业利益的公司不会生产出好的产品，只看重技术价值对产品来说也不是好的发展策略。

**不读书当然愚蠢，但因为读书而滋生出骄傲与傲慢更愚蠢**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/Pp28R4as389VbRg2w9oBQw
“智力”与“智慧”是两码事。很多智力出众的人不一定有智慧，有很多智力发达的人，其实都非常愚昧。我有限的精力和经验提醒我，读书也许有四个维度，或者说四种境界。在书籍中逃避世界：逃避可能有用，但现实世界的困境并不会因为逃避而消失。在书籍中营造世界：想象毕竟只是想象，我们在书籍中获得的完美，在现实世界中依然不完美。在书籍中理解世界：每一部伟大的作品，都会让你更多地认识自己，理解自己。当我们越多地理解世界，我们也就越多地理解自己。在书籍中超越世界：如果书籍无法赋予我们对抗黑暗的力量，那么，读书就毫无意义。
