**Introducing Turbopack: Rust-based successor to Webpack**  
https://vercel.com/blog/turbopack  
Turbopack is built on a new incremental architecture for the fastest possible development experience. On large applications, it shows updates 10x faster than Vite and 700x faster than Webpack. On even larger applications, the difference is greater—often 20x faster than Vite. Unless you're big into Next.js, stick with your existing tools.

**State of IPFS in JS**  
https://blog.ipfs.tech/state-of-ipfs-in-js/  
JavaScript (and its typed variant TypeScript) is the most ubiquitous programming language with the largest community of developers. Our goal is to enable all those developers to reap the benefits of IPFS and do so productively. This blog entry intends to give an update on what is happening with IPFS development in JS. It’s been a while since we’ve done this, so there’s a lot to cover. This is the first update of more to come. It isn’t a full roadmap, but we aim to give clarity to some of the history of IPFS development in JS, decisions by some maintainers on what to do going forward, and ways you can help.

**From zero to 10 million lines of Kotlin**  
https://engineering.fb.com/2022/10/24/android/android-java-kotlin-migration/  
In recent years, Kotlin has become a popular language for Android development. So it only makes sense that we would shift our Android development at Meta to Kotlin as we work to make our development workflows more efficient. Meta’s Android repository is very large and reaches across our family of apps and technologies, including Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, Portal, and the Quest. Shifting away from Java, which we currently use for Android development, and over to Kotlin is not a trivial task.

**Futuristic CSS**  
https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2022/10/futuristic-css/  
In this article, Sacha Greif tries to anticipate future CSS trends and takes a look at some far-fetched and futuristic CSS features that might one day make their way to the browser. Releated: [Is There Too Much CSS Now?](https://css-tricks.com/is-there-too-much-css-now/).  

**How to maintain engineering velocity as you scale**  
https://www.ycombinator.com/blog/how-to-maintain-engineering-velocity-as-you-scale/  
Faire’s engineering team grew from five to over 100 engineers in three years. Throughout this growth, we were able to sustain our pace of engineering execution by adhering to four important elements: Hiring the best engineers; Building solid long-term foundations from day one; Tracking metrics to guide decision-making; Keeping teams small and independent.

**The science of motivation: how to get and stay motivated**  
https://nesslabs.com/science-of-motivation  
When your motivation vanishes, what can you do to get it back? Many of us will buy an inspirational book or watch motivational videos, thinking this will help us get our mojo back. But these tricks are unlikely to be successful. In reality, motivation only starts to build again once we have taken the first steps and gained some momentum in our task. In the words of Lao Tzu: “The journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.” Motivation is all about getting started and consistently taking action, making sure we get back on track when we fall off the bandwagon.

**Web 应用架构的下一个转变**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/34wjd63o_zpEocQpIvWHSw  
Web 技术大概 25 年前开始萌芽，HTTP、HTML、CSS 和 JS 都是在九十年代中期首次被标准化的。直到如今，Web 演变成一个无处不在的应用平台。随着 Web 的发展，Web 应用程序的开发架构也在不断发展。现在有许多用于构建 Web 应用程序的核心架构，目前最流行的是单页应用 (SPA)，但我们正在逐渐过渡到一种新的改进架构来构建 Web 应用程序。

**A beginner’s guide to Chrome tracing**  
https://nolanlawson.com/2022/10/26/a-beginners-guide-to-chrome-tracing/  
Chrome tracing (aka Chromium tracing) lets you record a performance trace that captures low-level details of what the browser is doing. It’s mostly used by Chromium engineers themselves, but it can also be helpful for web developers when a DevTools trace is not enough. This post is a short guide on how to use this tool, from a web developer’s point of view. I’m not going to cover everything – just the bare minimum to get up and running.

**Do you really understand CSS radial-gradients?**  
https://patrickbrosset.com/articles/2022-10-24-do-you-really-understand-CSS-radial-gradients/  
Seven years ago, I taught myself all about CSS linear gradients and, ever since, I've been meaning to learn more about how radial gradients worked as well. It took me a long time to find an excuse to dig deeper into the logic behind it but I'm very thankful I did. To learn how to use the radial-gradient CSS function, I attempted to draw a pair or eyes, only with CSS, just one element par eye, and only using radial gradients. Releated: [Highly Customizable Background Gradients](https://cloudfour.com/thinks/highly-customizable-background-gradients/).  

**Make use of `use` in React – a new hook is coming**

The team behind React has unveiled a new hook called `use`. This inconspicuous creation could forever change the way we get data into our applications.

**Building software to last forever**  
https://herman.bearblog.dev/building-software-to-last-forever/  
This is a great question, and one I have put a lot of thought into, even going so far as to put "Built to last forever" on the landing page. While drafting a lengthly reply I realised that I'd never articulated the design philosophy of Bear to anyone bar friends. So, without further ado, here are the choices I made in designing and building Bear with regards to longevity.

**Linux: What can you epoll?**  
https://darkcoding.net/software/linux-what-can-you-epoll/  
At the start of this year I argued that epoll is the API that powers the modern Internet, but what can you actually do with epoll? Once we structure our application around an epoll event loop or use an async engine such as Go or Rust’s tokio, it becomes really useful to integrate everything else into that event loop.

**Everything dies, including information**

Digitization can help stem the tide of entropy, but it won’t stop it.

为什么微信越来越臃肿了？在过去十一年来，微信是如何一步一步成为一个超级 APP 的？为了了解背后的发展故事，我作了此文加以梳理。研究中国最大的社交软件的发展史，其实也是研究过去十几年来简中移动互联网的变迁过程。同时我也想解答一个徘徊在脑海许久的疑问：在摇滚精神和改革开放理念下成长的一代人、简中世界互联网的掌门人、作为新中国历史以来最成功的阶级上升案例，是如何一步一步从勇者变成恶龙的？
