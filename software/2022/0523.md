**对少即是多的误解**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/tZ_vBlh71Di0KrLQ2LYMhA  
我们过度强调「Don't make me think」，会让用户丧失掉释放自己潜力的机会。一如小孩子自行车的辅助轮，不能提供完美的平衡，也总是临时性的，但是这个过程能让骑车的孩子自己释放出来找到平衡的能力，这便是「这样就好」的设计哲学 —— 不去过度地设计。少即是多，并不仅仅是一句口号或者一个技巧，而是一种设计哲学，一种尊重人本身的创造性，而甘愿将自己作为容器的哲学 —— 在这背后是对经济增长模式，人类与环境的关系，人类本身的幸福，人类自己的能动性的思考。

**Stripe: Migrating millions of lines of code to TypeScript**  
https://stripe.com/blog/migrating-to-typescript  
On Sunday March 6, we migrated Stripe’s largest JavaScript codebase (powering the Stripe Dashboard) from Flow to TypeScript. In a single pull request, we converted more than 3.7 million lines of code. The next day, hundreds of engineers came in to start writing TypeScript for their projects.

**The balance has shifted away from SPAs**  
https://nolanlawson.com/2022/05/21/the-balance-has-shifted-away-from-spas/  
https://nolanlawson.com/2022/05/25/more-thoughts-on-spas/  
There’s a feeling in the air. A zeitgeist. SPAs are no longer the cool kids they once were 10 years ago. Hip new frameworks like Astro, Qwik, and Elder.js are touting their MPA capabilities with “0kB JavaScript by default.” Blog posts are making the rounds listing all the challenges with SPAs: history, focus management, scroll restoration, Cmd/Ctrl-click, memory leaks, etc. Gleeful potshots are being taken against SPAs.

**Github: Render mathematical expressions in Markdown**  
https://github.blog/changelog/2022-05-19-render-mathematical-expressions-in-markdown/  
https://github.blog/2022-05-19-math-support-in-markdown/  
You can now use LaTeX style syntax to render math expressions within Markdown inline (using $ delimiters) or in blocks (using $$ delimiters).  

**The future of personal computing software**  
https://alexanderobenauer.com/weekly/20220521/  
We’ve explored lots of possible features for the OS of the future. But how should systems of the future reify their functionality? How should they make their primitives available to users? Who has the ability to evolve these systems long into the future? This week’s lab note considers how flexible systems could work for users of all levels of computer literacy: [LN 028: Designing systems for computer literacy and evolvability](https://alexanderobenauer.com/labnotes/028/)  

**Why You Should Care About Software Architecture**  
https://www.infoq.com/articles/care-about-architecture/  
Many software developers are distrustful of architecture practices. They associate these practices with rigid and overbearing processes, and with significant upfront planning and design. As a result, they believe that if they follow those practices, it may take them a long time to finally deliver something that may not even be what the customer wanted.

**Why are so few funded startups using serverless?**  
https://serverlessfirst.com/emails/why-are-so-few-funded-startups-using-serverless/  
A few days ago I asked this question on Twitter: The value prop for startups to use serverless is very strong IMO, yet it seems that most still aren’t using it. I heard stat from a recent large accelerator cohort that only a small % were meaningfully using serverless. Why do you think adoption in funded startups is so slow? I got a load of really interested replies, of which I’m sharing a curated list below.

**Fly.io: the Reclaimer of Heroku's Magic**  
https://christine.website/blog/fly.io-heroku-replacement  
Heroku was catalytic to my career.  However, I can confidently say that fly.io seems like a viable inheritor of the mantle of responsibility that Heroku has left into the hands of the cloud. fly.io is a Platform-as-a-Service that hosts your applications on top of physical dedicated servers run all over the world instead of being a reseller of AWS. This allows them to get your app running in multiple regions for a lot less than it would cost to run it on Heroku. They also use anycasting to allow your app to use the same IP address globally. The internet itself will load balance users to the nearest instance using BGP as the load balancing substrate.

**The web3 world computer is at a 1970 level of development**  
https://interconnected.org/home/2022/05/20/fermi  
If the web3 world computer has only just reached 1970 then, first, don’t expect too much. There’s real utility to be found but in very prescribed use cases. But also, second, there are wild and unrecognisable transformations to come. There is room for imagination and invention.

**Codebases as communication**  
https://buttondown.email/hillelwayne/archive/codebases-as-communication/  
Conventionally we communicate programming ideas with talks, papers, and blog posts. But we can also communicate ideas with entire codebases. If someone finds a security exploit, she’ll sometimes publish a proof of concept to prove the exploit isn’t just theoretical.

**Rust: A Critical Retrospective**  
https://www.bunniestudios.com/blog/?p=6375  
Since I was unable to travel for a couple of years during the pandemic, I decided to take my new-found time and really lean into Rust. After writing over 100k lines of Rust code, I think I am starting to get a feel for the language and like every cranky engineer I have developed opinions and because this is the Internet I’m going to share them.

**Web Applications 101**  
https://www.robinwieruch.de/web-applications/  
A website doesn't equal a website these days. A website ranges from a marketing website for a product to a full-blown social media platform. As someone new to web development, it's not easy to grasp the landscape: What starts out as a traditional website with HTML and CSS, which is returned from a web server, turns into a way more difficult full-stack application with sophisticated client-server communication and state management. If you are already into learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, without knowing about the fundamentals of websites and web applications, this comprehensive guide is for you.

**I spent 2 years launching tiny projects**  
https://tinyprojects.dev/posts/i_spent_two_years_launching_tiny_projects  
Two years ago, frustrated with a long list of unfulfilled project ideas in my phone notes, I decided to start trying one idea each week in its tiniest form. I never kept to a weekly schedule, but I've kept plodding along since then and launched 8 things. Each morning I sit down with a coffee and bash out some project code. It's a hobby I love, and one that's starting to generate some decent passive income now. In this post I want to update you on everything I've launched, and share what I've learnt about building lots of these tiny internet projects.

"天不言自高，地不言自厚，以万物为参照，可洞观一己之不足。"正是这种"深藏不露"，使低调拥有了特殊的魅力！给人希望，赐人清凉。
