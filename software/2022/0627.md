**What willwould a Chromium-only Web look like**  
https://www.mnot.net/blog/2022/06/22/chromium-only  
So my ears perked up when I recently heard from a well-placed contact that “many in the Chromium community are arguing for a Chromium-only Web.” While the Chrome team (and friends) have long railed against what they perceive as other browsers’ plodding implementation of cutting-edge extensions to the Web, it’s a pretty big leap to advocate for a Web with only one browser engine. Releated: [GitHub - How we think about browsers](https://github.blog/2022-06-10-how-we-think-about-browsers/), [Where is Copilot Taking Us?](https://redmonk.com/sogrady/2022/06/23/copilot/).

**Why I Like Hexagonal Architecture**  
https://alexkondov.com/why-i-favor-hexagonal-architecture/  
I haven’t written that much clean code in the last nine years. I’ve created features and entire products on my own. But looking at my code I didn’t get the satisfaction that an artist feels when they’re admiring their work. I wasn’t writing the clean code you read about in books. I didn’t utilize design patterns. I didn’t think about architecture, structure and readability. My only concern was whether it produced the desired output on the client’s screen. When I think about it this was a normal consequence of the environment I was working in.

**GitHub Copilot is generally available to all developers**  
https://github.blog/2022-06-21-github-copilot-is-generally-available-to-all-developers/  
We’re making GitHub Copilot, an AI pair programmer that suggests code in your editor, generally available to all developers for $10 USD/month or $100 USD/year. It will also be free to use for verified students and maintainers of popular open source projects.

**Companies Using RFCs or Design Docs and Examples of These**  
https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/rfcs-and-design-docs/  
This article collects some openly available RFC templates and examples, and a list of companies that use such a process. I’d encourage to use these examples for inspiration. Take parts that resonate with you, experiment with them and modify them to your needs.

**Why products should be “slick”, not just viable**  
https://herman.bearblog.dev/mvp-vs-slc/  
I hate the term MVP. Over the past decade, it’s been overused and misunderstood to the point where something labeled as an MVP is automatically assumed to be pretty shit. Most MVPs are unfortunately too M to be V, and the culture of “ship it while you’re embarrassed by it” tends to lead to products providing users with an embarrassingly bad experience. The problem is that your users hate MVPs. Releated: [Products and People](https://www.svpg.com/products-and-people/).

**How We Built Hydrogen: A React Framework for Building Custom Storefronts**  
https://shopify.engineering/how-we-built-hydrogen  
We’ve been building Hydrogen, a React framework for building custom storefronts on Shopify, for more than a year. We invested in cutting-edge new technology, like React Server Components, to ensure building on the Shopify platform is a terrific experience for developers. Here’s a look behind the scenes at how we did it, what we learned from making big bets, and what it was like building a new framework from the ground up on experimental technology.

Filmed in locations throughout Europe and the US, it features Svelte’s creator Rich Harris and members from the core community who contributed to making Svelte what it is today.  

**Notes on WebAssembly**  
http://neugierig.org/software/blog/2022/06/wasm-notes.html  
One of the things that attracted me to work at Figma was a chance to learn about and work with WebAssembly. It turns out Figma is a pretty good environment for this. Figma is a combination of "native to the web" — a lot of the app written in the ordinary React/TypeScript stack — while also using a surprising quantity of low-level C++ code. Figma documents as edited in your browser are rendered using GPU shaders managed by a C++ scene graph, which you'd probably only ever notice if you thought about how smooth zooming is! This post goes into it a bit. Releated: [The State of WebAssembly 2022](https://blog.scottlogic.com/2022/06/20/state-of-wasm-2022.html).  

**反思软件开发：生存策略**  
https://ourai.ws/posts/survival-in-software-team/  
很多文章从正面、积极的方向去谈论前端工程师的职业发展与成长，就像人类社会总是倾向于去宣扬好的、正能量的事情，让人们吸上名为「安逸」、「快乐」的奶嘴儿，从而忘记自己身边危机四伏。本文试着从反面、消极的方向去探讨前端工程师在职业发展与成长中可能面临的问题、困境与矛盾，试图唤醒大家的危机意识。我并未像文章标题一样给出「生存策略」，而是指出「生存问题」希望大家去针对性地寻找适合自己的「生存策略」。

**软件方法 - 建模带来的竞争优势**  
http://www.umlchina.com/book/softmeth.html  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/vC5s365f2sAdjNIKeROQ8Q  
改革开放初期，中国出现了许多农民企业家，他们不用讲管理，也不用讲方法，只要胆子大一点，就能获得成功，因为当时的市场几乎空白，竞争非常少。农民企业家的思路很简单：人人都要吃饭，所以开饭馆能够赚钱。现在这样的思路已经行不通了。市场竞争已经足够激烈，十家新开张的饭馆恐怕只有一家能撑下来，所以农民企业家已经很少见（连农民都越来越少了）。软件业也一样，最开始的时候，会编程就了不得，思路也很简单：每个公司都要做财务，所以开发财务软件能赚钱。现在呢？我们想到一个“点子”，可能有上千人同时想到了；我们要做一个系统，可能发现市场上已经有许多类似的系统。你卖高价，他就卖低价，你卖低价，他就干脆免费。机会驱动、粗放经营的时代已经远去，为了在激烈的竞争中获得优势，软件开发组织需要从细节上提升技能。本书聚焦于两方面的技能：需求和设计。

**Why we need a flowchart editor that doesn't give you carpal tunnel**  
https://www.scottantipa.com/why-knotend  
This is a post about why I'm making [knotend](https://www.knotend.com/), a flowchart editor designed for speed, and why we need to get away from mouse-based flowchart editors. Related: [Markwhen: Markdown for Timelines](https://markwhen.com/).  

**Unlocking the Metaverse: New Opportunities in Games Infrastructure**  
https://future.com/metaverse-infrastructure-technology-games/  
Why game creators? No other industry has as much experience building massive online worlds, in which hundreds of thousands (and sometimes tens of millions!) of online participants engage with each other—often simultaneously. Already, modern games are about much more than just “play” – they’re just as much about “trade,” “craft,” “stream,” or “buy.” The metaverse adds yet more verbs—think “work” or “love”—to that list. And just as microservices and cloud computing unlocked a wave of innovation in the tech industry, I believe the next generation of game technologies will usher in a new generation of innovation and creativity in gaming.

**When is OOP not that great?**  
https://robotlolita.me/diary/2022/06/when-is-oop-not-great/  
As you might know, I really like object-oriented programming. I also have designed and implemented several object-oriented languages. Which, in turn, means that I’ve seen plenty of the not-so-great sides of the idea, both in the theory underlying it and in actual language implementations. So let me rant a little bit about the things that have not brought me that much joy.

**The Future of Information Work**  
https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2022/7/262073-the-future-of-information-work/fulltext  
The state of information and knowledge work is evolving. Many U.S. companies implemented firmwide remote work for nearly two years and now a new transition—one to hybrid work—has started. These transitions create opportunities to revisit existing norms, which are otherwise extremely difficult to break away from, and establish new norms that make the future of work better for everyone. They also create opportunities to revisit our tools and technologies to the benefit of work and workers alike. Researchers should try to shape this future to be one in which as many people as possible enjoy as many of the benefits of remote, hybrid, and in-office work, with as few of the drawbacks, as possible.

**Microsoft’s framework for building AI systems responsibly**  
https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2022/06/21/microsofts-framework-for-building-ai-systems-responsibly/  
Today we are sharing publicly Microsoft’s Responsible AI Standard, a framework to guide how we build AI systems. It is an important step in our journey to develop better, more trustworthy AI. We are releasing our latest Responsible AI Standard to share what we have learned, invite feedback from others, and contribute to the discussion about building better norms and practices around AI.

**writing one sentence per line**  
https://sive.rs/1s  
My advice to anyone who writes: Try writing one sentence per line. I’ve been doing it for twenty years, and it improved my writing more than anything else. New sentence? Hit [Enter]. New line. Not publishing one sentence per line, no. Write like this for your eyes only. HTML or Markdown combine separate lines into one paragraph. Why is it so useful?

**苹果传奇设计团队解散内幕**

https://www.fastcompany.com/90741719/inside-the-dissolution-of-apples-legacy-design-team  
2019年，这个被称为“最像乔布斯的人”，放弃苹果首席设计师位置，挥别自己供职27年的老东家，另立门户。这几乎是苹果设计团队发生的最大人事震动。要知道，乔纳森是Mac、iPod、iPhone、Apple Watch等一系列苹果产品的打造者和设计师，曾被视为乔布斯的接班人、一度声望高过库克。当时，乔纳森对自己离职的解释为“个人新追求”。如今，随着一本名为《After Steve》的书籍出版，更为深层的原因被曝光在大众视野中——理念不合。

**少数派靠什么赚钱，赚到钱了吗？**

我们想象中最理想的赚钱方式，当然是内容付费，我们给作者发稿酬，用户为他认可的内容付钱，逻辑很简单，但实操非常难，十年了，有付费习 惯的用户依然是小众群体，作者分享的，也不一定是所有用户想看的，触达目标用户的成本也越来越高。

**漫谈去中心化组织706和数字游民现状**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/G1KcKfWoO7AcYplRr5lXYA  
当前数字游民领域也确实存在很多问题，目前在国内，价值观匹配的难度高于技能匹配。数字游民是一种生活方式，也是一种取舍，肯定不是适用于所有人。但是年轻人如果能看到更多选项，并愿意去尝试非标准答案，也是很好的。一生很长，可以允许我们试错；一生也很短，在一成不变中麻木了对时间的感知，这一生也就过去了。
