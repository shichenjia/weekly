**A career ending mistake**  
https://bitfieldconsulting.com/golang/career  
By “the end”, I don't necessarily mean picking your retirement date. What we're really talking about is the aim or goal of your career. Where will you be when you realise that this is where you've always wanted to be? If you love what you're doing now and don't ever want to change jobs, great: you've reached the end of your career, even if it plays out over many decades. If you don't love it, and that's much more likely, then it's worth asking what would make you feel that way, and when it's going to happen. So, where do you want to end up? And is that where you're currently heading? If not, what should you do about it?

**Why Flutter is the most popular cross-platform mobile SDK**  
https://stackoverflow.blog/2022/02/21/why-flutter-is-the-most-popular-cross-platform-mobile-sdk/  
Running a development team for each mobile platform sucks up resources from other work. Flutter is the most popular way for one development team to build on all platforms.

**Vercel, Netlify, and the New Era of 'Serverless PaaS'**  
https://www.infoworld.com/article/3650751/vercel-netlify-and-the-new-era-of-serverless-paas.html  
An emerging set of vendors is trying to simplify the job of web development, again. Is this the next generation of platform as a service, or something completely different? Releated: [Is Serverless Just a Stopover for Event-Driven Architecture?](https://thenewstack.io/is-serverless-just-a-stopover-for-event-driven-architecture/).  

**Server-Sent Events, WebSockets, and HTTP**  
https://www.mnot.net/blog/2022/02/20/websockets  
What's the best way to do pub/sub on the Web? The orange site is currently [discussing](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30312897) an [article about Server-Sent Events](https://germano.dev/sse-websockets/), especially as compared with WebSockets (and the emerging WebTransport). Both the article and discussion are well-informed, but I think they miss out on one aspect that has fairly deep implications.

**Testing Pipeline 101 For Frontend Testing**  
https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2022/02/testing-pipeline-101-frontend-testing/  
Automated testing can give you much confidence in merging your changes, especially in extensive refactoring or working with your teammates. As a result, you might have thought about including testing as part of your build routine to get the most value out of it. Don’t know where to start? Let’s implement your testing pipeline together from scratch.

**Server Side Rendering at Scale**  
https://engineeringblog.yelp.com/2022/02/server-side-rendering-at-scale.html  
At Yelp, we use Server Side Rendering (SSR) to improve the performance of our React-based frontend pages. After a string of production incidents in early 2021, we realized our existing SSR system was failing to scale as we migrated more pages from Python-based templates to React. Throughout the rest of the year, we worked to re-architect our SSR system in a way that increased stability, reduced costs, and improved observability for feature teams.

**What are wrapper objects for primitive values?**  
https://2ality.com/2022/02/wrapper-objects.html  
Each of the primitive types boolean, number, bigint, string and symbol has an associated wrapper class (Boolean, Number, BigInt, String, Symbol). In this blog post, we examine what these classes are good for.

**Security of React Native libraries: the bad, the worse and the ugly**  
https://www.cossacklabs.com/blog/react-native-libraries-security/  
Unfortunately, React Native ecosystem brings the JavaScript dependency hell into the mobile application world, and we often see issues in third party libraries that drastically affect the security of the main application, and not in a particularly good way. But trust no word of a stranger, let’s take a look together!

**Builder A Greener Web by Michelle Barker**  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdiSM9wLPAM  
As part of a series of talks entitled IN COMMISSION TO NO EMISSIONS, around resources, performance and the environment, Michelle Baker had recently written a few posts that caught our attention.

**The Fastest GIF Does Not Exist**  
https://www.biphelps.com/blog/The-Fastest-GIF-Does-Not-Exist  
If you're here because you want to fix your GIF and want the quick answer, the solution is: set your frame delay to 20ms instead of 10ms. If you want to learn a bit more about GIFs, exactly why this edge case happens, and some thoughts on how to improve things, keep reading!

**2021 highlight: Decoding brain activity to new cognitive paradigms**  
http://gael-varoquaux.info/science/2021-highlight-decoding-brain-activity-to-new-cognitive-paradigms.html  
Decoding models can help isolating which mental processes are implied by the activation of given brain structures. But to support a broad conclusion, they must be trained on many studies, a difficult problem given the unclear relations between tasks of different studies. We contributed a method that infers these links from the data. Their validity is established by generalization to new tasks. Some cognitive neuroscientists prefer qualitative consolidation of knowledge, but such approach is hard to put to the test.

**Rebuilding Payment Orchestration at Airbnb**  
https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/rebuilding-payment-orchestration-at-airbnb-341d194a781b  
How we maintained reliable money movement while migrating Airbnb’s payment orchestration system from the legacy monolithic application to a service-oriented architecture

**How we optimized Python API server code 100x**  
https://blog.sentry.io/2022/02/25/how-we-optimized-python-api-server-code-100x  
This post is about our experience in Python code optimizations when whatever you do is not fast enough. I personally had much fun undertaking the challenges and squeezing API response times under one second. So much fun, in fact, that we’ve got enough notes for a series of blog posts.

**Internals of Go's new fuzzing system**  
https://jayconrod.com/posts/123/internals-of-go-s-new-fuzzing-system  
Fuzzing is a testing technique where the testing infrastructure calls your code with randomly generated inputs to check that it produces correct results or reasonable errors. Fuzz testing complements unit testing, where you test that your code produces the correct outputs, given a static set of inputs. Unit testing is limited in that you only really test with expected inputs; fuzz testing is great at discovering unexpected inputs that expose weird behavior. A good fuzzing system also instruments the code being tested so it can efficiently generate inputs that expand code coverage.

**Vim 9 will be dedicated to Sven Guckes**  
https://groups.google.com/g/vim_announce/c/MJBKVd-xrEE/m/joVNaDgAAgAJ?pli=1  
Sven (when he was still a student at the Free University of Berlin) was very active in the Vim development team in the Nineties. He was the one who set up the vim.org domain. Later on he had the idea of "What is Vim?", an explanation of Vim in six kilobytes, and helped with some versions of Vimtutor.
