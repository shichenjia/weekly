**Why We Will Never Have Enough Software Developers**  
https://whoisnnamdi.com/never-enough-developers/  
To conclude, I emphasize: highly skilled people prefer highly stable careers in the long-run. This lets their relative ability and human capital advantage compound over time. Rapid deterioration of skills continuously levels the playing field, preventing the best from separating themselves from the pack. In such a situation, it makes more sense to quit the race early than get caught in the pile up. Related:

**Tauri 1.0 - Electron Alternative Powered by Rust**  
https://tauri.app/v1/guides/  
Tauri is a toolkit that helps developers make applications for the major desktop platforms - using virtually any frontend framework in existence. The core is built with Rust, and the CLI leverages Node.js making Tauri a genuinely polyglot approach to creating and maintaining great apps.

**Introducing ProbeLab**  
https://blog.ipfs.io/2022-06-15-probelab/  
ProbeLab is an effort to apply solid scientific measurement methodologies to benchmark and optimize network protocols that operate in decentralized P2P environments. ProbeLab was born out of the need for developing a deeper understanding of how permissionless, decentralized networks can be made more performant and comparable to their centralized counterparts. ProbeLab’s mission is summarized in the following quote: “You can’t improve what you don’t measure, and you should measure what (you think) you’ve just improved.”

**Sponsoring dependencies: The next step in open source sustainability**  
https://humanwhocodes.com/blog/2022/06/sponsoring-dependencies-open-source-sustainability/  
We are at a point in open source development where it's become clear that not all projects have the same opportunity to receive funding and maintainers are the key to fixing this.

**Notes on maintaining an internal React component library**  
https://www.gabe.pizza/notes-on-component-libraries/  
This document is a collection of my thoughts on maintaining a component library as part of an existing design system used by a large number of frontend applications. I don’t particularly care much for visual design—though I seem effective at implementing it—and am more interested in the software engineering and social challenges of building a large-scale component library.

**WebGL 实战之绘制圆角矩形**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/4uUaFMc6uUOPXE-8cveTFg  
随着业务发展需要，订阅号消息流中的部分卡片现已完成动态化改造，卡片 UI 渲染的工作由基于 WebGL 实现的渲染器完成。本篇文章将介绍底层的实现原理，核心就是用 WebGL 实现圆角矩形的绘制，基于圆角矩形我们就可以像拼图一般完成整个卡片的绘制。

**端智能在大众点评搜索重排序的应用实践**  
https://tech.meituan.com/2022/06/16/edge-search-rerank.html  
搜索是大众点评 App 连接用户与商家的重要渠道，越来越多的用户在不同场景下都会通过搜索来获取自己想要的服务。理解用户的搜索意图，将用户最想要结果排在靠前的位置，是搜索引擎最核心的步骤。为了进一步优化搜索个性化的排序能力，提升用户体验，搜索技术中心进行了在端上部署深度个性化模型的探索实践。本文主要介绍了端智能重排在大众点评 App 上的实践经验，文章主要分为以下三个部分：第一部分主要分析端智能重排要解决的问题和整体流程；第二部分会介绍端上重排序算法部分的探索实践过程；第三部分将介绍端上重排系统的架构设计以及部署优化，最后是总结与展望。

**AbortController is your friend**  
https://whistlr.info/2022/abortcontroller-is-your-friend/  
One of my favorite new features of JS is the humble AbortController, and its AbortSignal. It enables some new development patterns, which I'll cover below, but first: the canonical demo.

**Using web streams on Node.js**  
https://2ality.com/2022/06/web-streams-nodejs.html  
Streams are mechanisms for reading and writing data – e.g. from and to files. JavaScript has the cross-platform standard “web streams”. We explore it on Node.js, but most of what we learn also applies to web browsers and Deno.

**The many definitions of Server-Side Rendering**  
https://www.zachleat.com/web/ssr-overloaded/  
Now folks that spend their time in the wonderful world of frameworks have likely encountered the term “Server-Side Rendering” (often abbreviated as SSR). What they might not be familiar with is that SSR is defined differently in Component and Application framework contexts.

**Scaling GraphQL with Redis Consumer Groups**  
https://www.parabol.co/blog/scaling-graphql-with-redis-consumer-groups/  
We’ve just hit over 200,000 users at Parabol. With all this extra traffic, we noticed response time latency starting to increase, which makes sense because until recently we only used a single NodeJS server!  While investigating, we realized the bottleneck wasn’t with our highly efficient custom uWebSockets server (we still only use 1 of those). Instead, the latency was coming from all the GraphQL requests.

**Helping migrate React Native libraries to the New Architecture**  
https://reactnative.dev/blog/2022/06/16/resources-migrating-your-react-native-library-to-the-new-architecture  
We are working on improving the resources supporting the React Native New Architecture. We have already released a repository to help migrate your app (RNNewArchitectureApp) and one for your libraries (RNNewArchitectureLibraries). We are also revamping the New Architecture guide on the Website and we created a GitHub Working Group to answer questions related to the New Architecture.

**Why We’re Sticking with Ruby on Rails at GitLab**  
https://thenewstack.io/why-were-sticking-with-ruby-on-rails-at-gitlab/  
When David Heinemeier Hansson created Ruby on Rails (interview), he was guided by his experience with both PHP and Java. On the one hand, he didn’t like the way the verbosity and rigidness of Java made Java web frameworks complex and difficult to use, but he appreciated their structural integrity. On the other hand, he loved the initial approachability of PHP but was less fond of the quagmires that such projects tended to turn into.

**AI-Written Critiques Help Humans Notice Flaws**  
https://openai.com/blog/critiques/  
We trained “critique-writing” models to describe flaws in summaries. Human evaluators find flaws in summaries much more often when shown our model’s critiques. Larger models are better at self-critiquing, with scale improving critique-writing more than summary-writing. This shows promise for using AI systems to assist human supervision of AI systems on difficult tasks.

**Construction is Life**  
https://kk.org/thetechnium/construction-is-life/  
So now when I encounter cranes shooting up from a street, I feel reassured that this place is alive and in good health. When I see a neighborhood with contractor trucks parked along the street, doing remodels, and repairs, I think, yes, this feels good. Construction is life.

**Alien Intelligence and the Concept of Technology**  
https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2022/06/alien-intelligence-and-the-concept-of-technology/  
For a long time it’s been a mystery why we’ve never detected alien intelligence out there in the cosmos. But actually I think there’s no lack of “alien intelligence”; indeed it’s all around us. But the point is that it really is alien. At an abstract computational level it’s like our intelligence. But in its details it’s not aligned with our intelligence. Abstractly it’s intelligence, but it’s not human-like intelligence. It’s alien intelligence.

**Lessons on creativity from Everything, Everywhere, All at Once**  
https://uxdesign.cc/lessons-on-creativity-from-everything-everywhere-all-at-once-37e87637067f  
Here, creativity is on full display. This movie was refreshingly original, and I immediately wanted to know more about their process. As I immersed myself in every Q&A session and interview I could find, I was struck by the ways that their process overlapped with what The Beatles did. These are the techniques used by the best of the best, and I believe they can be useful not only to musicians and filmmakers, but when doing creative work of all kinds. Here’s what I found.

**被裹挟的豆瓣的一生**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/SWARJUOWHYCjBW1Vw4HWXA  
豆瓣这篇文章，前前后后写了将近一个月。因为豆瓣是身上存在太多争议：豆瓣到底是失败的，还是成功的？豆瓣是美好的社区乌托邦，还是不负责任的社区治理者？……本文前半部分是纵向梳理，解读豆瓣在不同阶段的成败得失。后半部分是横向解剖，从底层架构上去分析，为什么豆瓣远远无法成为一个理想的大社区。作为多年的互联网产品从业者，作为理想社区的做梦者，希望用这篇文章，陪你读懂豆瓣兴衰沉浮的来龙去脉。

**这个身价1000亿美金的男人，为什么“失踪”了？**  
https://new.qq.com/omn/20220613/20220613A047V200.html  
行踪不定的佩奇偶尔也会出现在一些由科学家组织的小型沙龙上，他有时会向别人提供商业化的建议，有时会蹲在一旁，就某个技术与人聊上很久。没有人意识到他是谷歌的创始人，硅谷之外的人认不出他，硅谷的人对他熟视无睹。佩奇坐岛观海的场景也似一则隐喻。古代地中海地区山多地少，地无余粮，无法供养职业军人去占领别的城邦，所以很难构建东方大一统的农业帝国，就连后来的古罗马也是建立在地方自治之上的。比如古希腊人的生存依赖跨海贸易，并以契约为基础，经商和构建城邦国家，不太依靠武力汲取财富。面朝茫茫大海，这是西方科技创新的心理源头，东方的古代统治者则是面朝芸芸众生，前者求变，敢于冒险；后者求稳，追求收益率。

**毛泽东：实事求是的三重境界**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/xebOOg6cjg0uc-5_WRlLjQ  
一切从实际出发，而不是纸上谈兵，空讲理论，但这实际是只是实事求是的第二重境界。所谓“实事求是“，首先就是不能教条主义，认死理。我之所以花这么多时间来讲故事，是因为很多人连这第一重都没有突破。该灵活的时候死守原则，该原则的时候偏偏随意变通。毛泽东所仰仗的“秘术“，实际上，就是“实事求是”的第三重境界：用苦心求得的规律，来指导现实的实践。实事求是的原理是什么？第一层，不僵化，要让行动符合逻辑。第二层，不空谈，要让理论结合实际。第三层，掌握历史的主动，要让规律指导实践。
