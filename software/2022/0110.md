2022 年已经到来，我们是时候反思 Web 开发中的种种过时软件、炒作歪曲和荒谬趋势了。把握这一年，我们也该重新专注于性能与技术运用，把手段和目的重新统一起来。当然，我不是劝大家用汇编或者 C 语言搞 Web 开发，但关于 JavaScript、Ruby on Rails、Python、Django 以及 PHP 框架的疯狂观点也该消停一下了。另附：[Have Single-Page Apps Ruined the Web? | Transitional Apps with Rich Harris, NYTimes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=860d8usGC0o)。

The GitHub Security Lab’s CodeQL bounty program fuels GitHub Advanced Security (GHAS) with CodeQL queries written by the open source community. In this blog post, I’ll discuss how these queries solve these pain points and make GHAS security alerts more effective for developers and their teams.

**web3 is Centralized**  
https://blog.wesleyac.com/posts/web3-centralized  
The funny thing is, web3, as it exists today and appears to be building towards, is actually more centralized than the web it seeks to replace. Releated:

**The Advantages of Text-Based Information Versus Videos, Audio or Images**  
https://karl-voit.at/2022/01/08/text-vs-video-audio-images/  
After I have introduced myself and my research on tagstore where I was using user-generated tags to support filing and retrieving arbitrary files on the local file system, she explained that she doesn't see any future in that research. To my surprise, she argued that the future is not text-based. She wants to shift her focus on video-based information where she thinks that this will be much more relevant for the people. According to her, text is getting less important while video is getting more and more important. This is why I do think that we should think about the importance of information locked into video, audio and image content.

**How to bring DevOps to the database with GitLab and Liquibase**  
https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2022/01/05/how-to-bring-devops-to-the-database-with-gitlab-and-liquibase/  
The GitLab DevOps platform enables database management teams to leverage CI/CD to track, manage, and deploy database changes, along with application development and automation and infrastructure as code. Database change management tools have become more advanced in recent years, supporting easier collaboration and communication, which are the keys to successful DevOps. In this blog post, I’ll take you through a tutorial using Liquibase, a tool that integrates seamlessly into the GitLab DevOps platform so your teams can deliver database code changes as fast as application code changes (without compromising on quality and security).

**Capturing Solution Design Details In Serverless Developments — Part II**  
https://medium.com/lego-engineering/capturing-solution-design-details-in-serverless-developments-part-ii-3d2e51b5be66  
In a fast-paced agile environment, teams evolve, and engineers move around. Due to this, the domain and design knowledge fade from them. Storing the traces of what they went through, how they conceptualized the solution is vital. True, the source code repository plays its part, but it doesn’t explain the design unless captured and kept for everyone to understand. This article introduces a documentation template to collate and keep the design details in one place.

**Managing Knowledge with the Zettelkasten Method**
https://blog.scottlogic.com/2022/01/04/managing-knowledge-zettelkasten.html
There is a lot of information available to us - more than ever before. Thousands of books and scientific papers are being published each day, along with millions of websites and hours upon hours of video resources. There are so many tools, frameworks and packages available for a developer to use. How do you keep track of it all and make use of it effectively? It’s impossible for one person to make good use of this much information without help or tools.

**小色彩，大故事**  
https://sspai.com/post/70689  
每年 12 月潘通公司都会公布新一年的年度代表色，预测新一年的趋势。从 2000 年的年度代表色 CERULEAN BLUE 15-4020 开始，到 2021 年的 ultimate gray，潘通已经公布了 24 种年度代表色，加上今年公布的已经有 25 种之多。这么多年一路走下来，潘通的年度代表色已经成为一种传统。而回顾刚刚发布的 Very Peri，机灵、愉悦、充满活力与激发勇气，或许这是代表着疫情三年之时我们对未来的更美好的展望。

**和飞书林婵闭门茶聊的 1.5 个小时**

先进的生产力工具、而非成熟的制度，才是对企业组织方式的有效升级。古典互联网过去的十年，人们以为不会再出现什么让人惊艳的工具类产品。但，它们还是出现了。突然爆发的新冠疫情，让协作类产品顺时代而「红」。Notion 在过去一年市值超过 100 亿美金，Slack 被 Salesforce 收购；而国内的飞书，一款极大地展示字节跳动产品思想的「作品」，甚至在问世 3 年多的时间内，成为了先进组织和传统互联网公司的分水岭。 

**鬼脚七 - 产品经理的十大顶级错误**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/q2or5G8f9CN6eMFWayUJCg  
产品经理需要创造产品。上帝也是个产品经理，他创造了人这个产品。做一个成功的产品非常难，除了需要有资源、时机等问题以外，更大因素在产品经理。好的产品经理能协调资源，能把握时机。但产品经理自己也经常犯错误。最近翻看了之前的记录，发现资深产品专家Marty Cagan 提过类似的观点。Marty Cagan曾经担任过网景的副总裁，负责eBay 产品的资深副总裁，有过非常丰富的产品设计和产品管理经验。无招也参加过MartyCagan 产品培训，于是我和无招，以Marty Cagan的总结为基础，加上我们对产品设计的理解，整理出了这篇文章，分享给大家。
