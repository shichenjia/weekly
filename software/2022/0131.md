Design is not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works. 这句话是 Jobs 说的。而具体到 DevTools 产品的设计，我持有的大概是更激进的观点： Design is not what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works. 对于我这样一个程序员来说，DevTools 里的留白真的是一种奢侈。

**Deceptive Design Untangled**  
https://webfoundation.org/2022/01/deceptive-design-untangled/  
Deceptive user experiences can come with financial costs, too. Online retailers frequently employ deceptive timers and gamification techniques—you have 43 seconds to grab this incredible deal!—to get consumers to spend more. And in India, unsuspecting parents can soon go into debt when signing up for edtech programmes that appear “free at first glance”.  As Kat Zhou, creator of <Design Ethically>, explains: “It’s our time, our money, and our data that’s on the line. Anti-patterns affect all of us. We deserve better.” Here we untangle the harms of deceptive design and how we can instead move toward trusted design patterns.

**The Old Internet Shows Signs of Quietly Coming Back**  
https://cheapskatesguide.org/articles/old-internet-coming-back.html  
Websites that are original and creative expressions of their creators' personalities were the foundation of the early 1990's Internet. In this article, I will use this as the definition of the term "old Internet", not to imply that these websites are passe, but because their purpose and sometimes even their look has not changed since then. Although the old Internet will not replace the Internet we have today, signs point to it growing in size and visibility as Internet users become increasingly disillusioned with the corporate-run shopping mall that today's Internet has become.  

**The baseline for web development in 2022**  
https://engineering.linecorp.com/en/blog/the-baseline-for-web-development-in-2022/  
The baseline for web development in 2022 is: low-spec Android devices in terms of performance, Safari from two years before in terms of Web Standards, and 4G in terms of networks. The web in general is not answering those needs properly, especially in terms of performance where factors such as an over-dependence on JavaScript are hindering our sites’ performance.

**Researchers Build AI That Builds AI**

A great read on how standardization became important to the Internet Explorer team, thanks to the efforts of the Web Standards Project (WaSP) in pushing Microsoft to build what was then its most standards-compliant browser to date.

**How React server components work: an in-depth guide**  
https://blog.plasmic.app/posts/how-react-server-components-work/  
React server components (RSC) is an exciting new feature that will have huge implications on page load performance, bundle size, and how we write React applications in the near future. We at Plasmic make a visual builder for React, and we care a lot about React performance — many of our customers use Plasmic to build performance-critical marketing and e-commerce sites. And so, even though RSC is still an early experimental feature in React 18, we have been digging into how it works under the hood. In this blog post, we’re excited to share what we’ve learned!

**Two reasons Kubernetes is so complex**  
https://buttondown.email/nelhage/archive/two-reasons-kubernetes-is-so-complex/  
Anthropic runs most of our systems inside of Kubernetes, and so I’ve been gaining a lot more experience and familiarity with that tool. And while it’s been, on net, really great, I’ve definitely also experienced the (near universal, I think) feeling of “holy smokes why is this thing so complicated?” as well as “Why is it so bloody hard to debug anything?”

**How Facebook Is Bringing QUIC to Billions**

Matt Joras and Yang Chi discuss the technical challenges implementing QUIC and HTTP/3, from edge load balancer to mobile clients, and from application tweaking to transport congestion control.

**Think Sustainability While Developing Serverless Applications!**  
https://medium.com/lego-engineering/think-sustainability-while-developing-serverless-applications-d61a37845914  
“All change please; all change!” Famous last words of train guards across the UK rail network as the trains slowly come to a halt at their final destination. A sleepy commuter on an afternoon train may not like these words, whereas someone traveling to meet a friend will be ready to get out and run along the platform in excitement.

**Knowing when to say 'no'**  
https://github.com/readme/guides/decision-framework  
Knowing when and how to say “No” is one of the most important responsibilities of a software maintainer. This applies equally to open and closed source software projects, and it’s a key skill to develop as your scope and influence grow with your seniority. Much has been written about learning to say “No” to new work as an individual who is looking to improve productivity, focus, and work-life balance, but we can also apply these same principles to the world of collaborative software development.

**How to Excel in Tech Without Learning to Code**  
https://future.a16z.com/excel-in-tech-without-learning-to-code/  
Becoming more technically literate will help you work better with engineers, identify chances to automate or improve your workflows, and become a whiz in the tools you use to get your job done and help the business grow. In short, technical literacy provides a path to excel as a non-engineer in a field dominated by engineers.

**Netflix: A Culture of Learning**  
https://netflixtechblog.com/netflix-a-culture-of-learning-394bc7d0f94c  
The secret sauce that turns the raw ingredients of experimentation into supercharged product innovation is culture. There are never any shortcuts when developing and growing culture, and fostering a culture of experimentation is no exception. Building leadership buy-in for an approach to learning that emphasizes A/B testing, building trust in the results of tests, and building the technical capabilities to execute experiments at scale all take time — particularly within an organization that’s new to these ideas. But the pay-offs of using experimentation and the virtuous cycle of product development via the scientific method are well worth the effort. Our colleagues at Microsoft have shared thoughtful publications on how to Kickstart the Experimentation Flywheel and build a culture of experimentation, while their “Crawl, Walk, Run, Fly” model is a great tool for assessing the maturity of an experimentation practice.

**When design consistency is harmful**  
https://medium.com/designing-atlassian/when-design-consistency-is-harmful-39aa69173848  
So the next time you fret about consistency in your or another’s designs, instead ask what the user knows and is trying to achieve, and then discuss what measure of consistency best helps you to achieve those goals and if this case warrants a little inconsistency. As long as the inconsistency is internal it may well be justified. This might not look as good lined up in your Figma files but will help you to better support your users.

**People don't work as much as you think**  
https://drmaciver.substack.com/p/people-dont-work-as-much-as-you-think  
The short version is this: People don’t work nearly as much as you think they do, because everything we say about working hours is a fractal of lies (and indeed one of my examples in the fractal of lies post was about this sort of dynamic!), where everything is based on lies people tell about lies being told to them about… etc. If you do not realise this, and assume that everyone who says they are working eight hours per day actually is, you are probably going to wreck your mental health trying to keep up with them. Stop it at once.

**好产品经理极度稀缺**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/s-EwJhTT0e-i7RsKQeIiTQ  
我在多年前加入百度时，曾经看过一本书《人人都是产品经理》，这本书从名字来说给了很多人希望，但是也误导了很多人，让人以为产品经理是一个进入门槛极低的岗位。但过去几年的观察让我体会到，产品经理是一个门槛极高的岗位，而好产品经理更是稀有物种，这是由几个条件决定的：第一、好产品经理必须具备足够的生活阅历；第二、好产品经理必须洞察人性；第三、好产品经理必须保持克制；第四、好产品经理必须懂生意；第五、好产品经理必须是管理专家；第六、好产品经理必须有决策权，但决策权是自己打出来的。
