**Vite 3.0 is out!**  
https://vitejs.dev/blog/announcing-vite3.html  
16 months from the v2 launch we are happy to announce the release of Vite 3. We decided to release a new Vite major at least every year to align with Node.js's EOL, and take the opportunity to review Vite's API regularly with a short migration path for projects in the ecosystem.

**Scratch is a big deal**  
https://www.bryanbraun.com/2022/07/16/scratch-is-a-big-deal/  
While none of us were paying attention, Scratch has transformed from a programming language for kids to a massive online community of self-guided, student-programmers. Usage has doubled since the pandemic started and the language is now overtaking “real” programming languages (like Typescript and Rust) in language popularity rankings. It’s the realization of over 50 years of effort from programmers and educators, standing on the shoulders of giants like Logo and LEGO Mindstorms. Look up [constructionism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructionism_(learning_theory)) if you’re curious!

**The dream is over for China’s tech workers**  
https://restofworld.org/2022/china-tech-layoffs/  
A government crackdown and economic downturn have led to massive layoffs, but some are relieved to exit the grueling ‘996’ work life.

**From Bootcamp Grad to Software Engineer**  
https://www.simplethread.com/blog-post-from-bootcamp-grad-to-software-engineer/  
Every good software engineer, no matter how experienced and credentialed they are, learns a huge amount every year. It’s just how this industry works at its current stage of immaturity. So beyond your specific set of skills when you apply, what I’m looking for is that continuous learning mindset, proof that you have what it takes to keep learning and growing – evidence that you will become the great software developer you have the potential to be.

**Functional programming is finally going mainstream**  
https://github.com/readme/featured/functional-programming  
OBJECT-ORIENTED AND IMPERATIVE PROGRAMMING AREN’T GOING AWAY, BUT FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING IS FINDING ITS WAY INTO MORE CODEBASES. Releated: [Functional Programming 101](https://github.com/readme/guides/functional-programming-basics).  

**Stack Exchange sites are getting prettier faster: Introducing Themes**  
https://stackoverflow.blog/2022/07/11/stack-exchange-sites-are-getting-prettier-faster-introducing-themes/  
Our April Fools joke has a nice side effect: it's easier to make Stack Exchange sites more distinct. Releated: [the many faces of themeable design systems](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/the-many-faces-of-themeable-design-systems/).

**The joy of Variable Fonts: getting started on the Frontend**  
https://evilmartians.com/chronicles/the-joy-of-variable-fonts-getting-started-on-the-frontend  
In this article, we’ll take a deep look at getting set up with variable fonts on the frontend, look at properly loading them, deal with settings, look at some ‘gotchas’ and more—read and learn!

**CSS complexity - it's complicated**  
https://www.projectwallace.com/blog/css-complexity  
I think Project Wallace is the most powerful tool to explore your CSS, but I also think that browser makers should step up their game here. Google Chrome had a nice start with their CSS Overview, but I think the topic is still largely overlooked and developers are looking for ways to learn more about their CSS, beyond looking at the different colors and fonts.

**Applying SOLID principles in React**  
https://konstantinlebedev.com/solid-in-react/  
https://www.projectwallace.com/  
The good news though, software design principles such as SOLID are language agnostic and have a high level of abstraction, meaning that if we squint hard enough and take some liberties with interpretation, we’ll be able to apply them to our more functional React code. So let’s take some liberties.

**聊聊分布式锁**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/-N4x6EkxwAYDGdJhwvmZLw  
基于 ZooKeeper 的分布式锁，适用于高可靠（高可用）而并发量不是太大的场景；基于 Redis 的分布式锁，适用于并发量很大、性能要求很高的、而可靠性问题可以通过其他方案去弥补的场景。基于 MySQL 的分布式锁一般均有单点问题，高并发场景下对数据库的压力比较大；

**Custom ESM loaders: Who, what, when, where, why, how**  
https://dev.to/jakobjingleheimer/custom-esm-loaders-who-what-when-where-why-how-4i1o  
Custom loaders are a powerful mechanism for controlling an application, providing extensive control over loading modules—be that data, files, what-have-you. This article lays out real-world use-cases. End users will likely consume these via packages, but it could still be useful to know, and doing a small and simple one-off is very easy and could save you a lot of hassle with very little effort (most of the loaders I've seen/written are about 20 lines of code, many fewer).

**Why do so many brands change their logos and look like everyone else?**  
https://velvetshark.com/articles/why-do-brands-change-their-logos-and-look-like-everyone-else  
A few months ago, I received an email from Revolut (a British fintech company) in which they proudly unveiled their new logo. Previously, Revolut had a distinct and instantly recognizable logo. They replaced it with… something I was sure I had seen before.

**Advice for the next dozen Rust GUIs**  
https://raphlinus.github.io/rust/gui/2022/07/15/next-dozen-guis.html  
The motivations for building GUI in Rust remain strong. While Electron continues to gain momentum, especially for desktop use cases, there is considerable desire for a less resource-hungry alternative. That said, a consensus has not emerged what that alternative should look like. In addition, unfortunately there is fragmentation at the level of infrastructure as well. Fragmentation is not entirely a bad thing. To some extent, specialization can be a good thing, resulting in solutions more adapted to the problem at hand, rather than a one-size-fits-all approach. Releated: [How I went about learning Rust](https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2022/how-i-went-about-learning-rust/), [Let's Code Tetris with Rust, WASM, and React](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lAr7JveRVE).  

**3 Reasons an Inefficient Cache Is Worse Than No Cache at All**  
https://thenewstack.io/3-reasons-an-inefficient-cache-is-worse-than-no-cache-at-all/  
At its core, database caching is a simple-enough concept: It is the practice of putting an in-memory datastore in front of (or aside) a database that acts as the system of record. Caching allows organizations to keep frequently requested data in speedy RAM and enhance application performance by reducing calls to slower disk or flash-based databases that persist system data. This efficiency brings incredible performance benefits.

**Resolving Conflicts Between Designers And Engineers**  
https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2022/07/resolving-conflicts-designers-engineers/  
In this article, Scott Himmer will go over some areas where you might find the design and engineering conflicts manifesting, what some of the contributing factors are, and strategies to work through the challenges.

To date, though, web3 governance has overly relied on direct democracy, leading to low participation and concerns about weak oversight, interest-group capture, and group decision-making. There’s room for borrowing best practices from the history of governance system.

**DALL·E 2: Extending Creativity**  
https://openai.com/blog/dall-e-2-extending-creativity/  
As part of our DALL·E 2 research preview, more than 3,000 artists from more than 118 countries have incorporated DALL·E into their creative workflows. The artists in our early access group have helped us discover new uses for DALL·E and have served as key voices as we’ve made decisions about DALL·E’s features. Creative professionals using DALL·E today range from illustrators, AR designers, and authors to chefs, landscape architects, tattoo artists, and clothing designers, to directors, sound designers, dancers, and much more. The list expands every day.

**ECM vs DMS vs KMS: what's right for you?**  
https://www.tiny.cloud/blog/ecm-vs-dms-vs-kms/  
Knowledge workers put knowledge to work. They make decisions (rather than physical items) and ideas are their value currency, not objects. However, there’s a conundrum. Until they put the information they have to work, it can’t become knowledge. So, for an organization to productively use its knowledge workers, it must first organize its information. That's why information, document and knowledge management systems exist.
