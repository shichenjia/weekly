**Move over JavaScript: Back-end languages are coming to the front-end**  
https://github.com/readme/featured/server-side-languages-for-front-end  
https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30269161  
The client-side made a come back over the past decade as developers built “single-page applications” (SPAs) with JavaScript. But a new crop of tools is sending the pendulum swinging back towards the server. My goal is not to get rid of single-page applications, but to obviate them for a large class of applications.

**Updating React at Etsy**  
https://github.com/mq2thez/blog/blob/main/upgrade-react-etsy/preact-vs-react.md  
译文 https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/gkxJ64r3e8WeNP2-dXjRMQ
This doc was shared internally with a survey in order to ensure that I was not dictating the decision for a huge number of engineers. The results were, happily, that Etsy will be upgrading from React v15.6.2 to Preact v10.X. Now, enough with the extra commentary -- here's the doc. Releated: [React - The Missing Parts](https://acko.net/blog/react-the-missing-parts/).

**2021 大前端技术回顾及未来展望**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/HfZDrrqDNUVpnU-aegKxcg  
2021 年大前端领域没有出现革命性的明星项目，但在各个细分的技术领域都有一定的拓展与深耕，有很多新技术或者新特性有望在 2022 年迎来爆发。在互联网 “寒冬” 的当下，前端技术人员唯有修炼好内功，不断壮大自身，才能更好地迎接春天的 “东风”。

**“一把梭：REST API 全用 POST”**  
https://coolshell.cn/articles/22173.html  
“对接同事的接口，他定义的所有接口都是 post 请求，理由是 https 用 post 更安全，之前习惯使用 restful api ，如果说 https 只有 post 请求是安全的话？那为啥还需要 get 、put 、delete ？我该如何反驳他。”

**Case against OOP is understated, not overstated**  
https://boxbase.org/entries/2020/aug/3/case-against-oop/  
Here's something for nobody. We've been past this a long while ago now. OOP is one of those substances that stick to the wall if you throw it. Writing about it is almost always pointless because people who should learn refuse to learn, and everybody else has learnt their lesson.

**How the Angular Compiler Works**  
https://blog.angular.io/how-the-angular-compiler-works-42111f9d2549  
Angular’s compiler serves as a bridge between developer experience and run time performance: Angular users author applications against an ergonomic, decorator-based API, and ngc translates this code into more efficient runtime instructions.

https://germano.dev/sse-websockets/  
When developing real-time web applications, WebSockets might be the first thing that come to your mind. However, Server Sent Events (SSE) are a simpler alternative that is often superior.

**How We Write GitHub Actions in Go**  
https://full-stack.blend.com/how-we-write-github-actions-in-go.html  
At Blend, we’ve benefited from adopting GitHub Actions. We have built tooling that enables writing an action in Go and automates the release process for actions within our GitHub Enterprise instance. Below, we’ll share the set of unique challenges for running and releasing actions written in Go and outline our strategies for solving these problems.

We’re Fly.io. We run container images on our hardware around the world, linked to our Anycast network with a WireGuard mesh. It’s pretty neat, and you should check it out. You can be up and running on Fly.io in single-digit minutes. That's the last thing we're going to say about how great Fly.io is in this post.

**Metadata, not data, is what drags your database down**

Databases today are built for Big Data. But what happens when the metadata is bigger?

**How Postgres Stores Rows**  
https://ketansingh.me/posts/how-postgres-stores-rows/  
Out of curiosity, I was trying to understand how PostgreSQL stores the data onto the disk and there are a few interesting things that I have noticed that might be useful for application developers. In this post, I will try to go into the implementation level details and map out how PostgreSQL row storage really works.

**Robot See, Robot Do**  
https://ai.googleblog.com/2022/02/robot-see-robot-do.html  
People learn to do things by watching others — from mimicking new dance moves, to watching YouTube cooking videos. We’d like robots to do the same, i.e., to learn new skills by watching people do things during training. Today, however, the predominant paradigm for teaching robots is to remote control them using specialized hardware for teleoperation and then train them to imitate pre-recorded demonstrations.

**What is your “I don't care if this succeeds” project?**  
https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30283264  
One where you don't care if it makes money or gets a lot of attention, but you are working on it regardless. I don't think I mean private hobbies, exactly, but projects that could or will be shared with others - you just don't care about the outcome.

**业余做研究的经验**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/vYmGtNSC_z9syoJ5PSA6gw  
这四个月以来，白天去公司干活，晚上在谷歌吃完晚饭后骑车半小时回来继续做自己的研究，一直到晚上十一二点睡觉为止。做的工作仍然是博士阶段的研究课题。这部分工作最近有幸在今年的 ICCV 拿了马尔荣誉奖，但是里面可供挖掘的东西仍然很多，这几个月把空闲时间拼凑起来，取得了不少令人满意的进展。下面说一说这四个月来一下利用业余时间做研究的经验，或者说做“民科”的经验 （笑）。说实话，我不知道自己能坚持这个模式多久，但先总结一下分享给大家，总是好事；另一方面，以后自己懈怠了，再拿出来看看也是不错的。

https://www.uisdc.com/autonomy-relatedness-competence  
心理学家 Richard Ryan 和 Edward Deci 深入研究过人类的行为动机，也提出过一种动机理论，称为自我决定论，它描述了人需要具备了三种基本的心理需求，才能具备「动力」来驱动他们为某件事情投入时间和精力：自主：是否发自内心而非受人影响；归属：是否基于互动的本能，能否制造与人互动的机会；胜任：了解自身的能力，对于结果有明确预期

Designing and creating a great experience can be hard, but it’s even harder to design and create one that considers all users and their diverse and accessible needs in mind.

**Sustainability in Software**  
https://blog.scottlogic.com/2022/02/07/Sustainability-in-Software.html  
Humans are causing climate change; a statement that more people agree with today than ever before in human history. The knowledge that Green House Gas (GHG) emissions are the cause of this change is also growing. So this blog is going to focus on understanding where software, the people who develop said software and GHG emissions intersect.

**Moving to Obsidian as a Public Second Brain**  
https://www.swyx.io/obsidian-brain/  
I’ve gone through many versions of notetaking systems in the past decade, from literal “in memory” storage, to writing cheatsheets, to blogging everything publicly, to storing private notes in OneNote, then SimpleNote, then Notion. For focused topics, I have a long history of making markdown repos on GitHub accumulating thousands of stars. I’ve also considered Evernote, Joplin and Roam and its less culty competitors Foam and Athens. Two months ago I moved my notes to Obsidian, and I’ve been fairly happy with the result. Time for a good ole experience report!
