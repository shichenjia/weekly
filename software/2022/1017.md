**The Web’s Next Transition**  
https://www.epicweb.dev/the-webs-next-transition  
.The web is made up of technologies that got their start over 25 years ago. HTTP, HTML, CSS, and JS were all first standardized in the mid-nineties (when I was 8 years old). Since then, the web evolved into a ubiquitous application platform. As the web has evolved, so too has the architecture for the development of these applications. There are many core architectures for building applications for the web these days. The most popular architecture employed by web developers today is the Single Page App (SPA), but we are transitioning to a new and improved architecture for building web applications.

Climate change and sustainability are increasing concerns for digital organizations, as well as individuals working in tech. In this article, we’ll explore some of the ways we can raise awareness and effect change within an organization to create a more positive environmental impact.

**Using a Framework will harm the maintenance of your software**  
https://berk.es/2022/09/06/frameworks-harm-maintenance/  
In this article I'm putting together my quotes, thoughts and notes on the idea that Frameworks harm the maintainability of the software you build in that framework. I'm proposing that Frameworks: are harming maintainability, but not deliberate. have different goals than you or your team. make trade-offs that harm maintainability of the projects built in them. are designed to take your project hostage. offer some their benefits, and don't harm maintainability, when used in a decoupled fashion.

**Why We Use Babylon.js Instead Of Three.js in 2022**  
https://www.spotvirtual.com/blog/why-we-use-babylonjs-instead-of-threejs-in-2022  
In 2022, it must be said that both frameworks are very robust and comparable for the most part and picking either framework is a relatively safe bet. In reality, most of the above are relative nit-picks, but Babylon.js deserves serious consideration for non-trivial 3D web applications. This post shared some of our own reasoning in terms of making the decision of using Babylon.js for Spot.

**Rethinking Low-Code_No-Code and Open Source, Part 2**  
https://www.nearform.com/blog/rethinking-low-code-no-code-open-source-pt-2/  
Introducing abstraction layers does not come without cost. In the current age of software engineering, visual abstraction layers such as those offered by many low-code/no-code tools often reduce flexibility and come at a higher cost of change. Choose your abstraction layer carefully, mindful of the cost of change.

**Meta Meets Microsoft**  
https://stratechery.com/2022/meta-meets-microsoft/  
I do think that VR has real utility, but it will take time for that utility to be accessible on a cost-effective basis for enterprises and individual users; meaningful social experiences will take longer yet, simply because social experiences depend on the people you want to hang out with being bought in as well.

**OpenAI与AIGC：改变人类生产范式，通往“万物的摩尔定律”**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/Ks8tjJ5ModzopK0WvjVR-A  
人类艺术的发展速度是对数式的，而技术的进步速度是指数式的。生成式 AI 学习了人类艺术对数进化史上的海量画作，实现了创作质量上的指数式进步，并在生产效率上实现了“弯道超车”。模型生成的作品便是今天热议的AIGC (AI Generated Content)。而本文聚焦的公司 OpenAI ，在这场生成式 AI 的突破中起到了关键性的作用，通过堆叠海量算力的大模型（Foundation Model）使 AIGC 进化。在 2022 年上半年，OpenAI 旗下三个大模型 GPT-3、GitHub Copilot 和 DALL·E2 的注册人数均突破了 100 万人，其中 GPT-3 花了 2 年，GitHub Copilot 花了半年，而 DALL·E2 只用了2个半月达到了这一里程碑，足见这一领域热度的提升。

**教育的真正目的，是让人上完学后还想读书！**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/iQ5waAfewycJ83V0ioclsQ

**像培养孩子一样，允许自己的产品慢慢成长**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/_cyUIVmCsbJhLG67oCoLdQ  
产品创新，最好的方式依旧是将最小可行性产品尽早推入市场，在与市场的碰撞和反馈中逐步成长，因为很多问题只有到具体的市场场景中才会浮现。这需要创新人员放下傲慢与偏见，培养一种拾级而上的过程思维，对自己的产品和潜在市场始终充满耐性，像看待一个孩子一样看待自己的产品，对其秉持长期主义思维和开放包容的态度，自己引导的同时也要让其接受社会的调教，放弃完美主义，以一种“大器免成”的态度，与市场共同见证自己产品的成长。
