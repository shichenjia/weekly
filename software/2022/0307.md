**Working together on Interop 2022**

https://web.dev/interop-2022/  
From the very beginning, the web was always intended to work in any browser, on any computer. This is possible through interoperability — when each underlying web technology is implemented in the same way in every browser. To reach interoperability, it takes a commitment from all browser engineers to implement web technology according to web standards — the incredibly detailed specifications where new technology is defined. In 2022, Apple, Bocoup, Google, Igalia, Microsoft, and Mozilla have come together to commit to improve interoperability in 15 key areas that will have the most impact on web developer experience, in a project called Interop 2022.

**Monorepos are changing how teams build software**  
https://vercel.com/blog/monorepos-are-changing-how-teams-build-software  
The largest software companies in the world use monorepos. But historically, adopting a monorepo for anything other than at a Facebook or Google scale was difficult, time-consuming, and often filled with headaches. Since Turborepo joined Vercel, we’ve seen development teams of all sizes adopt Turborepo for faster builds and save over 200 days worth of time by remotely caching their deployments on Vercel. Turborepo takes the lessons and development workflows from the giants of the Web and brings it to open source for every developer. It lowers the barrier to entry for using monorepos and makes it accessible to everyone. Let’s explore how monorepos can improve your development workflow.

**A new year, a new MDN**  
https://hacks.mozilla.org/2022/03/a-new-year-a-new-mdn/  
In mid-2021 we started to think about modernizing MDN’s design, to create a clean and inviting website that makes navigating our 44,000 articles as easy as possible. We wanted to create a more holistic experience for our users, with an emphasis on improved navigability and a universal look and feel across all our pages. Releated: [Is Firefox OK?

**The Future of User Interface Design: Next-generation UI Tools**  
https://www.toptal.com/designers/ui/future-ui-design  
The next wave of UI design tools will fully integrate design and code to provide a seamless experience for designers and developers.

**Google Docs New Feature: Pageless**  
https://support.google.com/docs/thread/150905607/google-docs-new-feature-pageless?hl=en  
We're excited to announce a new feature on Google Docs: pageless! You can now experience a new way to work with documents that is built for the screen! Pageless format allows you to remove the boundaries of a page to create an infinite surface to work on. In this setting, there are no page breaks, images adjust to your screen size, and wide tables are viewable by scrolling left and right. Line breaks for text will adjust to screen size and as you zoom in and out. 

**The Ukraine War - and Its Impact on the Tech Industry**  
https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/the-ukraine-crisis-impact-on-tech/  
We are not living usual times, and so this is not the usual Pragmatic Engineer article. Russia has launched a full-on invasion on Ukraine on Thursday, 24 February. This event has started the largest war in Europe since World War 2 (WW2), and is the largest geopolitical event in Europe since the breakup of the USSR in 1990-1991. This article covers the impact of the war on the tech world.

**10 React Antipatterns to Avoid - Code This, Not That!**  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0IZo2Aho9Y  
React is a minimal on the surface, but it’s actually a highly complex JavaScript UI library with many potential pitfalls. In this tutorial, we look at 10 antipatterns in React, along with tips and tricks to improve our code.

**Web3进行时 – 崩溃、融合与新生**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/09WJf08EUpAf3tlwtb73jw  
Web2与Web3的融合，不可逆转且大势所趋，元宇宙中会诞生一个无限增量市场，而对于规则、标准与话语权的抢夺，会是Web2和Web3融合的主战场。混乱是阶梯，区块链的创业者们也迎来了最后一次的机会窗口。

**防御性设计和开发**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/G4pME9xFHdWnFckgytnofQ  
简而言之，前端开发中的防御性就是防出错。这里的“错”不只是代码报错，而是影响用户使用和用户体验的全部问题。“防”不仅是预防，进一步追求弹复性。弹复性的定义：“系统能从故障中恢复并在面对故障时保持服务可靠性的持久性的能力”（参考阅读：https://www.bmc.com/blogs/resilience-engineering/）。前端开发不仅是简单还原产品设计，而实现更好的产品使用体验。否则就成了“中看不中用”。前端开发的工作和影响必须从实现层（中看）深入到体验层（中用）。

**端智能在大众点评搜索重排序的应用实践**  
https://tech.meituan.com/2022/02/24/edge-search-rerank.html  
搜索是大众点评 App 连接用户与商家的重要渠道，越来越多的用户在不同场景下都会通过搜索来获取自己想要的服务。理解用户的搜索意图，将用户最想要结果排在靠前的位置，是搜索引擎最核心的步骤。为了进一步优化搜索个性化的排序能力，提升用户体验，搜索技术中心进行了在端上部署深度个性化模型的探索实践。本文主要介绍了端智能重排在大众点评 App 上的实践经验，文章主要分为以下三个部分：第一部分主要分析端智能重排要解决的问题和整体流程；第二部分会介绍端上重排序算法部分的探索实践过程；第三部分将介绍端上重排系统的架构设计以及部署优化，最后是总结与展望。

**It's always been you, Canvas2D**  
https://developer.chrome.com/blog/canvas2d/  
In a world of shaders, meshes, and filters, Canvas2D might not get you excited. But it should! 30-40% of web pages have a <canvas> element and 98% of all canvases use a Canvas2D rendering context. There are Canvas2Ds in cars, on fridges, and in space (really).

**5 things you don't need Javascript for**  
https://lexoral.com/blog/you-dont-need-js/  
Javascript can do a lot, but it's really over-used. HTML and CSS are surprisingly powerful on their own, so let's have a look at some of the things you can achieve without Javascript (or a backend) - from animated diagrams to dark mode.

**Accessibility for Real-time Web Apps**  
https://fly.io/blog/intro-to-accessibility/  
Doing accessibility well isn't difficult, especially if you plan ahead. So I'd like to talk a bit about what accessibility is, why you should care, and a few common missteps teams make on their journey.

**Running commands with execa in Node.js**  
https://blog.logrocket.com/running-commands-with-execa-in-node-js/  
The execa library provides a wrapper around the child_process module for ease of use. This popular library was created and is maintained by prolific open-source developer Sindre Sorhus, and it’s downloaded millions of times every week. In this article, we’re going to learn about the benefits of the execa library and how we can start using it. We’ll also dive into the basics of error handling and process control, as well as look at the options we have for handling child process output.

**Why I invented “dash encoding”, a new encoding scheme for URL paths**  
https://simonwillison.net/2022/Mar/5/dash-encoding/  
Datasette now includes its own custom string encoding scheme, which I’ve called dash encoding. I really didn’t want to have to invent something new here, but unfortunately I think this is the best solution to my very particular problem. Some notes on how dash encoding works and why I created it.

**A Decade of Deep Learning: How the AI Startup Experience Has Evolved**  
https://future.a16z.com/a-decade-of-deep-learning-ai-startup/  
In this interview, Socher discusses a number of topics, including: how things have changed for AI startups in the last decade; the differences between doing AI in startups, enterprises, and academia; and how new machine learning techniques, such as transformer models, empower companies to build advanced products with a fraction of the resources they would have needed in the past.

第一次接触电子，记得还是在大学时候从学习模拟电子开始的。学习过程中，看着那些电阻、电容、电感器、二极管、三极管虽然很小，但组装起来以后，变成一个个小设备，实现很多特定功能，感觉这也太神奇了！

**This World Wildlife Day, the key word is adapt**  
https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/sustainability/world-wildlife-day-2022/  
As entire habitats change, land managers and policymakers need to be able to make local land-use decisions that support regionally important species and ecosystems. Cloud-based mapping tools, like TerrAdapt which launched to the public today on World Wildlife Day, can help prioritize areas for conservation actions — like habitat restoration, increasing protection status, and building wildlife crossings. TerrAdapt uses satellite monitoring technology powered by Google Earth Engine and Google Cloud Platform to project habitat conditions given future climate and land-use scenarios.

Design is a team sport. I wish as a designer I could go into my secluded pixel den, and emerge victorious with shining golden final designs, I can’t. You can’t. No good designer can. Why? Because design is a team sport. 

**减少30%的会议时间**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/7AAi2Kyot9l1siiruOtOYw  
其实从对自己、对团队、对公司负责的态度，努力控制会议上的时间花费，都应该成为一个合格管理者的自觉行为。时间和金钱一样，是宝贵的资源。而时间因为其不可再生性，相对更宝贵一些。如果我们从资源的稀缺性角度出发，努力为自己、为团队、为公司省下更多的时间，我们的效率会更高、大家能有多时间学习思考，我们便有机会获得更高的工作质量和更好的工作氛围。
