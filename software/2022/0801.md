**Roll your own JavaScript runtime**  
https://deno.com/blog/roll-your-own-javascript-runtime  
In this post we'll walk through creating a custom JavaScript runtime. Let's call it runjs. Think of it as building a (much) simplified version of deno itself. A goal of this post is to create a CLI that can execute local JavaScript files, read a file, write a file, remove a file and has simplified console API.

**JSON Creator Douglas Crockford Interview**  
https://evrone.com/douglas-crockford-interview  
Douglas Crockford: "The best thing we can do today to JavaScript is to retire it." JavaScript, like the other dinosaur languages, has become a barrier to progress. We should be focused on the next language, which should look more like E than like JavaScript.

**Software Visualization — Challenge, Accepted**  
https://engineering.atspotify.com/2022/07/software-visualization-challenge-accepted/  
https://www.infoq.com/news/2022/07/spotify-system-model-c4/  
Architectural diagrams are the bread and butter of software design and a foundational tool for communication and collaboration on software development. At Spotify, we have an incredibly complex network of thousands of interlinked software systems owned by hundreds of teams, so having a simple way to visualize these connections is essential. While capturing all of our software in one large diagram is technically possible, it would be very hard to understand and navigate. ​​We need tools to look at our architecture at different abstraction levels in order to make good design decisions and evolve our software in a sustainable way. As part of our solution, we leverage a standardized software metadata model to create a common language for communicating software architecture.

**Your Code Doesn't Have to Be a Mess**  
https://www.danielsieger.com/blog/2022/07/25/your-code-doesnt-have-to-be-a-mess.html  
If you’ve been developing software for a while, you know that code has this natural tendency to turn into a mess. Keeping software simple over time is a challenge that keeps me thinking. My last post left you hanging without much concrete advice. This time I will outline a few high-level strategies to keep software simple.

Testing is not just about tools and processes. It’s about architecture. In this article, Noam Rosenthal will share his experience on how to organize testing and find the right balance between front-end and subsystems and between different strategies.

**Why Retool rebuilt our UI component library from scratch**  
https://retool.com/blog/redesigned-ui-component-library/  
From 2017 to 2021, this component library was built on top of Ant Design, one of the most popular React UI libraries. But as our customers and company scaled, this decision presented limitations: we were building increasingly brittle hacks and maintaining hundreds of manual overrides in our codebase to offer better customization or functionality on Ant’s baselines.

**10 Tips for Building Resilient Payment Systems**  
https://shopify.engineering/building-resilient-payment-systems  
It’s hard to learn something when you don’t know what you don’t know. As I learned things over the years—sometimes the hard way—I eventually found myself passing on these lessons to others. I distilled these topics into a presentation I gave to my team and boiled that down into this blog post. So, without further ado, here are my top 10 tips and tricks for building resilient payment systems.

We’re sharing insights into our internal guidance on the various languages that play an important role at Meta — and specifically our server-side programming languages, to which Rust is the latest addition.

**The tar archive format, its extensions, and why GNU tar extracts in quadratic time**  
https://mort.coffee/home/tar/  
A couple of days ago, I had a 518GiB tar.gz file (1.1 TiB uncompressed) that I had to extract. At first, GNU tar was doing a great job, chewing through the tar.gz at around 100MiB/s. But after a while, it slowed significantly; down to less than a kilobyte per second. pv's time estimate went from a bit over an hour, to multiple hours, to over a day, to almost a week. After giving it some time, and after failing to find anything helpful through Google, I decided that learning the tar file format and making my own tar extractor would probably be faster than waiting for tar. And I was right; before the day was over, I had a working tar extractor, and I had successfully extracted my 1.1TiB tarball. I will explain why GNU tar is so slow later in this post.

**How to drive away your best engineers**

Tenures are at an all-time low in the software industry. Based on exit interviews I have done over the years, here is a list of reasons, and possible fixes, on why engineers leave their jobs. And while no one example below is a flip the table thing, over time, it will grind people down until they see no hope and leave.

**I Raised My Kids On the Command Line...and They Love It**  
https://lifehacker.com/i-raised-my-kids-on-the-command-line-and-they-love-it-5974087  
Two years ago, my son Jacob (then 3) and I built his first computer together. I installed Debian on it, but never put a GUI on the thing. It's command-line, and has provided lots of enjoyment off and on over the last couple of years. The looks of shock I get from people when I explain, as if it's perfectly natural, that my child has been able to log in by himself to a Linux shell since age 3, are amusing and astounding. Especially considering that it is really not that hard. Instead of learning how to run an Xbox, he's learned how to run bash. I like that.

**Interface ideas for the OS of the future**

The most interesting ones are patterns that could be used throughout the system with many different kinds of items. Today’s lab note is about one of those patterns. It’s nothing groundbreaking, but it starts to show some of the styles of thinking that an itemized OS could allow for.

**做好自己，而不是做更好的自己**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/HdukQxG0gJh8O0tpMePqDA  
做好自己，只是向着更真实本色的自己，原来的而蒙尘的自己，并安住于此。做更好的自己则是不仅迷失了自己，还要用臆想构建出一个假的自己。先做得自己，再谈做好自己；先知道自己是谁，再谈做得自己。
