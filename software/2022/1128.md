**The Perks of a High-Documentation, Low-Meeting Work Culture**  
https://www.tremendous.com/blog/the-perks-of-a-high-documentation-low-meeting-work-culture  
Our low-meeting culture allows us time to do high-value tasks. Our high-documentation culture is the secret sauce that makes us more productive, transparent, thoughtful, scalable, and efficient. We couldn’t afford to cut down on meetings if we didn’t document our thought processes, decisions, and projects so diligently and openly. At times, it does seem like a lot of work. But it pays dividends, and you can write whenever you like. The following are five discrete benefits to a high-documentation, low-meeting culture that we’ve seen first-hand at Tremendous. But the intangible, overarching benefit of practicing meeting mindfulness is this: you spend less of your day sort-of-listening and more of your day really thinking. 

**You, the developer, are a user too**  
https://the.scapegoat.dev/you-the-developer-are-a-user-too/  
Approaching building systems by thinking of developers as its first users not only ensures smoother engineering processes and developer happiness but also sheds light on unclear parts of the design and enforces good practices from the start.

**React Native in 2022 and Beyond**  
https://semaphoreci.com/blog/react-native  
Since its inception, we have seen React Native grow into one of the most popular frameworks for mobile app development. Over the last few years, there have been times when many needed clarification about the future of React Native and if it would be able to keep up with the ever-increasing demands of fluent user experiences. As it happens, React Native has kept up well in delivering best-in-class experiences for small, medium, and large-scale applications. Let’s look at the cool stuff that has landed in React Native this year and what we can expect in the foreseeable future.

**Using the cloud to scale Etsy**  
https://martinfowler.com/articles/bottlenecks-of-scaleups/etsy-cloud-scale.html  
While the cloud migration was happening, Etsy was growing its business and its team. Mike identified the product delivery process as being another potential scaling bottleneck. The autonomy afforded to product teams had caused an issue: each team was delivering in different ways. Joining a team meant learning a new set of practices, which was problematic as Etsy was hiring many new people. In addition, they had noticed several product initiatives that did not pay off as expected. These indicators led leadership to re-evaluate the effectiveness of their product planning and delivery processes.

**An Interactive Guide to Flexbox**  
https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/interactive-guide-to-flexbox/  
Flexbox is a remarkably powerful layout mode. When we truly understand how it works, we can build dynamic layouts that respond automatically, rearranging themselves as-needed.

**Not so serverless Neptune**  
https://www.jeremydaly.com/not-so-serverless-neptune/  
Back then, “serverless” was still relatively new, and the possibilities were seemingly endless. Sure, there were a few people starting to mislabel things, and of course, haters were gonna hate, but for the most part, the argument was less about the nuances of the technology and more about the “nature” of serverless and the serverless-first mindset. But then something changed. Releated: [Why Serverless Direct Integrations Aren’t As Scary As They Sound](https://www.readysetcloud.io/blog/allen.helton/direct-integrations-arent-scary/).

**SQL or NoSQL? Why not use both (with PostgreSQL)?**  
https://supabase.com/blog/sql-or-nosql-both-with-postgresql  
It's a tough decision for any developer starting a new project. Should you store your data in a standard, time-tested SQL database, or go with one of the newer NoSQL document-based databases? This seemingly simple decision can literally make or break your project down the line. Choose correctly and structure your data well, and you may sail smoothly into production and watch your app take off. Make the wrong choice and you could be headed for nightmares (and maybe even some major re-writes) before your app ever makes it out the door.

**How Precision Time Protocol is being deployed at Meta**

The journey to PTP has been years long, as we’ve had to rethink how both the timekeeping hardware and software operate within our servers and data centers.  We are sharing a deep technical dive into our PTP migration and our innovations that have made it possible

**The Evolution of Mathematical Software**  
https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2022/12/266926-the-evolution-of-mathematical-software/abstract  
Many of those who want to hasten that growth believe the most progressive steps in that direction require much more community focus on the vital core of computational science: software and the mathematical models and algorithms it encodes. Of course, the general and widespread obsession with hardware is understandable, especially given exponential increases in processor performance, the constant evolution of processor architectures and supercomputer designs, and the natural fascination that people have for big, fast machines. I am not exactly immune to it. When it comes to championing computational modeling and simulation as a new part of the scientific method, the complex software "ecosystem" that coincides must be forefront.

**Little Languages Are The Future Of Programming**  
https://chreke.com/little-languages.html  
I’ve become convinced that “little languages”—small languages designed to solve very specific problems—are the future of programming, particularly after reading Gabriella Gonzalez’s The end of history for programming and watching Alan Kay’s Programming and Scaling talk. You should go check them out because they’re both excellent, but if you stick around I’ll explain just what I mean by “little languages” and why they’re important.

**Why writing by hand is still the best way to retain information**  
https://stackoverflow.blog/2022/11/23/why-writing-by-hand-is-still-the-best-way-to-retain-information/  
Typing might be faster, but longhand stays with you better.

**Reopening the mind: how cognitive closure kills creative thinking**  
https://nesslabs.com/cognitive-closure  
The need for cognitive closure is the motivation to find an answer to ambiguous situations — any answer that aligns with our existing knowledge. Not only can it lead us to make mistakes based on erroneous assumptions, but it can obscure the path to innovation.

**Building a simple business is difficult**  
https://ghost.org/resources/building-a-simple-business-is-difficult/  
It's easy to overcomplicate what's required to succeed online. The cacophony of "business experts" will try to convince you of a million different actions to take...simultaneously. But remember, complexity is a distraction. It takes massive amounts of discipline to say no to good things as you focus on your one thing. This week, let's help you stay on the right track.

**爱自己：如何**  
https://ourai.ws/posts/how-to-love-yourself-part-3/  
若是真的爱自己的话，就得放弃对那些虚名的执着，仅以健康且幸福地活下去作为唯一目标；而要实现这一目标，所面临的最大挑战就是如何淡然地面对「世界」的自然面与社会面，以及与「人」交互所带来的困扰。最重要的是先打造出符合自然的思维框架并填充进几个相对泛用化的思维模式；还有就是建立起能够以出世的态度看待「世界」的「信仰」。入世时，将顺应天道、以人为本作为行为准则——道德只能用来自我约束，不能去要求并绑架他人；用自己的智识、德行等去吸引影响他人，而非用规则、权力等去限制迫使他人。要想做到且做好上述几点，就得能够终身学习，不断完善并强化自己。

**施一公：如何做一名优秀的博士生**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/Jxgly4FXtpKDYdLV6xykuQ  
本文主要来自我在 2008 年清华大学研究生入学教育里一次 2.5 小时的讲座，又综合了一些随后的思考和总结。在那次讲座中，我一再强调，我的目的不是要求研究生完全按照我讲的去做，而是希望从根本上冲击、振荡一下研究生的思考角度，启发大家找到最适合自己的成才之路。

**当一所学校开始走下坡路，有哪些迹象？**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/-vir4k-dSmf90iWZCidXYA  
一个人积极进取时，其精神也必然是饱满的；当一所学校处于上升阶段时，也必然是充满活力和人心思齐之时。从这个意义上说，当一个团队、一所学校，推崇诸如以下几方面，或是这几方面表现突出时，也往往意味着这个集体已开始有走“下坡路”的征兆了。
