**Basecamp Shape Up: Stop Running in Circles and Ship Work that Matters**  
https://basecamp.com/shapeup/  
This book is a guide to how we do product development at Basecamp. It’s also a toolbox full of techniques that you can apply in your own way to your own process. Whether you’re a founder, CTO, product manager, designer, or developer, you’re probably here because of some common challenges that all software companies have to face. Releated:

**Next.js Layouts RFC**  
https://nextjs.org/blog/layouts-rfc  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/i0_2x7oStasyhTtucJBzaw  
This RFC introduces new routing conventions and syntax. The terminology is based on React and standard web platform terms. Throughout the RFC, you'll see these terms linked back to their definitions below.

**Faster JavaScript Builds with Metro**  
https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/faster-javascript-builds-with-metro-cfc46d617a1f  
How Airbnb migrated from Webpack to Metro and made the development feedback loop nearly instantaneous, the largest production build 50% faster, with marginal end-user runtime improvements.

**More thoughts on SPAs**  
https://nolanlawson.com/2022/05/25/more-thoughts-on-spas/  
My last post ([“The balance has shifted away from SPAs”](https://nolanlawson.com/2022/05/21/the-balance-has-shifted-away-from-spas/)) attracted a fair amount of controversy, so I’d like to do a follow-up post with some clarifying points.  

**Minimalism in Programming Language Design**  
https://pointersgonewild.com/2022/05/23/minimalism-in-programming-language-design/  
Designing a programming language to be intentionally minimalistic is an idea that’s highly underrated in my opinion. Most modern programming languages adopt much more of a maximalist design approach. Rapidly adding new features is seen as a competitive edge over other programming languages. The general thinking seems to be that if your language doesn’t have feature X, then people will choose to use another language, or that adding more features is an easy way to show progress. This line of thinking is simplistic, and disregards many other key aspects that are necessary for a programming language to succeed and thrive, such as learnability, stability, tool support and performance.

**Angular’s Vision for the Future**  
https://blog.angular.io/angulars-vision-for-the-future-3cfca5e7b448  
Improving and simplifying the developer experience is a major theme we started to work on in 2022 and will continue into 2023 and beyond. We are excited to see the first step launch in v14 with Standalone components in developer preview. This is only the start in rethinking the developer journey and experience, with an emphasis on the initial learning journey.

**Customizing Color Fonts on the Web**  
https://webkit.org/blog/12662/customizing-color-fonts-on-the-web/  
Color fonts provide a way to add richness to your designs without sacrificing any of the many benefits of using plain text. Regardless of how decorative a color font is, the underlying text is always searchable, copy/paste-able, scalable, translatable, and compatible with screen readers. WebKit now supports CSS @font-palette-values. With this at-rule, you can access predefined color palettes provided by the font designer, and you can customize them in order to make the color font a perfect match for the colors in your designs.

**Applying DDD To Architect a Digital Bank Part 1: Analyzing domain using Subdomains**  
https://shekhargulati.com/2022/05/28/applying-ddd-to-architect-a-digital-bank-part-1-analyzing-domain-using-subdomains/  
In this series on DDD we will demystify DDD by applying it to a real domain so that we can learn how it can help us in architecting systems. This is going to be a learning experience for me as well. I am writing this series as I apply DDD at work. I might make mistakes so please reach out to me via comment section or contact form. In this post I will cover how Subdomains, DDD strategic design pattern, can help you analyze and understand the banking domain.

**React state management libraries in 2022**  
https://www.albertgao.xyz/2022/02/19/react-state-management-libraries-2022/  
The React state management library is a constant topic in React community, but seems we are pretty settled recently with some obvious winners. This blog will focus all the popular choices and compare them so one can have a quick understanding of the libraries, and when to use them. You can also take it as a super quick crash course to all the libraries that listed here. (If you feel one not listed, let me know, I will check and add :D )

**Keep the web free, say no to Web3**  
https://yesterweb.org/no-to-web3/
Low tech user interfaces are not a solution for every product. But, if you’re a product or user interface designer, I encourage you to consider low-tech solutions when working on new products. If nothing else, treat it as a thought exercise or design challenge: how can you turn your multi-screen touch-based design into a simplified user interface that relies on nothing more than icons, LEDs, and a segmented display? What is the smallest number of user interface elements that you can use and still produce an intuitive and engaging user experience? If you embrace the challenge, you might be surprised by the designs you create.

**A Kernel Hacker Meets Fuchsia OS**  
https://a13xp0p0v.github.io/2022/05/24/pwn-fuchsia.html  
Fuchsia is a general-purpose open-source operating system created by Google. It is based on the Zircon microkernel written in C++ and is currently under active development. The developers say that Fuchsia is designed with a focus on security, updatability, and performance. As a Linux kernel hacker, I decided to take a look at Fuchsia OS and assess it from the attacker's point of view. This article describes my experiments.

**Why SQLite may become foundational for digital progress**  
https://venturebeat.com/2022/05/20/why-sqlite-may-become-foundational-for-digital-progress/  
Is SQLite one of the foundations for the next generation of the internet? Some think so. Cloudflare announced that they were deploying a new database service built around the backend tool. Meanwhile, Fly announced that it was hiring one of the developers of Litestream, an open-source project that enhances the basic version of SQLite by adding the capability to replicate the data to increase performance and survivability.

**GTD in 15 minutes – A Pragmatic Guide to Getting Things Done**  
https://hamberg.no/gtd#what-is-gtd  
GTD—or “Getting things done”—is a framework for organizing and tracking your tasks and projects. Its aim is a bit higher than just “getting things done”, though. (It should have been called “Getting things done in a much better way than just letting things happen, which often turns out not to be very cool at all”.) Its aim is to make you have 100% trust in a system for collecting tasks, ideas, and projects—both vague things like “invent greatest thing ever” and concrete things like “call Ada 25 August to discuss conference schedule”. Everything!

**为何做减法如此之难：爱做加法真不是产品经理的锅，是人性使然**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/1BMH8_u53ad5a-tnJrWt6w  
本文是源自 2021 年 4 月在自然杂志的一篇论文的概述，主要用来论证爱做加法不是产品经理的毛病，而是所有人类共通的「默认值」，也再次证明「少即是多」「如无必要，勿增实体」等说法具有的智慧。生活也是如此，买买买比断舍离更简单 —— 但需要记住差异化才能生存，泯然众生是宇宙引力 —— 所以做减法，也是一种抵抗泯然众生引力的方式。因为只有人类才能为宇宙熵增做减法。

**1928年，毛泽东发现了历史和人性中隐藏最深的大秘密（下）**

事实上，我们做任何一件事情，包括创业，其实根本的逻辑链条也应该是这样。而为了让这篇文章更经得起考验，我决定再多说一点。既然一切为了打赢，那如何解释我们后期放弃延安？要知道，在古代，任何一次起义运动，只要被攻入首都基本就可以宣布失败了，包括李自成起义、太平天国运动等。我理解，因为解放战争时期的我们，已经不争一城一地之得失，而是要全盘胜利了。偶尔输一次，把延安让给你又如何？我们要的是全国的胜利。而且，这个时候，我们已经赢了很多次，内部已经建立起来必胜的信念，老百姓也都知道了你的实力，哪怕是偶尔的一次失利都不会影响到民心，何况是这种为了最终战略，故意漏出的破绽呢？要知道，我们让出延安的同时。可是在别的地方，不停地打胜仗啊。这已经是从战术上的“赢”上升到了战略上的“赢”了。
